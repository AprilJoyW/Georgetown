0,"Let me begin by saying that there are two kinds of people, those who will give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars and rave about it to everyone they know, or... people who can't get past the broken phone, blood stains, beeping fire alarms, peg-legged receptionist, lack of water pressure, cracked walls, strange smells, questionable elevator, televisions left to die after the digital conversion, and the possibility that the air conditioner may fall out the window at any moment. That being said, I whole-heartedly give the Tokyo Hotel 5 stars. This is not a place to quietly slip in and out of with nothing to show but a faint memory of the imitation Thomas Kinkade painting bolted to the wall above your bed. And, there is no continental breakfast or coffee in the lobby. There are a few vending machines, but I'm pretty sure they wont take change minted after 1970. Here your senses will be assaulted, and after you leave you will have enough memories to compete with a 1,000 mile road-trip. I beg anyone who is even mildly considering staying here to give it a chance. The location is prime. We were able to walk down Michigan Ave and the river-walk in the middle of the night, all without straying too far from the hotel. There is a grocery store a block away and parking (which may cost more that your hotel room) across the street. Besides, this place is cheap. Super-cheap for downtown Chicago. The closest price we found in the area was four times as expensive. But, be sure to grab some cash. They don't accept credit cards. Some rules though: - Say hello to Clifton Jackson, the homeless guy by Jewel-Osco. - Buy him a drink, some chicken and look him up on Facebook. - Stay on the 17 floor. All the way at the top. - Go out the fire escape (be sure to prop the door open or you'll have a looong walk down) - Be very very careful. - Explore. (Yes, that ladder will hold your weight) - Be very very careful. - Don't be alarmed by any weird noises you hear. - Spend the night on the roof. 17 stories up, in the heart of Chicago. - Write your own Yelp review. I want to see that others are getting the Tokyo Hotel Experience. - Check out is at noon. Be sure to drink lots of water. - Spend the next day hung over. And... Please be careful on the roof.",5
1,"The only place inside the Loop that you can stay for $55/night. Also, the only place you can have a picnic dinner and get a little frisky on the 17th floor roof and then wake up in your room the next morning to an army of ants going in on your picnic leftovers.",3
2,"I have walked by the Tokyo Hotel countless times. It reminds me of the type place that Peter Parker lives in in the Spiderman movies, Or the sort of place Marla Singer might live in, or maybe it is a carbon copy of the Hotel Zamenhof. Basically it is scuzzy and sleazy, through and through it is a fleabag, and I love it. Yesterday I finally walked in. I don't know why. Maybe because I just told my roommates and my landlord that I wouldn't be signing another lease, essentially leaving me ""pre-homeless"". Maybe because earlier that day I told boss that I'm quitting my job at the end of July, leaving me ""pre-unemployed"". Maybe because after all this time teetering between living on the edge of salvation and the brink of self destruction, I'm finally choosing my path, I'm hitting bottom. I'm giving up. Shit maybe I'm Nick Cage in Leaving Las Vegas, but where is my Elizabeth Shue? Who will look after me, who will walk me gently into that good night? If I choose to stay in this city, the city I love, then I may just stay in the ""Hotel Tokyo"". Because if I choose to stay, and that is a big if, then I'm going to need to stay somewhere cheap, with like-minded vagabonds, vagrants and naredowells. I'll need help, I'll need guidance.",5

4,"This place is disgusting, absolutely horrible, it is my second stay here, there is a strange stain on the other side of the bed I stay on, and my friends and I are rendered air conditionless, but it is 55 for downtown Chicago, what am I suppose to do?",3
5,"Disgusting!!!  There is literally duct tape holding together the elevator.  Crack heads live here.. not safe!  Walked in, bought a room.. saw it and left.  No locks on doors, no parking, no air conditioning, no way! For the $$ you pay for the room ($ 55 a night) and parking ($ 38 a night) you could stay down the street at The Ohio House and NOT sleep with one eye open.  Would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.  Seriously, DO NOT STAY HERE!",1
6,"This hotel came up on Hotwire for $108 a night.  We wanted to stay in this area so we took it.  The Tremont is an older hotel updated to boutique style.  I'm rather amazed by some of the other snarky reviews -- if you want rooms like the Drake or the Four Seasons, book yourselves there and pay the price!   In fact, our room (910) was fine.  It's a bit small, but large enough to hold a rather monumental king size bed with a giant headboard.  Perfectly comfortable.  There's decent free WiFi and plenty of outlets.  The bathroom has a slightly odd layout but is a bit larger than at the Inn of Chicago, where we stayed the first two nights we were in town. You also can't beat the location -- half a block west of Michigan Ave. at the Water Tower.  So there's no end of shopping and dining facilities.  You're a couple of blocks walk to Oak Street Beach and the El station.   It's true that there's only one elevator, so be prepared for it to be slow, especially when it's check-out time.  But this is a small quibble.  Haven't tried the continental breakfast at Ditka's yet.  But we did notice a café in the plaza at the John Hancock building across Michigan Ave. that offers breakfast, coffees, etc. that probably should be decent.  There's also a Starbucks right across the street from the hotel.  Also the hotel has only 20 TV channels and doesn't carry MSNBC, to which I'm kind of addicted.   In short, no real complaints.  The Tremont more than meets our needs at a great price!",4
7,"Good location, really run down. I am surprised SPG lends their reputation to this property.",2
8,"Beautiful lobby. The rest is a dump. The elevator should be in an amusement park. The rooms are nice, if you like lumpy beds, peeling wallpaper, caked on dust on the air vents, disgusting bathrooms, and zero customer service. If they were a hostel, I'd be more understanding. But this place purports to be a classy old hotel.   If you're a hobo looking for a flophouse, this might be for you. There are plenty of dumpsters nearby for any biscuit-spearing you might have on your itinerary.  By all means, catch a cannonball to chi-town but mind the bone polishers. If you are a non-hobo, look elsewhere.",1
9,"Stayed here when I went to Chicago for a wedding.  The hotel had an old world charm that my husband and I liked and made us choose this over something more modern.  Yes, the hotel only had 1 small elevator which made it a little inconvenient when there were multiple groups (with luggage) at the same time, which reminded me of a hotel in Europe.  The rooms were modest, the bathroom was fine, everything was clean... not luxurious, but what do you expect.  The location itself is conveniently located just off the main street.  I think we ended up paying $160 per night (after taxes were added) during the weekend in July, which was cheap for that area when we looked.  Overall, fairly comfortable and affordable, a decent option.",3
10,"I bleed SPG loyalty blood to the point where I will walk or drive an extra 15-20 minutes to stay at a Starwood property just to get the points, but if the Westins downtown are booked again...I think that I may have to reconsider my tactics, because The Tremont is a dump.   This property is an embarrassment to the brand. Three things come to mind. 1)  The room's wallpaper and paint were perhaps current when leisure suits were legitimately fashionable. 2)  The hotel doesn't have a gym or a restaurant. 3)  I called down to the front desk because someone literally stole the cord off the back of the television and I wanted to watch the news, but there was no answer.  What kind of @!#$%!@#$ hotel doesn't answer at the front desk?  I ended up calling six times and never got through to the front desk, so I finally just took the one (yes, one) elevator down there.  I couldn't find a single person who works for the hotel. Stay classy, Tremont.  I won't be back.",1
11,"I'm a SPG Platinum member and can't believe that Starwood even keeps this property in their portfolio.  I'm writing from the dingy room as we speak. Pro:  It was $100 for a Thursday-Sunday room in early December, when prices usually spike around the Magnificent Mile. Cons: only 1 (slow) elevator, very old and dingy decor, poor front desk service, no movies, very few electrical plugs. I could have chosen between the Hampton Inn and Tremont.  I stayed at the Hampton  a month ago and should have stayed there again.  Yes it's cheap and close to Michigan Ave, but if you are a business traveller and accustomed to SPG standards, this is not your place!",2
12,"Pros: fantastic location at a good price, stately building, big comfortable bed Cons: slightly smelly room, horrible hot water pressure, no on-command movie TV system, front desk usually unoccupied Overall: would use again, but first would try other comparably-priced hotels in same neighborhood.",3
13,"I stayed here a couple of times in 2011, as this was the hotel-of-choice for my sister's wedding last summer.  It definitely had a lot of charm, but it was quite outdated and a bit run down (peeling wallpaper, for example).  The elevator was INCREDIBLY SLOOOOOW - and just one passenger elevator for 16 floors meant lots of waiting around.  (There was a service elevator that some used instead, but it was equally as slow.)  For the location and the price, though, it's a pretty good place to stay.",3
14,"let us begin with the seven min wait for the one elevator.  we get to the room and the key card will not work.  the new one works after 4 or5 swipes.  the a/c works great after eight hrs.  if one person wishes to take a shower and the other a bath you are in luck because the tub does not drain.  also if you are not sure if you should be green and use only one towel, the tremont makes this easy! They only give you one towel per person.  I must say it really is in a great location and the people that work there are really nice, This place just needs lots of work.",1
15,"This is an older property, so the decor is dated. This is not up to par with other SPG properties. No gym. A sparse continental breakfast of desserts and cereal is provided in the adjacent Ditka's restaurant. My bf is an SPG platinum elite member. Daniel upgraded us to the penthouse suite three days before our reservation. However when we arrived, it was unavailable due to construction. We were transferred to a suite in which one shower did not function, and the bathroom reeked of urine. We complained to the manager, who stated she did not smell anything unusual. With the help of our SPG representative, we switched to a different hotel.",1
16,"Traveling on a budget is what brought me here. If I was not I would have been at the Sofitel or the Grad Hyatt. Location, location, location is the draw here. Located near North Michigan, and Rush is very convenient. Initially we had a queen and requested to upgrade to a Kind facing the front. They did this without any extra charge. Kudos to the staff for being accommodating. I have to warn you though, the carpet mixed with the burning candles they have throughout the lobby was nauseating to me. The carpet needs to be changed in the lobby as well as in the elevator. The floor and the rooms were fine thought, Thank God! This hotel has so much potential to redeem it's old world charm, but it seems like money may be tight.",2
17,"Small Rooms....one elevator that takes forever to come down to the first floor.  Had a second elevator or service elevator, but it did not work at all.  The elevator that worked could only hold 5 people at a time.  One plus is the location.   Ditkas was Awesome and right next door.",2
18,"Great location, terribly outdated. Feels like my grandmother decorated it, complete with overwhelming smell of cranberry potpourri in the lobby. Nothing extra, no frills, no service, no greeting when you walk ing. You can pay $5 for muffins and coffee in the morning, no eggs, no room service. If you're on a budget, at least it's clean, maybe not comfortable.",2
19,"As Martha would say, ""What a dump!"" Although not without its charm, the Tremont is old and with the apparent exception of the penthouse suite described below, not very well kept. The elevator creaks and makes thumping noises. My room smelled mildewy, the wallpaper was peeling, and the paint was chipped. The AC (which had an ""on"" setting and an ""off"" setting) pumped dusty air through a rusty vent surrounded by a corona of water stains in the ceiling. At 11:30 pm, I awoke to the sound of a door slamming over and over and over again. I staggered out into the hall to confront whatever ingrate was making the noise only to find that the elevator was stuck on the floor and the door was opening and slamming shut. During my three night stay, my key card magically deactivated four times. Don't be fooled by their website, which lists room amenities that you may find within. There is no room service, no in-room coffee pots, and when I asked about the promised in hotel ""fitness center,"" the desk clerk said I could go to the Westin Hotel around the corner and, once they called the Tremont to verify my status as guest, use theirs. The TV in my room offered a dim, warped, off-color view of the five available channels. There are no window screens and a card on the desk cautioned that opening a window would lead to bugs, attracted by the lights, flying into the room. Because I am soft, I gave the place three stars because the employees are polite, helpful, and well-practiced in coping with angry guests. The lobby is also gorgeous and I had a pretty decent view of the Hancock out of my window. It is also cheap as hell for a hotel off Michigan Ave. Still, if you are looking for a hotel with more comfort and less character, and you can afford it, stay somewhere else.",3
20,"My husband and I came to Chicago for a week and decided to stay here. The price was right and it's in a very convenient neighborhood. Yes, it's old and small but we had a good time here. We stayed in a room with one queen bed and it was more spacious than I thought it would be. You could tell one wall had some water damage at one time, but everything was clean and everything worked. I didn't deal with the staff besides checking in and out, but the people I did speak with were friendly. There weren't a ton of amenities but I didn't come to Chicago to hang out in my hotel room. The train is only a few blocks away and you're surrounded by tons of places to go shopping. I would definitely stay here again.",4
21,"My mom stayed here 4 or 5 years ago and loved its quaint charm, so when she met me in Chicago at the tail end of a business trip, we were excited to find that Hotwire had placed us here. Things have apparently changed. No room service, no vending or ice machines on the floors and no in-room coffee. The room was clean but a bit beyond ""charming"" in terms of falling apart. The blinds were broken in the bedroom and there weren't any in the bathroom, so you got to pee and shower in full view of the church below and the adjacent corner of hotel rooms. The water didn't drain out of the tub, so by the time I finished a quick shower, I was already shin-deep in water. SICK. The elevators were terrifying. I am all for old, quaint, authentic and charming but this place has really let itself go. Get me some coffee in my god-damned room and some ice machines so I can keep my champagne cold and I'll stop bitching. Promise.",3
22,"Stayed here over the Jan 15th weekend.  The location is perfect! Close to Michigan Avenue, train and of course Giordano's. Inviting entrance to the hotel with a canopy with heat lamps when you walk up. The elevator is small and a little rickety but it does the job. I would bring your own towels as the hotel ones are a bit scratchy. Didn't encounter the hotel staff much, just at check in/out -they were polite.  I would stay again when in town.",4
23,"Checked into  the room for the Cubs-Cardinals series in early August.  Found the rate online and my critieria was cheap so I guess I can't complain.  Location was great.  Steps from Michigan Ave and Rush St.  On the down side, as we were checking in, a woman at the front desk was asking how to make the tv work, because she could only get a couple channels.  ""Oh...sorry...our cable is out until next week.""  Yeah...right! That should have been the first sign that this long-in-the-tooth motel was going to be no-frills.  So, not only is the tv limited to local only snow-casts, but having imbibed on great Chicago chow, I soon discovered that the toilet takes about 10 minutes and 5 or 6 flushes to disappear the package.  Yucko! Still, with its proximity to just about everything, it was quite a bargain for 3 nights ($159 per).  Just would have appreciated a little love on the bill after the cable outage. Ditka's adjoining restaurant made it barable.",2
24,"This is a gem of a hotel just off the Magnificent Mile.  The rooms are nothing to get excited about, but the location and the staff make it great.  If you're looking for the typical big chain hotel room, this isn't it.  If you want a quaint hotel, with comfy beds, hot water, and clean sheets, this is perfect.  Great rates available just check the hotel sites for deals. Ditka's place is right next door for eats, and Starbucks is across the street...perfect!",4
25,"Breakfast no longer free, but the wifi is. The staff were friendly and responsive, and the price-for-location hard to beat.",4
26,"In some aspects I have to agree with Sam from Indiana. But, I do have to say when we get away, SERVICE is a huge thing.  Zaiia at the front desk and the Bellman Tom were very nice to us through our whole entire visit. Valet Parking = $49/day with in and out privileges. (We walked or cabbed it everywhere) We too received this through Hotwire...",3
27,cheap hotel for the location.. i paid under a 100 bucks a night (not including tax)... as for the hotel itself.. it's a bit dated.. however the bed is really comfortable.. towels are relatively soft too there's only 1 elevator available for customers.. however they will open up the service elevator if it's busy.. the wifi is free and pretty quick too..,3
28,"I can't imagine paying full price to stay here. We got a deal from a travel site, which made it worthwhile because the location is terrific. The photos on yelp seem to be professionally lit, and very misleading. If I had paid full price, I would have been pissed. But, if you're the sort of person who can deal with a youth hostel, then you'll love it here! The lobby is clean and inviting, but the charm disappears after that. Our room was small, dingey, with blistering walls, painted on crown molding, and worn drapes. No refrigerator or anything, so don't bring home any leftovers. But, on the bright site, the bed and sheets were very clean. The mattress seemed quite new--I'm a mattress inspector the instant I walk into any hotel room. The shower had AWESOME water pressure and got quite hot quite fast, and the AC could pump a lot of cold air in fast. I imagine this place was quite the jewel like 30 years ago. We did bring some leftovers into our room that got a little smelly (before we realized there wasn't a fridge) and my husband took the bag of food (from Frontera, so sad we couldn't keep it!!!) to the concierge and explained he wanted to throw it away. The guy gave my husband directions to the dumpster out back!!! OMG. Even a Ramada concierge would say, ""Oh, let me take that for you sir."" So, anyhow, if you're looking for a place to sleep, take a hot shower, and have zero expectations beyond a clean, safe place to sleep, this is your spot. It is withing walking distance of a LOT of awesome stuff. But PLEASE go find a deal somewhere on line!! If you're looking for romance, indulgence, pampering: run away!",2
29,"So get this yelpers....I had the WORSE flying experience this past October(09) from SFO to Ohare...I'll yelp that botchjob in a sec, but anywhoo, I called the hotel after landing and mentioned that I was just making sure all was well, due to EVERYTHING ELSE going wrong that day. And when I get to the Tremont, ya wanna know what happened? "" You sounded so stressed out on the phone earlier we upgraded your room"" Pimp. Nice. I didn't even know they had rooms that large..and they got Ditka's to take our order at closing, and the hotel delivered our food to our door.In fact they pretty much spoiled us our whole visit(they even played gatekeeper for an annoying relative of mine..we of course tipped them for it) I love these bitches.See you in october 2010!",4
30,"For the money.. it was a great hotel. Clean, great location, comfortable and fabulous staff. I enjoy older hotels with character.. The Tremont fit the bill. Great views, There weren't an abundance of tv channels, but the picture was clear and I sure didn't travel to Chicago to stay in the room and watch tv. and would prefer not to pay higher rates so others can. I would so stay here again. I wish I could remember the desk clerks name .. she was awesome in answering questions about the area.",3
31,"I agree that this place is pretty small, but in the city it's hard to find a place this cheap that isn't. The value is huge with this place. It's in a great place, standard high-er end rooms, and above all pretty quiet. We stayed Halloween weekend and had no issues with hearing people in the hallway/people hearing us. The crowd seemed to be mixed, some young some older so I was little worried about noise level, but nothing happened (which is more than I can say for some of my other hotel visits). I mostly interacted with the night guy. He was great. Really knew a lot about the hotel/area and he was very friendly- even went out of his way to find me a lighter :) The biggest downside was really just that they never asked if we needed more than one key, so at a few points in time I got locked out of the room and had to call someone to let me back in... but that was pretty minor :) Can't wait to stay again!",4
32,"My fiance and I vacationed to Chicago for 5 days & 4 nights; he picked The Tremont. At first, I was confused on the hotel: do I like it or hate it? The lobby is old fashioned in the sense with beautifully decorated with wooden crown moldings and leather sofa's. The receptionist didn't acknowledge us when we entered or exited, however, they were very attentive when I needed something. (IE: I wanted more towels & i got them in less than 5 minutes). The room was average, but very clean. At first, I was annoyed at how different the room looked in comparison to the photos, but my fiance made me change my mind: were we there to stay in a room the whole day or were we in Chicago to sight see? He was right: who cares? The best part: it was cheap ($85 a night) and walking distance to SO MANY attractions: a block away from million mile, short walk to the beach/Lake Michigan, 2 blocks from the Chicago Trolley, short walk to several bars and restaurants, to name a few. They also allowed me to receive and send faxes for free! For the price other hotels were charging, I would definately recommend this place!",4
33,"Realy small hotel but it's in a great location in downtown chicago. The rooms itself are pretty well maintained. The lobby is fairly nice. Elevators are small, I don't know if that's the theme they are going for, cozy.... The price isn't that expensive considering you are in downtown chicago. A decent room with an okay view ran me up about a little over a hundred a night, though It's all about location location location. I almost never saw the staff other than check in and check out, maybe that's a good thing... I'd come back again if I'm ever in chicago.",3
34,"Great location for walking to any part of downtown Chicago you could want.  The hotel was old, but not in any way that caused any kind of problem.  The lobby was very nice; I understand it had recently been renovated.  The room and other areas were clean, the staff was friendly and helpful.  The water in the room was hot and had good pressure!  My only complaint was that the walls were a little thin, so I could hear my next door neighbor.  Luckily he seemed to be a Japanese business man who didn't do anything other than talk on the phone and watch TV, but a different neighbor could have been a different situation!  Overall, the hotel was a great value for the location, and very clean and comfortable.  I would stay there again!",4
35,"Excellent location right down the street from Michigan Ave and John Hancock building. Can't forget free wi-fi and breakfast. The hotel is old, and the elevator is a bit scary at times, but it really was a value and we would definitely stay here again.",4
36,"Great location for a good price. Book it directly on their website and get the AAA price for the best deal. Hotel has that old Chicago charm. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Bathroom appeared to have been updated in the past few years. 32"" flat screen in the lowest cost room. (single queen) Was able to connect my laptop to it and watch videos. Could tell that the woodwork in the rooms was old, probably the original. But it was still in good condition and fit the building. They have some kind of incense/oil going in the lobby and it might be on the strong side for some people, but it didn't bother me. Continental breakfast is available at the Mike Ditkas next door for $5 a person. It isn't anything special but what's there is decent. Overall it's a very nice hotel. I dont need much for amenities above a clean room and comfy bed and this hotel fit that perfect. Free wi-fi is an excellent bonus. For the money, it was the best deal in town if you dont need 5 star accomodations. One quick note, during my stay in March 2011 the building next door was being torn down so the construction crews were working early weekday mornings. I'd expect that a new hotel is being built and would take some time once the demo is complete.",4
37,"Paid $140 for a room on this past Thursday. It was a last resort after the Sofitel was booked up and most of my coworker were staying there so I needed to be close  bye. Boy did I get the shaft on this business trip. I normally stay at the Sofitel which is amazing but this hotel can't compare in any way except the location. The check bell hop was very nice but besides him, the staff was not very helpful and kind of rude. I was told nothing about the hotel when checking in. I was barely spoken too actually. The room looks ok when I walk in, it was clean but older looking. The nightmare came at 2:30 am when I heard the couple next door having a good time soo clearly I felt like they were in my room. The walls were soo thin and the doors had more than enough room on the bottom for sound to come through. At 5 am the same couple wakes me again as they are getting ready and leaving their room. I finally fall asleep again just to be woken up by the cleaning staff cleaning that room at 7 am and again it sounded like they were in my room. I will never stay here again.",2
38,"Location is AWESOME. It's across the street from Water Tower. If I was doing a girls night out, I would stay here! Yeah, the room we got was small. But this is an experience! It's a beautiful, historic hotel! The room design is different...artistic, some of my friends loved it! Some-hated it!",3
39,"40 minutes to check in ... Drafty windows which made the room damp on a very rainy day and the heat is shut off in the summer (It was 57 last night) The sink stopper was broken, the shower backed up. The elevator makes you feel as if you are being buried alive (if it is working) otherwise, you get to use the service elevator from the kitchen. Which smells awful! All for 300 bucks a night! There was a convention in town and am sure prices were raised accordingly. It's like camping in Goldcoast! Here's the best part - I asked the front desk agent to call me a cab ... She walked me to the front door and whistled and walked back inside ...",1
40,"Another Travelzoo deal at an awesome price of $99 per night.  The Tremont is located just a few blocks off the Magnificent Mile on Chestnut, right next to Ditka's.  The lobby is narrow and have some seating in cozy groups with little candy dishes scattered around.  My first impression upon checking in was that customer service is not their high suit. More to come on this in a moment. I get my key, some maps and a reminder about the free internet and breakfast in the morning served next door at Ditkas for $5 (free with my package but I pass so I can't speak to this).  I get up to my room and open the door.  The room itself is spacious for what it is.  There's a separate sink vanity and spacious closet and roomy bathroom with shower over tub.  The plumbing hardware was a bit off and needed a serious update because they were circa 1960s (think Edward Scissorhands ).  The bed was very firm and the fitted sheets were shallow on the corners so if you were making cupcakes, they'd totally flip off (see picture).  Another sign of this hotel's age was that the window coverings were old mini blinds.  And another pet peeve for me is the linens.  These were of inferior quality with a funky Motel 6-ish comforter/quilt and not a down comforter embraced in a high TC duvet.  Yes, I have been spoiled with my Calvin Klein linens. Back to the service...  Upon departure and asking for a copy of my statement for expense reimbursement, service was of 'eh quality.  The response I got was my stay was prepaid (i.e. ""I'm not going to waste my time printing one for you"").  I then explained I needed a copy anyway for reimbursement, then silence and no eye contact (i.e. ""I'm going to ignore your request"").  So, annoyed, I then walk out but oddly get my back yelled at in a very loud tone (i.e. ""Ma'am!"" ""Ma'am!!""), 3 times, until I make it out the front door, keep in mind, there are 2 other guests in the lobby watching this unfold..  Unprofessional methinks. Hmmm.... Overall, for the price and the fact that I only had to spend 7 hours in the room, it was good enough.",2
41,"For the love of God, whatever you do, DO NOT take room 307.  Suffice it to say that I would rather set my hair on fire than spend two minutes in that room.  Shudder!  After asking for another room, was pleased with what I got.  The decor is a bit ""Quacker Factory-ish"" ala dried floral wreath, plaid pillow shams, etc. but overall, the room was clean, the bed comfy and the housekeeper..the nicest person I have ever met in a hotel!!  The hotel is a bit older but you cannot beat the location.  Enjoy the room for what it is, a place to sleep whilst in Chicago.  Enjoy!",4
42,"Decent price for downtown Chicago over a weekend.  Our room contained a air system which only produces heat in the winter and cold in the summer, so if it's one of those 80 degree days in February or March, I suppose you're screwed.  Piano in the lobby needs tuning.  Lobby is adjacent (attached opening) to Mike Ditka's.  Bed excellent, TV above average, bathroom and cleanliness meet the standards.",2
43,"We celebrated our one year anniversary by going downtown Chicago, getting a hotel room, and going to dinner and having drinks. This hotel was by far the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at. The room was cold one second, and than unbearably hot the next. Everything was extremely old, and out of date. The bathtub was very dirty, and the carpet in the room looked like it hasn't been shampooed in over a century. I've stayed at motels that were better than this. The one star that I gave to this hotel is for it's location.",1
44,"Some rooms may reveal the building's age, but all was clean and working just fine. What makes this place special outside of the excellent location is the warm and helpful staff. Around the corner, the Westin's well equipped gym is at your disposal.",4
45,"If you want a reasonably priced, clean, non-chain downtown Chicago hotel that's close to the Gold Coast, Mag Mile, CTA, etc. and can live without trendy decor or practically any amenities, this is a good option. As others have said, the decor is outdated, but the antique-like furnishings do give this place character, and it's very clean. You can't beat location -- stores, restaurants, lakefront, etc., are all very walkable. With the exception of wi-fi and shampoo/handcream in the room, this place offered absolutely no amenities -- even the free continental breakfast they offered last time I was here is gone, and they charged me $3 to store my luggage for a couple hours after I checked out -- every other hotel I've ever been to does that for free. All in all, I wanted a reasonably priced, clean, convenient place to crash while I was in Chicago, so this was a great option, but on trips to Chicago where my company is paying or I want a little more comfort, this would not be at the top of my list.",3
46,"This hotel is OLD.  Peeling paint, slow creaky elevators, dirty/scuffed baseboards, and ancient light lamps, wallpaper, and decorations. In my room, the walls actually had pretty sizable holes in them under the headboard and desk.  The sheets were rough and I even felt the hard springs inside the mattress poking me a little as I tried to sleep. That said, the location is good (it's close to Michigan Ave and the Chicago Red Line stop), the price is cheap (even last minute), and housekeeping is phenomenal at keeping things immaculate, even if you don't leave your room until the afternoon. There was also free wifi, which improves pretty much any situation.",3
47,"Don't kid yourself, you're paying for location and not much else. Mind you, the staff was nice and attentive, but that's mostly because they know it's the only thing that they've got to cling to. The facilities are atrocious. ""Quaint,"" or ""charming,"" or ""has character,"" would apply if the rooms were small but well maintained and attended to, which they aren't. The shower had barely warm water and backed up such that I had water about 4 inches deep by the end of my short, cold, shower. The images shown of the hotel are of the, admittedly, nice lobby and the penthouse suite. The actual room we stayed in? Comparable to the YMCA room I stayed in while on spring break in New Orleans during college. If it were anywhere else besides 1 block off of Michigan Ave., the phrase ""seedy dive"" would spring to mind. I really don't want to waste anymore of my time on this place, so I'll stop now. PS, we got it through Hotwire and they claimed it to be a 3 star ""boutique."" Crazy.",1
48,"I arrived at the Tremont this past weekend for one night only. I was staying in Chi Town for 2 nights but due to a convention in town this was the only hotel that had availability for the night and for $155 for the night I was more than willing to stay since I was getting rooms around the area for the rate of $350 and up! Lets just say here you are only paying for location. I ve learned that the ""older"" hotels are just NOT MY THING. The hotel lobby is pretty and leads you to believe the rooms will be the same. The staff was meh and the room, oh God the room. The room was so outdated! We had a one bedroom but for whatever reason it was two rooms combined into one (score!). For just two people it was pretty spacious and with two bathrooms and two tv sets then I guess I cant complain, but really I have to! The room smells like your grandmothers house and with the fixtures to boot! The carpet stunk, the sheets were stiff, the fixtures were old and dusty and lastly the bathrooms were old and falling apart. One of the bathrooms showers had brown water coming out of the faucet for the first 2 min! Since I only stayed a night I guess it could have been worse...thank goodness. - I also wish I can write a review about Ditkas since its downstairs but it was packed the night I wanted to eat there so I guess that says something good!",2
49,"I have a fondness for older hotels that are a little down on their luck, so I ignored all the moaning around (on several sites) about the Tremont being . . so . . . so . . . OLD!  Yeah, well--my wallpaper is peeling too.  I found the Tremont to be very comfortable if a little overpriced (what downtown hotel isn't?)  From my twelfth floor room I had a lovely view of the Lake--or would have if that damn Hancock Building hadn't been in the way.  The Tremont is close to all the shopping on the Magnificent Mile, the Looking Glass Theater, Water Tower Place, the Hershey Store, Bistro 110--all the jostle and jump of the Water Tower neighborhood.  Even though the Tremont is no more than a block from all the activity, Chestnut is a peaceful enough street that my room was quiet at all times.  The Tremont staff seems polite and helpful; the bathroom seemed recently updated.  The Continental Breakfast ($5.00) was only okay, but it was a sufficient jump start on Saturday morning. I was very happy with my stay at the Tremont and would recommend it to anyone except the most persnickety Felix Ungers out there.",4
50,"Well this was an interesting place.  I went to Chicago for one night with a group of friends (six of us) and we found the Inn at Lincoln Park by chance.  Managed to book a room with two beds for just around $60 after fees, with a military discount.  The hotel is really quite charming in an old boutique sort of way, but it is by no means fancy or super clean.  Our room was very cool - used to be two rooms, so it had two walk-in closets and two full bathrooms.  Since we are young and were just looking for somewhere to sleep for one night, it worked really well.  I don't think I'd go back there with my family, though. Downside: I don't think they had cleaned the comforter OR sheets in a while.  There were some interesting stains on them and the wall.  We avoided these by using our own blankets and pillows. Perk: They have free breakfast downstairs every morning.  Pretty decent.  And they didn't seem to care that six of us were staying in one room.",3
51,"Well..... I don't know where to begin.... Do I start with the room with no blinds.... or maybe that the TV didn't work... OH I know... the fact that the A/C didn't work!   A/C not working... We rented 2 rooms for 2 nights...135/night during NATO weekend, so we werent expecting a whole lot and thats exactly what we got. Only in 50% of the rooms the A/C worked. it would go on for about an hour and then just hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm the rest of the night. We had corner rooms so there was plenty of light, 2 HUGE windows on 2 walls... the only problem was that 50% of the rooms didn't have freakin blinds!!!!! One of the walls faced West so, hello sun at 6:15am. Not a good thing when we were there for a bachelor party.   So being the lacrosse fan we are, we wanted to watch a little NCAA lax before heading out... only one problem, 50% of the 46 inch flat screens didn't work!   Couldnt find the "" Free High Speed"" WIFI. I will give credit where is it due... the bathroom was nice and large and the beds werent the worse I have slept on. The building was perfect placement for us.. close to Wrigleyville and Down Town. We brought all items to attention of the front desk... many a times it was ""its my first day sorry"" or ""I'll look into it"" with no result. When leaving we explained to them the issues again and we got ""wow your rate was only 135/night we are charging 250/night for this weekend, you should feel pretty lucky"" WTF who says that, fix the A/C!!!",2
52,"The card key never worked.  I even got an extra one from the front desk and it stopped working.   The room is big enough to stand up, turn around and thats it. big closet though, odd!  The bed felt like a combination of springs and plywood. I think I could've slept better on the floor.   The heating in the building is odd.  Its the old cast iron standing system which is controlled by a boiler int he basement.  Walking into the room it was probably upper 80's even leaving the window open didn't help much.  the knobs on the contraption didn't work.   Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT allow anyone to flush the toilet while you're in the shower.  I thought this was something of the past.  Oh wait, this place is in the past.  Well anyway, im pretty sure second degree burns will happen.  I was able to hit the shower head out of the way after the initial scalding. The location is ok, if you like a college town scenario, that college kids are screaming in the hallways between 2-4 am.   Thanks, but.... no thanks.",1
53,"I really liked the location and the building is super cute and rustic but that's about it as far as the positives go. Each and every single time my boyfriend and I left the room, we could not get back in using our keys. We know not to keep them near cell phones, etc. so something is amiss with their key/lock systems. It was quite annoying having to go all the way up our 4th floor room only to have to go back down to get another key, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm not exaggerating. Also, the furnace or whatever it was (sorry, I'm a FL girl so I have no idea what it's called)  seemed to work only when it wanted and it got extremely hot in the room at times. Each night we had to leave the the window open so the temperature was tolerable, but even opening the window didn't work very well.  After alerting the front desk to our issues, they simply shrugged it off and said it should be working. This place wasn't expensive, but I've stayed in equally inexpensive places and never had these issues.  I think I will pick somewhere else when staying in Lincoln Park.",2
54,"I won't go into details but basically employees at this hotel enforce policies in different ways. If one tells you something is okay to do, but the next person working disagrees....it will coat you the customer for there disorganization. When I asked if they expected me to check with every employee on how and which policies they enforced, they simply said yes. That is a burden no customer should bear and no customer should pay for employee disorganization.",1
55,"I actually got a room for $60, including fees, through the Priceline ""pick your price"" promotion. I was really nervous about staying here because the reviews were so mixed. When we arrived we were relieved because the lobby is a lot nicer than the photos show. The parking was $15 but that was okay because it's expensive to park anywhere in Chicago. The staff were very friendly and quick. We were in town for a show at The Vic which was a short 15 minute walk! We felt safe in the neighborhood and there is a lot to do in the area. We stayed in a room with one double bed. Our room ended up being on the 4th floor in the stairwell (418 to be exact). It was small but it was fine for the two of us. The bathroom was very clean but the door didn't open past the toilet! It wasn't an issue for us but we thought it was a little odd. The room itself was clean except for a few hairs on our pillow cases (luckily we had brought our own). The bed was not the best bed ever but I could fall asleep fairly quickly on it. We thought the art hanging above the bed could stand to be changed and the walls need to be painted or wallpapered or something. Unfortunately there were some other guests that felt the stairwell would be a great place to fight and make noise from about 2:00 am until 6:00am. They were literally 5 feet from our room door. We heard a lot of door slamming and stomping around. I know this isn't the hotels fault but IF YOU STAY HERE REQUEST A DIFFERENT ROOM! We maybe got 3 hours of sleep. The breakfast was nothing special. The bagels were really hard but it was free so we didn't complain. The free wi-fi is very slow and won't work with any apps on a tablet/touch pad, just an internet browser because you have to ""log in"" every time you want to access something. It's not really worth using but will get the job done if you really need it. They also offer free coffee and hot tea in the lobby 24/7. We thought that was nice, especially because we were walking in the cold. Overall for the deal we got and the location it was not bad at all. We'll probably stay here again but just request a room not in the stairwell.",3
56,"The whole family stayed here for 4 nights this summer as we moved youngest sister into DePaul. The rooms were clean and well kept during our stay. The building is super old so there's some interesting character to the layouts. The lobby is comfortable, and the complimentary breakfast was standard warm continental. The desk staff was friendly and had maps available for us to take with us when we ventured out to explore. Met my expectations for a budget hotel, nothing stellar but no complaints. The best part obviously is the super convenient location: an easy walk from the train station, an easy walk to the park, zoo, lots of restaurants and shops.",3
57,Great location but the hotel is super old and scary... like honestly I wouldn't walk around anywhere by myself. We recently stayed at the Conrad downtown for cheaper than here. PASS,2
58,"I had a good experience here, for the most part.  The building is old, and I liked that.  It had some character.  The room was clean and comfortable, the price was right, and the people were friendly and efficient.  A great location too.  As noted by other reviewers, the room was chilly.   BUT -- I was really put off by their blatant misrepresentation about wi-fi.  The web site says: ""Complimentary high speed wireless internet access."" I have posted a picture of the sign on the building that says ""Fast Free HSIA,"" which must stand for high speed internet access.   And IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.  When I checked in, the friendly desk clerk told me, standing not ten yards from that sign, that there was ""slow"" internet for free, but ""fast"" cost $6 an hour.  She said the ""slow internet was OK for checking e-mail, but that's about it.  She was right.  VERY slow.   It's not a big deal to me whether there is a charge for internet.  But it is a HUGE deal to me that the hotel flat-out misrepresents what you get for your money.  Very offensive.",2
59,"Oh man - where to start?  Well, I saw a funny review on Orbitz which expresses my sentiments perfectly, so here's an excerpt... ""The Inn at Lincoln Park is located in one of Chicago's trendiest neighborhood and yet, the hotel itself does not live up to ...  its surroundings. The comforter on the bed looked old and a bit worn and perhaps it was the combination of humidity that made me not want to take my shoes off... Oh, and I didn't feel comfortable sitting on the toilet seat without first covering it with toilet paper... When was the last time they cleaned that bathroom? On the plus side, I found the front desk staff to be very helpful and genuinely concerned about my comfort. It's in an EXCELLENT location and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. With that in mind, one night was enough for me."" So in summary: Pros: * location - lots of shops and food (the walgreens on the corner is closed right now though) * pleasant staff - very accommodating and helpful in my experience Cons: * the rooms - small, uncomfortable, and not clean I don't like to be too negative, so will leave it at that.  Keep in mind that you're paying half or a third of the cost of a nice hotel, so you get what you pay for.  If you've stayed in hostels through europe in your youth and can still stand it, this place is fine.  So I'd say this is the right place if all you care about is having a bed to sleep on and would spend as little time as possible inside the room.  I never realized I had become a hotel snob until I stayed here, so the Inn at Lincoln Park will always have a place in my heart.  Somewhere in the back/bottom...",1
60,"I joined Yelp tonight specifically to warn people away from this place.  I arrived at 10:30 in the evening, and by the time I was in the room for 30 minutes I had already made reservations at another place; 15 minutes later I was already walking to the new place with my bags.  I simply could not stay there.  Peeling wallpaper, chipped paint, mystery stains on the carpet, a truly frightening bedspread, ripped chair cushions, scratched-up upholstery, and a general sense of uncleanliness; but the clincher was the security chain, which had clearly been broken in numerous times before, given the EIGHT bruised nail holes clustered around it. They did offer to upgrade me, but I simply had to leave.  I am not a hotel snob, but that room just felt like a dirty motel at a truck stop.  If it was $40 / night [in this neighborhood], I could see it.  But over $100 / night?!?!  No f-ing way.  I went to the Day's Inn one block away for $13 / night cheaper...   I hate to be so negative, but they need to know they need to upgrade their facility; in the meantime, I can take some solace from helping others avoid the disappointment I felt.",1
61,"My wife and I stayed here on St. Pats weekend 2009.  The lobby area is nice but I started to get a feeling of doom as we went through the hallway and stepped in the tiny elevator.  I said to my wife, this hotel is small but quaint. Our room was exactly that, small but quaint.  I wasn't expecting huge or modern.  I was expecting current tech with nostalgia.  Our room was fitted with a CRT tv (old style SD tv)  and a small fridge (unstocked).  We had a radiator for heat, purple tile in the bathroom and an old tub with a shower curtain.   The location is excellent for exploring the Wrigleyville area.  Bus 22 will take you up and down Clark for $2 a trip.  (don't be scared of the bus). The Inn offered a nice breakfast included with the fare.  I thought the bed was comfortable and the room temp was fine.  I opened the window before going to sleep, but had to close it by 1AM due to the street noise. The price is a little high for the location, but in a pinch you will not be disappointed.  I will not be back unless the area is booked.",3
62,"I stayed here on my last visit to Chicago... all hotels were booked that weekend, so that was the last resort and my expectations were low. I paid much more than I should have for a place like this one (almost $200 a night), but I think their regular rates are quite a bit cheaper if you book your room in advance. This said, the hotel was actually not bad. It's nothing fancy: very similar to your average Days Inn or Best Western, but the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and the room was clean. We even got a free upgrade (larger room). They have free breakfast (kind of crappy, but it's free...), and there is discounted parking at the hotel: $12, which is very cheap by Chicago standards. So... I'd have no problem staying there again, provided I can get a cheaper rate. 3-1/2 stars.",3
63,"Nice location to stay at. Its close to everything -- plenty of restaurants, shopping places, the lake, the city, and Wrigley! Its a small place with good management.  Its not cheap and not so much because of the excellent amenities, but for the excellent location.",4
64,The great thing about this hotel is their free guest passes to the Bally's next door.  I put up some friends here (since my place can only hold maximum five comfortably) and they really enjoyed the convenience of everything and the staff was super friendly.,4
65,"If Yelp had negative stars then this business would get a -5. THIS PLACE IS A WORLD OF NO!!! Rooms are old and gross. Yes, clean sheets, but the beds feel like they are from the Salvation Army. The shower barely had hot water. Service is TERRIBLE. I had to walk down to the ""lobby"" to get an iron. And it's not like I got a discount. This place was not cheap the weekend I was there. Terrible, terrible, terrible. I WILL NEVER GO BACK.",1
66,I have stayed here many times. It is a fine place to stay however I cannot stay there anymore because THEY HAVE BEDBUGS. Don't do it. This was in January 2011. They may have fixed the problem. I don't know. ASK!,3
67,"If you like a hotel that you spend almost $200 to be comfortable DO NOT STAY HERE! Just stayed for one night Sept. 11. Most of the hotels in town were booked and we thought for $200 and discovering a new neighborhood for us in Lincoln par would be fun. I have never dreaded going back to a hotel to sleep for the night. Yes it's old, but apparently that also means dumpy. Postage stamp for an elevator, narrow dark hallways, and dark old rooms with an old TV and an outdated bathroom that really needs some bleach! Our room was a smoking (tried to save $10) and boy did it stink! Our air conditioner didn't actually cool very well, and made a funny noise ALL night. The only thing I felt was clean were the sheets and I was still thinking about the possibility of bed bugs.  The staff were not friendly, saw them give attitude to another guest who did not want to stay once he actually saw the rooms. Next time, stay at the Club Quarters in the loop for the same price.",1
68,"i was skeptical staying at this hotel but I thought I should give it a shot... BIG.. no .. HUGE mistake.. the room was ok but the paint at the wall was peeling.. the bathroom has ""curly"" hair.. someone had used the bathroom b4 i checked in and forgot to flush.. I had to inspect the bed for bed bugs ... too expensive and definitely not worth it.. the management was very nice, accomodating and placed a wake up call for me.. nice people .. the place appeared to be nice but turned out to be a disappointment.",1
69,"Aside from the slow elevators and slow internet  I enjoyed my stay here even though it was under crappy circumstances (displaced by fire in my apartment building). Luckily the owner of my apartment building (right up the street) owns this hotel so we got a free room for two nights and a few other perks I wont mention. I was surprised to find a room with two sinks in the bathroom and a small room with a fridge, microwave, sink and a coffee maker. The bathroom was better than the bathroom in my apartment and not at all with a generic hotel look. If I ever move away from Oak Park and come back needing a hotel, this is the place I will stay!",4
70,"Stayed in the motel part of the hotel, but attended a marriage ceremony and reception in the main building. The motel is a real throwback, with multiple versions of patterned wallpaper, bright colored bedspreads, and drapes all mixed in with a combination of carpet and contrasting tile. It's a good thing I could give a s**t about decorating. The bed was comfortable and clean, and overall, the place is very nicely kept. Bathroom is tight for two (really, it's tight for one), but a nice, hot shower. The accommodations for the marriage ceremony and reception were top notch, and everything from the bartenders to the hors d'ouevres were excellent. And the dinner was incredible -- not sure I've ever seen a kitchen send out this much food -- and complicated food (beef wellington), no less -- and have it come out hot, crispy and delicious. Kudos to all for being spot on! TIP: Don't forget to ask for the WiFi password when checking in -- and the WiFi password expires in the middle of the night, so don't waste too much time trying to figure out why your network connection is gone in the morning...",4
71,"I'd love to give this 2.5 stars if I could. I decided to come here because the overall reviews looked good and the price was great. (I was there for business, didn't want to stay at the airport and downtown Chicago didn't make sense) Its true it looks recently renovated, the lobby area is pretty ritzy looking, and the restaurant seemed to have a lot of business. I stayed in the motor inn section. The sheets & towels were worn & tired. The place just didn't look sparkling. There was a towel in the bathroom hung like maybe the maid had not seen it from the last guest. The tile was a bit scuffed. The bathroom could have used a fan, a new door, and a light in the shower. This will do since this is a business trip, but I kind of wish I were somewhere else... http://www.carletonhotel…",2
72,"A good neighborhood hotel.  El stop not far.  My small room was in the fun, kitschy motor inn.  The bathroom is super-cramped.  The walls are thin, which means I could hear the conversations of my next-door neighbor (which means they could hear mine).  Yet somehow I didn't mind these negatives.  Good access to other points of Chicagoland.   Don't come here looking for luxury.  But it's clean, safe, and quirky. There is a decent amount of free parking, too.",4
73,"We stayed at the Motel part of the Clarleton. This is a separate area not in the hotel. It had allot of + the price was under 100 bucks, was on a single floor close to the parking. The room was small but the decoration was very nice kind of 60's inspired. The town was within walking distance. Oak Park has allot of shops. (we went on the 4th almost all were closed that day). The green line train was a block away if you want to go downtown. Take a visit to the Frank Lloyd Wright former home and walk or drive to the dozen or so homes he built very cool.",5
74,"Remember in Home Alone, that concierge at the hotel who was a total crab and wanted to bust Macaulay Culkin's ass? I think his dopplegangler works the front desk at Carleton. We had a group # for our wedding guests, but somehow a handful of their reservations disappeared. Maybe it was user error or maybe it wasn't, but when working in a hotel, you need to just drop the 'tude and satisfy your paying customers. You don't act like you're doing us a favor by letting us stay at your crusty hotel. Anyhow, besides all that drama, the hotel was fine. The cleaning ladies I ran into were super sweet. The rooms were clean and spacious. Their choice of fabric patterns for the curtains were unfortunate. The entrance was really weird. What hotel doesn't have automatic doors? Getting your stuff into the hotel is like an obstacle course. First you push through two sets of doors (no button for handicapped people to access), then you have some steps to make it through. To get to the right wing, you have to go up some more steps before making it to an elevator. Someone didn't think this through very well.",3
75,"I really wanted to like / love this hotel BUT! It reminds me of one of those places that are trying to hard to be something that they will never be. We went here for brunch. The food was luke warm and not too tasty. The guy that they had fixing the omeletts didn't understand English (what part of the plan was that ? ) the server came only 1 time to bring us drinks and of course due to mothers day brunch, the Tip Added to her ticket was a whopping 20% gratuity when we didn't see her. For almost $200 for 4.. one 12 yrs of age..I think I will do as I always do, spend a little more and head to the Ritz Carlton or the Drake hotel..",1
76,"We picked this hotel for a weekend away from the city because we thought Oak Park would be a nice place to unwind. The lobby had an old-world charm that lent the hotel a boutique feel. We splurged on a hot tub suite, and the tub was indeed the highlight of the experience. The bathroom was huge and seems to have been recently remodeled. The rest of the suite was immaculate, the front desk staff attentive, and the wi-fi as high-speed as advertised. For those that might be directionally-challenged, this hotel is off the beaten path and a bit difficult to locate. It is within walking distance from downtown Oak Park, though, so it is very convenient for those who would prefer to leave their car and spend the weekend on foot. I think the Carleton would benefit from the services of an interior decorator for the rooms. Much of the furniture seemed very traditional mid-price hotel style and boring. Not nearly as classy as the lobby might suggest. That was a bit disappointing. We did enjoy our stay, though the hotel was not amazing enough for us to feel an urgent need to book a second stay.",3
77,"We picked this spot because it is the closest hotel to Forest Park.  We paid amost $200 a night and we did get a suite.  The suite was very large- but needs serious updating.  The carpets were gross, the wall paper was coming loose, the furnture looked like it had been in a Frat house.  Needless to say, the only reason we have chosen this place for a second time is due to it's location. I decided to ask the front desk manager if there were any remodels in the works.  She did explain that all of the rooms have been or are in the process of being re-modeled.  She also said that the suites were the last one scheduled for re-model.  So, my suggestion would be to make sure you request a re-modeled room.",3
78,"I got a room for my parents in the motel section of the Carleton and I was so pleased with the rooms! They are used to Holiday Inns but I wanted them closer to me in Oak Park. The rooms were cute, very Mad-Men-60's, but adorable! They were clean and nicely sized for a motel, they had a little kitchenette and a nice clean bathroom. I told my folks that if they didn't want to stay there, I would and they could have my apartment! They were very comfortable and pleased with the location, they said next time they come to town they will surely stay there!",4
79,"Stayed in the ""Motor Inn"" section of the hotel.  While the appointments were nice and everything was clean there were a few issues with the room, which should be addressed by the management.   First... the walls are like cardboard.  I could hear everything my neighbors were saying, even though they were speaking at normal level.  Fixing this would require sound insulation in the walls, during your next remodel. Second... there was a constant roaring sound coming from the bathroom vent, presumably from a fan.  While the noise might not be that noticeable during the day, at night when everything is quiet, it becomes very noticeable and very annoying.  Just get a new, quieter fan.  I've read other reviews that complained about this as well. Third... get firmer mattresses.  The mattress was a very cheap, weak mattress.  The kind that squishes down to about 30% of its initial height. This makes for a very uncomfortable night sleep and a sore back the next day. With the above changes, this hotel could go from being second rate, to a real first class establishment.",2
80,"I was born and raised in Oak Park, and my dad still lives there, so I had actually never been inside the Carleton until I booked a block of rooms there for out-of-town guests that attended my wedding in June of 2011. The Carleton is pretty sweet! It is old-fashioned without being run down. Our guests enjoyed staying there.  It's in a nice part of Oak Park, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby (as well as the Harlem Green Line and Metra stops- easy access to Chicago). I liked the variety of rooms (and prices) that were available for our guests to book.  My husband and I booked the hot tub suite for two nights before and after our wedding.  The hot tub was really nice and the room was perfect for all of the hair and makeup needs of my bridal party. The front desk staff was so nice and accommodating of us and all of our guests.  Everyone recognized me as ""the bride"" and was especially considerate of my needs throughout the weekend.  Their customer service made me feel special and very taken care of. We definitely brought the party back to Poor Phil's on Saturday following the wedding, and all of our guests had a blast.  Thank you to the Carleton for putting up with us. We had a great experience there during our wedding weekend, and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Oak Park!",5
81,"Perfect for a classy, understated event. Free parking, too. Sure helps when the host and hostess are the classy, driving force behind the event! (xoxoxoxo Lisa B and David!!)",5
82,"I stayed at the Motor Inn section for one night prior to an interview. Staff was very helpful, prompt, and had a good sense of humor.  There are two parts to the hotel - The Carleton and the Motor Inn sections.  The Motor Inn section was very old timey hotel and reminded me of the ones i've stayed in in northern Wisconsin. I could not find the thermostat in the room but that may be because I'm an idiot... the room was a comfortable temperature anyway so it didn't matter to me. Internet is free but for some reason it didn't work at all.  I had to use the internet at an attached restaurant (also free).  I couldn't pull up directions the next day because they were both down and it was really frustrating. I don't really know what else to say about the place.  There was a big bed, a TV with cable (thank you espnews!) to keep me company.  There was enough soap that I could have showered 183 times and not made a dent in it.  Very spacious room.  Parking was easy (I came back after 11pm and still had a spot).",3
83,"Deciding to have my wedding at the Carleton was one of the first decisions I made after getting engaged, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made over a year and a half of planning! We held our ceremony and reception at the hotel, since we had a decent number of out-of-town guests and I didn't want them to have to deal with driving.  (And how awesome is it to be able to party all night and then just be a short elevator ride away from your room?)  I know I'm a little bit biased, but my wedding was BEAUTIFUL.  Everything turned out better than I ever could have hoped for.  My vision for my wedding day was executed exactly; how many brides can say that? Annie Mammoser is the wedding coordinator at the hotel, and whatever they're paying her, I'm sure it's not enough, because she is amazing.  Anything I wanted or needed, she was on it.  She made sure all the little details were seen to........ I did not spend a single second worrying about anything on my wedding day.  Even everything leading up to that (the tasting, meeting with linen rental vendor, multiple walk-throughs with my florist) was stress-free. The space is really beautiful (love the chandelier and the bar area), and it's nice to have it all to yourself (rather than being one of several weddings at a larger hotel or banquet hall).  We took some beautiful pictures in front of the Marion Street entrance, and all the extra seating area made for a really fabulous cocktail hour.  (The only thing I'm kind of bummed out about now is that I didn't get to have any of the awesome hors d'oeuvres we selected since I was so busy taking pictures and saying hi to everyone.) As far as cost goes - totally a bargain!  102 people for dinner, copious amounts of alcohol and hours of dancing cost us less than $10,000.  Try doing that in downtown Chicago.  (Not to mention the two complimentary nights in a suite that we were given.  The room was amazing, and it was really nice to be comped like that.) I've now been married for a month, and my friends and family are still talking about the food (really, really delicious!), the candy buffet (set up by Annie, perfectly!), and how much fun they had (possibly due to 5 hours of open bar).  A perfect setting for one of the best days of my life (so far).",5
84,"Beautiful ballroom and bar area. Great ambiance. We had about 65 people at our wedding reception and suprisingly the ballroom wasn't too big, however, since the bar area is down a little corridor, people pretty much ventured to the bar to drink and lounge after dinner/dancing. It was intimate, people we're able to meet and talk.  Since we had a small party, everyone could fit comfortably into the large bar area. The food was from Philanders and it was awesome across the board- the fav main dish was the beef and tilapia. YUMMY! We received a complimentary room which worked out well, we used it as our home base. It was close to the reception area and was very well kept with a old fashioned flair. I'm very happy with how the reception turned out, I think the hotel is great for smaller weddings and is a wonderful place if you want to get away from the typical Holiday Inn reception. Our course it comes with a price tag, but it was worth it! One more side note for wheelchair users: I was concerned since a couple of the guests are wheelchair-bound and the hotel reception area is actually on a couple levels. The hotel isn't accessible with ramps throughout, but they have lifts throughout to accomodate even larger electric wheelchairs. I was surprised the lifts were insulated very well because you couldn't hear the noise in the ballroom.",5
85,"I actually live real close to the Carleton but recently had a one night's stay the day before my wedding. I was lucky to stay in the hotel (instead of the motel section) which had a HUGE whirlpool tube. I would recommend staying at this hotel just to enjoy it. The staff was extremely helpful when my makeup artist needed a special chair to do makeup and they also were nice enough to let me stay a little after check out time. When I was in a rush at the last minute to leave, they checked me out without me having to wait. Thank you so much! The only down side: I left my bridal gown bag at the hotel (in fact I saw it but was in a rush to leave but didn't have time to go back). I called later that night but the maid service claimed nothing was found. The bag was pretty expensive, but I know it's my fault. My only recommendation is don't leave anything behind by accident.",4
86,"I worked at a wedding at the Carleton last week.  It is a gorgeous petite boutique hotel in downtown Oak Park.  The ballroom is perfect for a wedding between 100-150 guests.   For the cocktail hour, the hotel used a small banquet room as well as a bar with two small rooms right off of it.  The only thing that I disliked is that some guests were walking through the cocktail hour to get to their rooms on that side of the hotel.",4
87,"I'm surprised to see a review of the motor lodge that says the rooms have an ""old but clean look"". I'm not sure if the rooms have been redone recently or not, or if the motor lodge that others have reviewed is a totally different section. From my understanding, however, my friend did stay in the motor inn section. The room was pretty modern, with a flat screen TV, kitchenette, and a pretty nice bathroom when compared with your average motel-type rooms. We were both believing he would be staying in the main hotel, yet were both somewhat impressed by the room, which he described as ""artsy"". For the price, the room was great. I'm not sure if his price was lower because he placed his reservation online or not, but it was a pretty sweet deal. The room had two beds, a table with four chairs, a flat panel TV, a kitchenette with coffee maker and comp coffee, dishes, silverware, microwave, mini frig, and cabinets. The room had a little hallway which led to both the closet and bathroom. There's no dresser in the room, but a wall with drawers in the back of this little hall. The closet has more than ample space, plus two extra pillows, two extra blankets, iron, full sized ironing board, an extra roll of toilet tissue, and plenty of towels is the bathroom. The only ""bad"" thing was that I saw no ice machine anywhere. There was however a soda machine outside. The beds were fairly comfortable as far as motel beds go, and he had no problems with anything in the room, aside from the wifi being slow. Everything worked, the front desk staff was incredibly helpful, and everything was just great. I've stayed in a few motels, as well has motels pretending to be hotels, and this is by far my favorite. The next time I want to just get away for the weekend, it's nice to know that I don't have to leave the state or even Oak Park, to find a nice, relaxing hotel at a fair price for a night or two.",5
88,"We booked a block of rooms for our wedding this July at the Carleton.  The hotel was very pretty and our room was spacious and had lots of character.  Dana, who I worked with to book the rooms, was very helpful and returned my calls promptly.  The best part was that by 10 of our guests booking their rooms at the Carleton, we got our room free!   The only reason I didn't rate this a five is because I felt that the rooms are overpriced for the service, location and what the hotel can offer.",4
89,I had my wedding ceremony and reception at this hotel. The day was perfect. The banquet manager Annie is amazing! I felt very comfortable with her from the start. She is very organized and professional. She is extremely nice and very caring. She made sure my day was perfect. I'm so  glad I had my wedding at this hotel!,5
90,"We had a teeny little dinner (18 people) here the night before the boy's Bar Mitzvah, and some of our guests stayed here.  A lovely hotel with gracious service.  You won't get a pool and fitness center, but the location and charm more than make up for it.  Dana and Annelise gave our small-scale event the same attention and service that they'd give to a 200-person wedding.  The food was was tasty, though not very inventive. The thing is, that you won't get away cheap.  There are room charges on top of the food charges, which is why we had the main event at Maggiano's.",4
91,"The location met our needs, and the hotel staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.  However, there were certain negative aspects that could not be fixed by a simple call to the front desk.  At this price point, you do not get what you pay for.  If we're simply talking about the quality of the rooms, I would say $75/night, $80 tops.  Certainly not $188.   Overall, the biggest concerns were the rooms' smell, and the rooms' cleanliness.  Even though it is a non-smoking hotel, the first room I was given was stuffy and smelled of smoke.  It reminded me of an old room in a B&B that is rarely used.  I get the impression that lots of weddings happen at this hotel, so I think people party in the rooms, and staff does not necessarily enforce the non-smoking policy.  One of the restaurants in the lobby is fairly new, and management did not adequately consider how the hotel's layout and air flow (or lack thereof) might let the smell of the restaurant linger in the elevators and the hallways of the upper floors.  There is radiator heat in the rooms, which is fine.  There are also wall air conditioner units, but there are no instructions- just a remote- and it took some time to dicifer.   The rooms just look dingey. The comforters are pilling due to wear,  blankets old.  The pillows had yellow stains.  Furnishings look somewhat grungey on the surface, as though they haven't been wiped down properly.  The wallpaper and sofa had white stains.  The bathroom had mildew.   When the first room I had smelled of smoke (I have a severe smoke allergy), to the hotel's credit, I was (very nicely) given a second room without question.  While the smell of smoke in the second room was less, the room was no cleaner.  Both rooms hadn't been vacuumed well, and there was grit and dirt in the carpet.   In addition, a previous guest had spilled coffee grounds in one area, and no one had cleaned it up. I understand that due to the age of the building, that most funds must be put into the exterior, and keeping it up to code.  That being, said, for the money you are paying, I think the owners should seriously consider addressing some of these problems.",2
92,"We stayed in the motor lodge for work and those rooms are just so so, kind of an old look but clean. The resturant Barklays is pretty nice, the food is good, but the female server wasn't all that friendly.",3
93,"I had my wedding here, have had my family stay here on several occasions. Best value. Best Location. Trains to the city are a block a way. (but why would you leave Oak Park?) everything in walking distance... even the motel rooms are MOD, and fab, (recently updated) Restaurants are wonderful too. You will enjoy the locals at Poor Phils, Ask for the beer of the day.  I would totally recommend this hotel for weddings. Easy access, walk around abilty, and top notch everything. John Mahoney from Frasier even came to my reception- well, he was in the bar for the after party!",5
94,"We had both our wedding ceremony and reception at the Carleton in May 2011.  It was the first vendor we booked, and we have absolutely no regrets. Annie, the banquet manager, is organized, professional, and always quick to respond to any emails or questions. I found their policies regarding weddings much more flexible than other places.  The hotel itself is beautiful and provides an entire section for your wedding, including a gorgeous bar area with sitting rooms for cocktail hour.   The ballroom is a smaller and more intimate than many hotel ballrooms which I preferred for our 100 person wedding.  In addition, the prices and catering minimums are much more reasonable than any place I looked at in Chicago.   The food is catered by Barclays located in the hotel and was delicious, and we received many compliments on it and the hotel as a whole.",5
95,I love this hotel. My fiance and I had our engagement party here and everyone loved the food and the atmosphere.  The food is excellent and the service is great. The outdoor seating at Poor Phil's is lovely in the summer. We often ride our bikes here and sit outside for lunch when the weather is nice. We have stayed in their suites a couple of times and love their oversized jacuzzi tub.,5
96,"Classic location for smaller wedding/event with multiple rooms for different activities if you like to sit and talk away from main action.  The neighborhood is quiet and a nice choice if you want to be a little out of the city, but still close enough.   The staff is always courteous and helpful. A classic gem in Oak Park.",5
97,"I had my wedding (ceremony and reception) at The Carleton in Sept, 2009. The whole day was perfect - mainly thanks to Anne Mammoser Parker's hard work! Our wedding was the second of the day, and Anne got her team to turn the place around (and make it sparkle) in no time flat. The ceremony set-up was perfect, and the turn-around for a 165-person dinner happened like clockwork. Working with Anne during the preparations was a piece of cake, too. She was always available for a meeting or a phone call, and responded to emails immediately. Taking us through the tastings, to making suggestions about layout, Anne definitely listened to what we wanted and produced just that for the wedding. The hotel ballroom-area is beautiful. I received compliments all night about how amazing the hotel is, and what a fantastic venue it is for a wedding. The decor is perfect, and the size is just right. It's as formal or informal as you want it to be. The bar and two adjoining rooms are romantic and cozy, and perfect for quiet conversations and cushy seating. The hotel rooms are fabulous, too. We stayed in a room that was absolutely perfect. It was right up the stairs from the bar, and it had everything we wanted. The bathrooms are very ornate and updated, and the decor in the rooms is really unique. Truly a fantastic place for a wedding and other events! Anne is perfect to work with!",5
98,"My wedding has happened.  It happened at the Carleton and it was fantastic.  The most fantastic wedding I have ever been to; I am so proud to say it was mine.  Annie Parker, special events coordinator extraordinaire, oversaw this event with care and love and attention to every detail - as if it were her own.  Annie and I have gotten to know each other pretty well over the past year or so.  I have emailed her daily for weeks at a time with silly questions and requests and advice and she has always responded with clear, thorough responses and always with our best interest in mind. The staff at The Carleton deserve some recognition.  I had quite the crowd -- the most bottles  ever consumed at one event.  Yup, that's us!  We had a few scenarios that would've thrown the average banquet staff off their game, but not this one!  I can't say enough about the conscientious effort to make my wedding the best it can possibly be.  The food was amazing -- we had chosen honey mustard crusted chicken, rib eye and salmon.  All deserving high marks. All the guests that made mention of the food were pleasantly surprised with the quality AND quantity of these dishes.  The rib eye was the most consumed entree and this piece of meat was something to be expected at a high end steak house.  Very nice.  Our room was beautiful, clean and large.  We had 12 other guests booked at the hotel and all were pleased as well.  Poor Phil's is the bar and grill which I have reviewed in the past, but will mention that they serve a great breakfast!  Several guests enjoyed the morning after here.",5
99,"I cannot say enough good things about Anne Parker and the Carleton Hotel. We had our wedding there last weekend, and all the guests stayed there as well. Anne did an amazing job with planning our ceremony and cocktail hour!  She was so professional and knowledgeable. From the first day we met, I knew I was working with the right person. Anne is amazingly good at what she does, and takes all of the tasks related to wedding planning very seriously. So much so, it helped me to be at ease knowing she had the details under control. I could not have been happier with Anne and the venue as a whole. Their beautiful vintage bar was perfect for our cocktail reception and photos. Additionally, I heard nothing but good things from guests about the hotel itself. I stayed there the night before the wedding and can attest to how nice the rooms are. The Carleton was the perfect venue for our wedding! Thank you Anne,and the Carleton Hotel, for exceeding every expectation!",5
100,"Hmm. I have to say quite a pleasant experience! We changed hotels after reading the positive reviews of this one. Stayed for a few days. Very nice front desk staff during morning and late evening hours. This was more like a smaller boutique hotel in a GREAT area, Wabash and Erie, 2 blocks or less from everything including Michigan Avenue. Safe, clean, well landscaped lush area. Property also clean, well maintained and fresh smelling. Sure, rooms are small but why would you stay in your room in this great city. I didn't find them terribly small. There was a small hallway that went past the bathroom to an area with a desk, queen bed and flat screen. Modern decor and colors. Small dresser in closet with ironing board and safe. Bathroom larger than I expected after reading the other reviews. FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had yogurt, cereal, hot cinnamon rolls, an egg product, sausage, etc. Hot beverages were always available throughout the day. Clean dining area just off lobby. Clean, comfortable beds, updated fixtures, comfy bed, clean, bright linens. I did not have too many issues with noise overall. Good water pressure, hot water, clean towels. Partial view of street, room not totally blocked in. Again, you're not here to look out the window. You are here to eat and shop. (Don't kid yourself). You don't need a car here in the city so save your efforts with that. Close to trains, buses, etc. Easy walkable city. Trader Joe's is across the street, Grand Lux, Bloomingdale's Home, Dues Pizza around corner, Michigan Avenue two blocks away, quick walk. All the restaurants/shops any visitor would want. Save yourself the bloated overhead of some of the other more crowded Magnificent Mile hotels and stay here. Nothing bugs me more when the common areas, lobbies, etc. are just crammed with tourists. Good for single travelers, families, etc. Good for YOU!",4
101,"Location is excellent.  Right near the Magnificent Mile and Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due.  There's even a Starbucks and a Trader Joe's across the street. Rooms are small.  Beds are small, more like a Full rather than a Queen.  Bathrooms are small and smelled kinda weird.  Walls are thin. Breakfast was pretty awful.  No waffle bar. Price is kinda expensive but location is great!",3
102,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights while visiting Chicago. The hotel in on Wabash and Erie, two blocks from Michigan Avenue (known for shopping) and the CTA Redline. The hotel is around a busy and safe area. I walked around the area at 11pm at night and I had no issues. There were not a lot of people out at night but I felt safer than other parts of Chicago I visited during the daytime (southside of chicago). They have a friendly front desk who will answer your questions and accomodate your needs (extra soap, problems with the room). The rooms are small but that is fine because when you visit chicago, you are only at your hotel to sleep for a few hours. The bathroom is about the size of your room. They have FREE WiFi and breakfast buffet which had eggs with cheese, sausages, make your own pancakes, cereal, fruit and etc. Hot coffee and teas as well as ice cold water were always available throughout the day. They have a nice, clean, big dining room by the lobby. I like the hotel. The only problem is the ventiliation kept making a sound at night and kept waking me up. I asked the hotel staff to fix it two nights in a row. It stopped for a few hours and the sound came back again. I would definitely go back to this hotel again as it is convenient and not too expensive.",3
103,"THe rooms are nice with a retro feel, kinda small but that didn't matter to much it was just a place to sleep. I was upset that the maid didn't do a cleaning on the third night we were there.  In addition, upon checkout the staff did not say a word. He just asked my room number and said bye. A small "" how was your stay would have been nice."" Although, I admit the service men that helped with luggage and taxi were very welcoming and they actual asked how the stay was. The location is the best part of this hotel .",3
104,"I'm no frills, so this was easily likable for me. About $80 w tax/service charge on http://hotels.com. I got a queen accessible, I think. Cheapest place I found that was 3 stars, no bed bug reports (as of Jan '12 - no bug reports is always something I check now with travelling!) and near Magnificent Mile, so it was excellent.  Expected smaller but upon getting to the room, I was happy. totally enough room to move around. A cute lil mini-sofa seat in the corner. Chic wallpaper in the bathroom. Not a place you'd come to for luxury or for the style, it's draw is that it covers the basics and has lil contemporary charm touches (love the chicken photos in the foyer)..Friendly front desk. The doors are pretty industrial looking metal and closet appears to be a janitor's closet before opening, but whatever, there's hangers and a small safe and that meets the needs. You can see some ppl also reviewed under Hotel Cass (formerly)  - http://www.yelp.com/biz/…. Happy face =] because: - Low price - Adequate enough size for basic needs - Great location - Free internet wifi, and decent speed - 2 comps in the business ctr with free printing - Free breakfast (not perfect but free is key - and  Trader Joes and Jewel Osco are nearby to cover more options). Bfast is like 6-930, so I had to force myself awake to get it, but glad it was there. - Clean enough (a couple markings on the slightly dusty curtains and I think some stain on the wallpaper, but oh well) - My bf was happy that the flat screen TV had HBO - Good view outside the room to see the tops of some churches Improvements would be: - I wish there was a mini fridge (it was 23 degrees when I visited, so I put water near the window and that worked OK). - I wish there was a microwave (tho there is one downstairs in the breakfast room - I wish there was a luggage rack (eh,I put luggage on the sofa) - Not much bathroom counter space (I just cleared the towels off the top towel rack to put a few things there or I could have brought the mini white table over next to the door if needed) - Thicker walls (one night was quiet, the next morn had neighbor moans - ah well, it's just one of those amusing touches when you stay at a hotel haha) I would def stay again and recommend to others.",4
105,This is the old Cass Hotel...Which is originally why I started staying there on my weekend trips to Chicago. Call me vain :) The staff are always friendly and the rooms are clean. They do a great job with their loungey area and the decor is very mod. It's totally centrally located right off of Michigan and in the heart of all the shopping (If that's important to you). The rooms are teensy-weensy so do not be surprised. The walls are a little thin too as it's a very old building.  It always ends up being one of the cheapest stays which has kept me coming back...Even though they ditched my namesake.,4
106,"My boyfriend and I stayed here last Saturday while attending a nearby wedding and Holiday Inn Express far exceeded our expectations (considering it's very fairly priced in this highly desirable area). Pros: - Extremely friendly & helpful staff. Checked us in when we arrived at 10:30am. - Free continental breakfast. Good bagels, eggs, danishes. Free coffee all day, actually tastes good. - Free wifi + 2 public access computers. - Very modern and clean decor. Room was clean. - Location! 5 min walk to Red line. 15 min walk to Blue line (to O'Hare). 2.5 blocks from shopping on Michigan ave. 1 block to Trader Joes! Cons: - TEENY TINY ROOM. But it's no biggie if you're not planning to spend much time there. - .... that's it.",5
107,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in June 2011. If you are looking for huge space and luxurious amenities, this hotel is not for you. If you have kids, this hotel is not for you. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower, this is for you. Great location and great value. Short walk to CTA red line and within walking distance to many fun bars, restaurants, shops, and the lakefront. There were a few small problems: our intial room lacked air conditioning, so we were transferred to a second floor room that was probably arranged for handicapped persons so there was an open shower, no fan, etc. I am sure the free breakfast was great, bit we never awoke early enough to enjoy it! I would definitely stay here again!",4
108,"Tiny rooms, no fridges in rooms.  Got a staph infection there, that has been a problem off and on for a year now.  No contact from hotel even though I tried twice to contact them about the issue.   Too bad since I travel a decent amount for work and now avoid Holiday Inns'. Nothing here was better than any other similarly priced hotel, no in room fridge and tiny rooms would have already dragged this to a 3.  Staph infection and no communication makes it a 1.",1
109,"Will definitely stay here again ! One of the cleanest holiday inn hotels I have ever stayed in! These employees I encountered had wonderful customer service and personality ! Always a plus! I didn't feel like I was staying in a chain hotel when I checked in. They gave me all info I needed at check in. Some hotels i have to call the front desk when I get to my room because they didn't give me the wireless internet access. I booked a 2double bed room.. Rooms are on the small side, but that is because the building was built in the 1930s hence the small rooms compared to other hotels. Loved my room.  Bed was comfortable and warm in the Chicago winter. The window does have a bit of a cold draft, but with the heater on 75 at night and under the blankets I was super warm. Bathrooms. The cleanest bathroom I felt comfortable putting my bare tush on the toilet, and my bare feet in the tub. The shower tub had a mat on the tub floor which means they can remove it and sanitize for the next person ! I love how cute and chic the whole hotel felt. I will definitely stay here again, I'm looking forward to it. Con Jus checked out. Valet parking took forever to bring the car around ! We called before we left the room, checked out, and waited. And waited like fifteen minutes. It took valet a total of half hour to bring the car around. Valet ls $40. Self park at the same garage for overnight is $39. Next time id rather save a dollar +tip and park my own Damn car. Valet was not economically savvy after waiting forever to get my car it was not rush hour. The time I waited I could have gotten my own car and loaded up my luggage and been on my way to my flight !! The valet guy was not even apologetic for taking Soo long. The valet Is not apart of hi express its a different company but make it clear u would rather park your own car then deal with that shit. I'm on vacation. I want to enjoy what little time I have instead kg waiting around !",5
110,"This was my very first trip away from home with my two-year-old son.  The pictures online, convenient location and cheaper price if you book in advance were all positives even before we arrived.  We had a rough taxi ride from the airport, and just upon arrival, my son vomited in the taxi....not the best start to our trip.  The gentleman at the front desk (I think his name was Todd) was sympathetic and very kind.  We were hours early for check-in, but were able to take advantage of the lobby and breakfast, and we cleaned up the best we could in the lobby washroom.  Todd and another woman at the front desk were helpful with directions to nearby attractions.  Our room was ready after a few hours exploring the city, which worked out nicely (still earlier than check in time).  The room  was exactly as pictured on the website.  Small, but not too small (still had a dresser inside the closet and closet space), updated, modern and very clean.  As a mother, these were all very important to me.  Wi-fi was free, which was appreciated.  We had a very pleasant stay and enjoyed breakfast everyday.  Some days it was very busy, but we were lucky enough to have a table each day.  The staff (including breakfast staff) was incredibly friendly and courteous!  That alone would bring us back for another stay.  Todd remembered my name after our first encounter and every doorman would greet my son and me enthusiastically every time!  There are a few steps at the entrance from the front door to the hotel lobby, which worried me with an enormous suitcase and a stroller, but the doorman would help us every single time.   They held our luggage both the day we arrived and the day we left, which was a relief.  There is a Trader Joe's practically right across the street, and restaurants, Magnificent Mile shopping and Water Tower shopping all within walking distance.  Navy Pier is a longer walk, but manageable.  I liked that the hotel seemed smaller and personal, was updated and still was an historical building.  We would absolutely stay here again!  I am grateful for such a positive traveling experience!",4
111,"Holiday Inn Express is an affordable good enough hotel. I found a deal online and booked this hotel for around $75 a night which is pretty cheap for downtown Chicago. The lobby and the common area are nice. The room is VERY small, but it has a comfortable bed. For me, when you're in downtown Chicago, you're not going to spend a lot of time in your room anyway. They have free wifi which is nice. Their free hot breakfast was also decent too. The rooms are nothing to brag about, but the location and price give this property a 4 star.",4
112,"This Holiday Inn Express used to be the Hotel Cass. My friend and I are currently staying here for Lollapalooza and so far our experience has been great. We arrived at around 10:30pm CT on Thursday due to delayed and re routed flights but no biggie. When we got here the concierge already knew my name and was waiting for our arrival. We were upgraded to a King suite. Rooms are nice, clean and modern. Small in size but they remind me of hotel rooms in Europe. I like that. Free breakfast every morning with, eggs, sausage or bacon, cereal, fruit and cinnabuns. Yum. Free high speed wifi with an excellent connection and a business center. Super comfy beds. Lots of pillows labeled soft and firm. Sleeping here is dreamy. Right across the street from Trader Joes and loads of yummy restaurants. We got a great deal on this hotel because we booked months in advance. If you're planning to come to visit Chicago, this is a great and affordable place to stay.",4
113,"Rooms are VERY SMALL! Not a criticism, just a fact. Our room was approximately 10 X 12 with a view of a brick wall about 3 feet from the window. However: great price for the great location, wonderful bed, big screen TV, free WiFi, AC, breakfast included. Terrific staff. If you just need a comfortable, clean place to sleep and shower this works great.",4
114,my family and i stayed at this hotel one night before a bulls game. the service was great. the check-in was quick and easy. the rooms were clean...the beds are the most comfortable beds i think i have ever slept in. we had a great view of the city. it was also the freshest cleaned smelling room (if that makes sense) i have ever had. i would definitely stay here again if i am ever back in the city.,4
115,"Stayed here via Hotwire for $79 on a Saturday night. We arrived around 9pm and the staff at the front desk was extremely rude. The redheaded woman that checked us in never made eye contact once and didn't bother listening to us either. We were given a room on the 2nd floor at the end of the hall.The rooms are very small and the hallways are equally as small. Our room faced Wabash so there wasn't much we could do about the noise. I would hope higher floors didn't have as much of an issue with noise. Upon checkout the in-room service was not functioning. We called the front desk and the staff was just as rude as the evening staff and abrubtly hung up on us. The only saving grace to the hotel was the breakfast in the morning. All in all - we got what we paid for with a location we wanted. NOTE: Parking at the hotel is $40 valet, you can go around the corner and use public parking for $34 for overnight.",1
116,"Excellent location!! Hotel was clean and pleasant. Rooms are very small, but ours was fine for 2 people. Had we brought our baby, however, we would not even have had enough floor space to set up a pack and play. Starbucks and Trader Joes are across the street. Although hotel parking is not a great deal, there is an outdoor lot nearby that charges only $25 for overnight parking. Overall great stay!",4
117,"Perfect place to stay in downtown Chicago. Just stayed here for 3 nights this past weekend and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Being my first time ever staying in a Holiday Inn, I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, but we were greeted with genuinely friendly staff who were more than happy to hold our luggage (we arrived earlier than check in time) and suggest things for us to do and places to eat while we waited for our room to be cleaned. Free hot breakfast in the morning was better than the usual continental breakfast they offer at other hotels..complete with cereal, eggs filled with cheese, pancakes, bagels, sausage, muffins, biscuits, assorted juices, and hot cinnamon rolls (although we didn't take advantage of this every morning since Chicago has so many yummy breakfast spots). Staff were always available to hail cabs for us. One guy even went down the block to flag one down! Extra tip for him of course. Hotel is walking distance to some nightlife, restaurants, and shopping. If you get the GO Chicago card, the greyline will pick you up a few blocks from the hotel so you can save money on transportation there. Only complaints: small hallways and small rooms! Super cramped. But I guess for the location and price, you can't really expect much more.",4
118,"Rooms were decent but abit small.  Nice complimentary hot breakfast, free wifi, and coffee available throughout the day.  Self parking was $32 and no re-entry, which was inconvenient.  The other option is valet for $40.",3
119,"I stayed here with friends for a concert for two nights and have to say for the price, location and quality, the Whitehall Hotel is tough to beat! It markets itself as boutique hotel and it is indeed just that, so you can expect great 1:1 service but it's not going to be a systematic as your neighborhood Hilton. Maybe it's because I live in NY, but the room were much bigger than I anticipated and we had a great view of Chicago's Gold Coast. The beds were insanely comfortable and I found the bathroom to be clean (and also spacious). As I had last been to Chicago when I was a kid, I wasn't too familiar with what to do but found everyone at the front desk and concierge to be very helpful in recommending places to go visit/eat. I was initially unsure on how near/far the hotel was relative to other things in Chicago but quickly found its location to be very ideal. It's right off Michigan Ave so you have all the shopping/Maginificent Mile right there and only a few blocks away from the water. In fact, the only time we used a cab was to get to/from the airport and then coming back from going out at night. They do not have an ice machine on each floor so you have to call the front desk to order some which is fine with me but when we did call, we had to do so twice before it finally came up. A light bulb was out in our room and we also had to call twice before someone came. I am not sure if getting to the ice machine/mechanic just took that much time but that was only some significant ""complaint"" I had. Also, the TV was severaly outdated (think late 90's) and was angled to the left of our bed (opposed to in front) which was a little strange. Overall, an excellent hotel - highly recommend.",4
120,"For the price I have to give a solid three stars. The place was under construction and the air conditioning was off in the lobby for the three days I was there. they could have made arrangements considering the temperature was over 95 and humid every day. Also, the doormen were very inconsistent, usually hanging out at the curb chatting up the valet attendant. The rooms were nice and clean, beds comfortable and the aire in the room blew ice cold. All in all, I would stay here again as long as I was able to get the reduced rate with AMEX. If you are looking for a hotel with dining, this place has a restaurant but it remained empty my whole stay. (But hey, this is Chicago and I am sure no one wants to eat at a hotel restaurant unless it is associated with a kick ass chef!)",3
121,"First off, this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel.  Not a chance, more like a 2 1/2 star.  We had to wait about 15 minutes to check in as there was one person working the front desk who was on the phone, this was at 2:45pm, check in is 3pm so we were a little early but I think you would have more staff on since it was a Friday.  But we got checked in and headed to the elevator, two of us fit with our one suitcase each, barely.  Not a big deal.   We get to the room and our room keys don't work.  Ok it happens, the maid was able to let us in.  We went to the desk and got new keys, which also didn't work.  At this point we're irritated.  So we call the front desk, who seems to think that not having a working room key isn't a big deal.  Wow.  I was not about to rely on them to let me in and out of the room.  I did pay to stay here.  So the maintenance man comes up tries to fix it, takes about 30-45 minutes and another set of keys but we're finally in business.   So lets talk about the room.  Two of the lamps bulbs were burnt out.  The doors on the cabinet for the tv were nearly falling off.  The vanity lamp in the bathroom falling off if you wanted to actually move it and use it.  Air conditioning didn't work properly.  It was either, no joke, 60 degrees or 85.  So that I was either freezing cold under a blanket or sweating.  And during the night, the air just wouldn't turn on at all so it got even hotter.  The walls are incredibly thin so you can here everything and everyone.   The toilets have the loudest sound when flushed.  So imagine sleeping at being startled awake by the person flushing their toilet next door.   The decor is old which is the style of the hotel.  The room itself wasn't in poor condition just a few things here and there. There was a random beark skin blanket on the bed? Not sure why since it didn't match the victorian decor at all.  The bed was comfy and the pillows.  Which is always a plus except when you can't get a good nights sleep because you're woken so much thru the night. The room wasn't huge, standard size room, but had a nice full length mirror on the closet doors.  Lighting wasn't the best, I can't imagine the two other lamps would have shed much more light.  The bathroom was fairly lit and decent in size. Parking is $48 for valet for one night or $40 for the garage right across the street.  So pretty average there. I wouldn't stay here again, there are other hotels in the same price range that are nicer.",1
122,"Got a deal from a coupon site and used it in the spring.  The room had not been updated in my opinion since 1970.  The bed, nightstands and chairs were dusty and stained.  Even though it is close to Michigan Ave we had a beautiful view of a brick wall. They also have old fashioned TVs in the room!",1
123,"I stayed at the Whitehall hotel in April and overall had a great experience. The hotel itself is old and even though it went through a renovation not to long ago, it still felt old. The beds and rooms were very spacious and comfortable, but the elevators were very cozy (maximum 5 people, 4 with luggage). The staff are extremely nice, and has a small, but clean entrance/lobby. LOCATION: FANTASTIC! In the heart of the magnificent mile and never really needed a taxi! I'd stay here again for the price, comfortable beds, and the convenient location.",3
124,"I stayed here for two nights, May 23rd to May 25th.  I was upgraded to the Pinnacle Suite, room 1312 which was nice.  The hotel is definately showing some age with the elevators, electronics and furniture but it also provides some character to the hotel.  The bathroom was clean, the towels were clean, the amenities were nice. The only negatives I have for this place is that my bed was lumpy and when I was checking out, it took the bellman about 30 minutes to help me with my luggage.  The bellman said that they are in the process of upgrading the hotel and the individual units with new furniture so that should help this hotel in the future. In general, I got a good deal on the two nights I stayed, was upgraded to a suite and the staff was friendly.",3
125,"Hotel is well priced and has a good location if you're wanting to frequent the Magnificent Mile.  Its a small hotel, so the amenities are limited.  The beds were very comfortable and the a/c worked great.  The rooms are a little cramped.  Staff was friendly and were there to assist.  All in all, the Whitehall is a solid choice for your stay if you are just wanting place to get a good night sleep for a decent price.",3
126,"My husband and I live in downtown Seattle and went to Chicago for our 1 year wedding anniversary (and to visit family in the area). We stayed at the Whitehall and LOVED it. It was perfect. We stayed in a nice room that had been recently renovated. We bought the room through alaska airlines and it was a very good deal. This place was cozy, unique, fun & the staff were friendly. We also enjoyed the lounge downstairs. We'd stay here again for sure.",5
127,"I kept in mind that this hotel is old, and has alot of history, but it wasn't enough to make me ever go back. Upon arriving there was no clerk. Finally after 5 mins she shows up, and doesn't have our reservation on the computer so we have to sit and wait. Again. For 15 mins. Here she comes, we go to the room. It was a hard, lumpy FULL size bed. The tvs are old. The furniture is old. There was an old stained faux fur blanket on the old bed. You can hear your neighbors loud and clear. WORST PART 7am everyone is so loud in the hotel and outside. The windows in the room are right to the street where a cross walk guy was blowing a whistle at 7am for people and cars. The house keepers were talking loudly in the hall and I hardly slept a wink. also Internet was $10. This hotel had 4 stars On Hotwire and I don't understand that. I'm sleeping in the Marriott tonight which only has 2 stars and it's 100% better. All in all, don't waste your time or money on the Whitehall.",1
128,"I named my own price on Priceline and the Whitehall Hotel was selected. We arrived at Whitehall around midnight for s 5-day stay in Chicago. The hotel is located in the Gold Coast area of downtown Chicago and is only one block from the shopping along Magnificent Mile and Michigan Ave. The doorman took our bags and led us to the counter for check-in. The lady at the counter was friendly and explained the basics of the hotel, such as room service, on-site restaurants, and the business center. Up to the room we went. She then mentioned that we were upgraded to a junior suite...score! Entering the room on the 10th floor, the older decor was an instant eye-catcher, which is a good thing. A few of the artsy fixtures looked like something from medieval times and the bed frame was also old-fashioned (I added a few photos of our room). There is a small bench at the end of the bed which is good for watching TV or looking out of the window. The mattress on the bed was AWESOME, as it was very firm and conformed to my body. Six pillows lined the headboard, all of a somewhat different level of cushion. Closet space is standard, with a set of hangers, an ironing board, and a safe. Lighting was low, even with a ceiling light and five lamps spread throughout the room. I believe they need to add one more adjustable bright lamp, because the darkness is bad on the eyes when watching TV or using the computer. The bathroom was nice! Good power in the shower water, clean and fresh smelling, nice toiletries, and the hand soap was the same clam shell shape as the soap dish. Nice touch! A complimentary newspaper is left at the room door every morning and the soundproofing between rooms is solid. The housekeepers are friendly and if they see you in the halls, they ask if you need your room tended to...little things like this make hotels stand out. Lobby doors are opened for you when you come and go, and catching cab is a breeze as the cabs line up to the left of the building. The hotel is also close to State Street and is within walking distance to many areas around downtown. The hotel provides a number of maps and pamphlets to help you plan you daily activities. Sooo, my only ""gripe"" is the lack of lighting within the room. The hotel was remodeled a number of times and has very unique look compared to the more modern hotels that surround it in the same area. I would definitely stay here again.",4
129,"I like the style of Whitehall much better than Seneca, it's also an older hotel but the style is a little bit more modern than Seneca. It's definitely worth your money if you are to pay the same for the Whitehall or the Seneca. The only reason they are up for comparison is because they are both within steps of the Hancock center and they are both very historical buildings. However, Whitehall just renovated it to be a little more modern and a little less creaky than Seneca. The lobby still retains its old world flair but the rooms have been updated to have plush beds and nice bathrooms. This is the perfect spot for a secret weekend getaway because it makes you feel like you have been hidden away, yet are steps from Michigan ave!",4
130,"I really can't say enough good things about this hotel.  The entire place is recently rehabbed back to it's 1920's splendor and it shows.  The lobby, elevators, hallways are ""old hotel small"" but that I think adds to it's charm.  The rooms decor is top notch - Granted we were in one of their suites. Our room was loaded with antiques in great condition.  The bathrooms are very nice - hand-laid tiles, plenty of room.   The staff was very attentive, very responsive to inquiries and really were what you'd expect from a old school hotel like this. The location is perfect - a short block from Hancock and Water Tower Place, TONS of shops within easy walking distance (if that's your bag) and many top-notch restaurants also within 3 blocks in every direction. (not to mention a pretty good Itallian spot right in the hotel). This is definitely a hotel from an era long gone - but still at the top of it's game. *The price I listed as ""Moderate"" but keep in mind that that is in comparison to the other hotel options in the area.*  For the Gold Coast, it is a great price.",5
131,"You know, say what you want, but this place is precious. I call it ""the regular man's Four Seasons"" because it's right across from The Four Seasons Chicago which means you can go to the Conservatory at TFS and put on airs if you see fit, then go back to your quaint room at The Whitehall, nobody the wiser.   But honestly, dollar for dollar, I like this hotel better because of the charm. TFS has great service, sure, but the Whitehall is the little train that could, comparatively.  They try harder with less and do better. It's a different hotel.  Nostalgic, quirky, comfortable, neat.  The bar staff in particular rocks my world --- if Poppy is still there then management is damned lucky indeed.   Funny story about the series of shenanigans I encountered at this fine establishment but we won't go into it now, here.  What I'm saying though is maybe I'm sentimental and maybe you wouldn't feel the same if what you're looking for is The Four Seasons or The Pen.   But I've been to both those and many others and quite prefer The Whitehall in the final tally.  When I'm back in Chi, you'll be finding me there.",5
132,"I have now talked to some sort of manager named Abel.  He was the only person employed at the hotel who seems concerned about how his employees are behaving.  He asked me for times during which it all happened and specific details and then stated that he agreed for the most part that this was not acceptable.  He stated that he was going to address these employees about their behavior and then asked what I would like done.  I told him I just wanted my money back.    It has only been a few days, so I am trying to be patient at this point, but I still have not received my refund.",2
133,"I was in town for a conference, and they suggested the Whitehall.  First, the hotel is in a prime location near Rush Street and The Lake...Perfect for eating, drinking and jogging. This is a really different hotel.  Instead of a grand lobby like The Drake, it is rather small almost befitting a B&B.  The rooms, however, are spacious and lovely. Did I mention the rooms?",4
134,"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Whitehall Hotel for our Spring Break trip to Chicago (4 nights, 5 days). We'd checked out a BUNCH of hotels on Expedia and Yelped a bunch as well, and we settled at the Whitehall. We also got a great deal on our hotel + flight combo through Expedia, and we're glad we booked here. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location in Chicago. It's in the downtown area, and MINUTES away from any and all transportation you'd need to get where you've gotta be. It's a block away from the major buses you'd need, and only 3 blocks away from the L line. The decor of the place is nice -- it's a good mix of old-fashioned ideas with a modern touch. The people who work the desks are extremely helpful, and knew we were out of towners -- gave us some recommendations immediately for places to eat and even drew out how to get there...always a plus. The room itself: completely and absolutely perfect for what we needed it for. We weren't here to soak in bed all day, we were gonna be out exploring what Chicago had to offer. So the Whitehall delivered -- a BEAUTIFUL room (HUGE bed), with a nice bathroom and desk to plan things out. It was cleaned the same time each day, and the staff left it looking terrific. If we ordered anything to the room (such as towels, extra toothpaste, etc), they brought it up within 2-3 minutes, which is also a plus. The negatives: the real estate isn't great. Rooms are a bit on the smaller size, but again, it had everything we wanted and it had it done well. The other odd thing was the curtains...they weren't able to be closed. They were in a fixed open position, but luckily, there was a FIRST LAYER of blind to close the window off but allow SOME light in. Just an odd sort of characteristic. Overall, the Whitehall, for it's location and price, really can't be beat in my mind. Although it's got it's odd shortcomings, so does every hotel, and my girlfriend and i had an EXTREMELY pleasant stay here.",4
135,"Historic building with great employees, stellar location, and hard to beat price. 3.75 stars Cost to worth it ratio: 5 (we got this room for an average of ~$130/night including taxes! Four Seasons a few steps away goes for quadruple that.) Highlights: - Location: half a block from the famous Michigan Ave, across the street from Bloomingdale's on one side and the Hancock Tower on the other. Walking distance to most everything and short cab ride to Lincoln Park area. - Service: fantastic. After being checked in, they called a few minutes after we got settled to check how everything was. When we had to take the service elevator, we didn't complain but they apologized and let us take the hotel town car to dinner on them. :-) - Amenities: gym, 24 hr room service, restaurant/bar, wine shop, and mini bar. - Historic: building's been around forever--they have a 3 page story of it in the hotel's info binder. Midlights: - Atmosphere: rooms and lobby isn't anything special, but they're fine. Lowlights: - Only had 2 queen bed room when we checked in - 1 of 2 elevators they had was out the whole time. There are several floors, so that slowed things down quite a bit at times. On the place alone I might not be too impressed, but the price, service and location bumps it up a few notches so I'd consider staying here again.",4
136,"Famous stars such as John Travolta, Katharine Hepburn, and a few select others (which they pride themselves on serving once or twice; the full list can be found outside the building and inside near the check-in station) have chosen this hotel to stay at, and I get it. It's quaint, it's timely--it looks right out of what 1970's luxury class hotel should look like. We stayed on the 16th floor and had a nice view of a construction site, the Hancock building, and the American Girl doll shop. But for some reason, I can't get too into this place. I'm not sure if it's the fact that it lacked a decent screen on the 16th floor windows, paying $10/day for internet access (when I've had it free at plenty of others), the creepily trembling elevators, or that the staff were rude, but I just can't give this place five stars. However, despite those short comings, it was incredibly clean, the hotel is in a safe part of town, the beds are comfortable, and the drinks at the downstairs bar were fantastic. There are certainly good things to this place, and the $150/night (when it could probably and easily be much more in this town) wasn't bad either. The one thing I would like to know is, why were there three phones in our room? And one in the bathroom, nonetheless?",3
137,"Once you step out of the hotel to the right, you can see the John Hancock tower looming over you. Nice! The staff is professional and accommodating. They allowed me to switch my room from a 1 queen bedroom to a 2 queen with no hassles. The room was spacious and clean.The bed was very comfortable for me especially after I ran a marathon. My only issue was this dark brown fur coat thing on bed that was used for decoration. I certainly hope that it was not real animal fur. I quickly threw that off to the side. The hotel is across the street from the Four Seasons. Save your money and come here instead. This spot is cheap compared to other hotels because of its location. At the time I went there (October 2009), they were still renovating, which wasn't an issue for me. No free internet here and you pay $10 a day. I didn't realize this until my last day that they offer free wireless in the main parlor room in the lobby. Closest El Train: Chicago-Red (about 4 blocks away)",4
138,"Was in Chicago for a convention and had a limited budget. Found the Whitehall fit into that budget and was in a perfect location. I was concerned about some of the reviews on yelp and tripadvisor but, I thought I would give it a chance. Yes, it's old and small. Yes, it could use a makeover. But, for the price it's awesome. I did see the strings hanging of the chair in my room that someone photographed. Maybe I got the same room. But, come on, who cares. I wasn't hosting a social event. The place is clean. Things are worn but, not warn out. The bed is comfortable and they give you lots of fluffy pillows. I felt very comfortable leaving my personal items out on the bed or bathroom counter. The staff was extremely friendly and helped me quickly. The air conditioning was noisy and I had to use ear plugs. However I don't think it was any different then any other hotel in the area. The Four Seasons is directly across the street and at $500 per night they provide ear plugs for you. My friend stayed there for the same convention. The shower at the Whitehall gave me a warm shower everyday and the safe was large enough to hold my laptop. Bottom line if you want to pampered in a luxury hotel, go to a luxury hotel. If you want a great value go to the Whitehall.",4
139,"A decent location that I managed to book for a cheap price (~$110 per night).  We checked in early, which the concierge was ok with it.  We had some glitches with getting our room (from broken door to non-functional heating), but the staff was professional about it that we ended up in a room on the 15th floor with 2 king-sized beds (when we started with a 3rd floor room with 2 queen-sized beds). The hotel is under some renovation, so there were plastic sheets on the ground of every floor.  It wasn't a big deal to me. Overall, for the price and the location, I was quite satisfied with the quality of the room and the staff.  Would definitely consider this hotel again when I visit Chicago next.",4
140,"I'm going to start this review by saying that I really do despise boutique hotels. To think that for almost the same money I could stay at the Westin or Four Seasons and have all the ammenities I desire makes me wonder why I ever stay in boutique places at all. I don't care what anybody says, boutique means old. This boutique experience was a work necessity. They picked the hotel. It actually wasn't that bad. The staff when I got there was friendly. The staff when I left was friendly. I was the staff in the middle I didn't really appreciate. I also didn't appreciate the ancient elevator or the fact that I did end up in a lovely penthouse with a view only to wake up in the morning and realize the shower didn't work. After five calls to the front desk asking for a maintenance person to come up they sent the bellman instead to move my bags to another room. ??????? OK.... Anyway, when he moved me had he had the nerve to ask if I'd pulled the knob out! Of course I did! I'm not a freakin idiot. I do shower regularly. And in my showering career, I've definitely used a few different types of faucet. I've got it covered, I think. The bed at this place was actually really comfortable though and the mini bar was well stocked. This spot is walking distance to the best shopping in Chicago and also some great eats. I really enjoyed the close proximity to the Miracle Mile and Viagra Triangle.   The rooms were clean and well appointed. It was also nice to have the bar downstairs even if they did have last call at 11:30.",3
141,"I live in the suburbs and my BF and I were going to the city for a night on the town and decided to get a room for the evening so we didn't have to worry about driving back.  We looked at a few options and the location and price were the big selling points.  We have stayed at The Hilton and Hard Rock and the Whitehall was about 30% less.  We booked about 3 days in advance and it was about $150 for the night.  The hallways were narrow and the front lobby and elevators were realitivly small.  I already had the prenotation the rooms were going to be tiny, but to my suprise the rooms were really spacious!  Super comfy bed with a bear skin blaket throw. The room was bigger than The Hard Rock and the Hilton.  There wasnt a fridge but most hotels downtown dont have refrigerators. The location was su-purb! It was about a 2 block walk to the red line.  We partied that evening in Lincoln Park  and it was about a $12 cab ride back to the hotel.",4
142,"The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are clean.  However, the service is horrendous and they slyly charge an extra  $100 ""standard incidental fee"" at check out.  The fee isn't listed on the final bill you sign, so it's a hidden fee that in this day seems a$$ backwards.  So be forewarned that while you may have only authorized x amount, you'll see a charge on your account for x + $100 instead.  Completely aggravating.         The hotel is still under renovation and has plastic covering the hallways, so it's a little dingy.  The rooms are quiet, the bed is actually really comfy, and if you're a hobbit who enjoys waking up to frigid water in the dead of Winter you'll love the shower height and water temp.  There isn't a coffee maker or fridge in the room, so plan on running to a cafe for your morning fix and don't bother with leftovers if you eat out.  We mistakenly ordered a pot of coffee the 1st morning and had to wait 40 minutes for it to show up.  Also, skip Fornetto Mei downstairs--we stopped in for drinks before dinner and waited 20 minutes before leaving because no one took our order :( Forget about staying here when there are so many other better options where you will actually get basic hotel services and not get ripped off. Update: fyi the extra fee I was charged was removed a few days later.",1
143,"3.5  I ended up at The Whitehall because they offered the best rate going for my last minute, end-of-week, one-night biz trip stay.  A happy chance meeting for me.  I'd stay here again. If you're looking for a shiny modern-contemporary boutique hotel experience, this isn't it.  Whitehall has a more comfortable, traditional vibe that wouldn't be hurt by a little updating -- perhaps an interior paint job, some more modern lighting.  But don't be put off by the lobby area (rather dark and fusty) as the rooms are much nicer. The staff I dealt with was friendly and helpful (walking maps, suggestions, taxi-hailing).  Although I'd reserved a king they offered to switch me to a larger corner room with two queens so I could enjoy a view.  Glad I agreed, for two reasons:  1) the view;  2)  with two beds in the room it meant I could do one of my favorite things to do when traveling & staying alone in a hotel - build a big downy bed-cocoon in one bed using the pillows and comforter from the second.   And honestly....The beds.  ROCKED.  Their matresses have some sort of brand name like 'Hypnose' or 'Hypnotic' or something like that, and they were.  The pillows were perfect, the comforter was light and downy, and the high-thread count sheets slid against my skin like, well, high-thread count sheets.  I don't usually sleep well in unfamiliar surroundings on the first night, but I did here -- thanks to my high-thread count bed cocoon and the perfectly quiet environment (I was on the 15th floor, which might account for the silence). The bathroom was dandy, the complimentary robes delightful, and the view charming.  After getting back around 10:30 or so from my biz-event on Friday night I did find myself wishing they had 24-7 room service of some sort.  I was hungry and tired but had to wander down to the attached restaurant, Fornetto Mei, to try and snag something to bring back to my room before the restaurant closed...and it was about to, so mine was the last order of the evening.  Ended up getting a room temp pizza that was just 'meh.' The Whitehall's location is superb, particularly if you're like me and you decide at the last minute that you don't want to wear what you brought to wear to the event you have to be at in three hours.  I just strolled across the street to the shopping plaza that houses Bloomies, Banana Republic, a freshly opened Karen Millen boutique, JCrew, etc. etc., and had a mini shopping spree.  Lots of other posh, high-end boutiques in the area too if you're staying at the Four Seasons and have the matching bank account. * Fun Factoid?  (I should probably look this up before spreading potential misinfo...too lazy)   Someone at my biz event told me the Whitehall was famous as the hotel the Rolling Stones used to stay in and, presumably, party in and otherwise generally act like the Rolling Stones in, back in the day.",3
144,"Ok, so I read a lot of reviews on yelp and another site before writing my review.  I agree with everyone that said the beds are wonderful, they truly are.  On our king size bed we had at least 5 pillows and there was one in the closet.  I love having plenty of pillows! ELEVATORS The elevators are small, very small.  Not a negative, since they move quickly.  I was very cramped when I was in there with 2 guys , a mom, her mom, and her kid.  Yikes, I was afraid the cables wouldn't hold.   CHECK IN/OUT The lobby is small, but the staff was very pleasant and welcoming!  I was pleased that we were able to check in early and check out late.  We checked in at noon and out at 1:00, huge plus!  They also kept our bags until we caught the train home later that day at 6.   STAFF Everyone that we had contact with was sweet and polite.  The consierge (sp???) was great!  Super helpful. RESTAURANT ON LOCATION Unless you got the Groupon that we did skip Mei Fornetto, it's not worth it for breakfast.  Pretty expensive.  We didn't eat there for any other meal.  The food we had was really good, though. ROOM Our room had a horrible view, but whatever, I could really care less.  I prefer to walk in it instead of just looking at it!  We had no issue with the shower at all.  We had no issue with hearing anyone around us.  The room was a little on the dark side.  The TV is in an odd location for watching TV in bed...until my husband figured out you can slide the doors in and pull the TV out.  Again, the beds totally rock.  Everything was clean.  I'm pretty leary about taking a bath in a hotel, but I did-several times and didn't worry about it at all.  I didn't like how we didn't have a coffee maker in the room.  I get up earlier than my husband and the first thing I like to do is have some coffee in my jammies.  I couldn't, unless I wanted to brave the lobby that way.  It also really pissed me off when they took the coffee away before 11 AM!!!  It's supposed to be out until then, but was taken away by 10:40 one of the mornings, grrr.  Don't mess with my coffee.  The coffee situation is the only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me.  The internet was included with our Groupon.  Had I paid for it I wouldn't have been to pleased, it was pretty sketchy. SUGGESTIONS We ate at Nuevo Leon in Little Village (we are in the Detroit area, and here it's called Mexicantown).  The food was great!  Cash only and out of the way, but we were kid free for a few days and it was not a big deal.  We took the 151 to State/Lake and then got on the pink line to 18th, walked a few blocks and were there. Get a Metra pass for the time you are there, it's so much easier and the locals are very helpful for which bus you need.  We got ours at Union Station when our Amtrak came in, it was $14pp for 3 days-totally worth it!",4
145,"My boyfriend and I got a Groupon to stay here for New Years Eve. Our Groupon was expired but they ended up honoring it anyway. The customer service was great. They were able to squueze us in for a late dinner. But when we got to the dining room, it was pretty empty; I'm pretty sure they could have put us in earlier time slot. And then the staff rushed us out really quickly. It was understandable becuase it was 10pm on NYE, but their boss should've just put us in earlier. However, the food was awesome! Overall, we had a great stay!",4
146,"This is the best value hotel in Chicago hands down.  And I think it's because of all the renovations that were going on.  I read some other reviews and found that they've been going on for some time.  I always wondered why it was so cheap for a landmark hotel each time I saw it on Orbitz.  I'm sure the prices will go up once they are finished. My room had a sort of old charm.  I originally reserved a kingsize bed, but took the queen just so I could check in early.  Queen beds are pretty small once you've been sleeping in a kingsize for the better part of your life.  But it was sufficient. Minibar, check.  In-room safe, check.  Duvet, check. The location doesn't get much better.  You're a block away from Water Tower Place and everything you need is in walking distance.  If you take a quick trip down the alley adjacent to the hotel, you'll find yourself at a Starbucks, and if you take the alley across the street, you'll find an Einstein Bros. bagel shop.  Both among my favorites. My only complaints: They charged for crappy ""wired"" internet. When I checked in, I told them that my flight wasn't until 7pm on my day of departure and they suggested I book another night--which I did.  Meanwhile, on the insert that my room key came in, they said that for $60, that they can accommodate late check-out up to 6pm.  So I reversed the reservation and told them I'd like to take advantage of their $60 charge instead.  When my check-out time came, I called just to confirm that I would be leaving late and the guy said I could stay until 1pm.  Why would I pay $60 to stay an extra hour when I could have booked another night for a preferential rate of $90?  Finally after a bit of attitude, he agreed to let me stay until 5pm.  I left at 4.",3
147,"Friendly staff, clean rooms, but no free wi-fi!  $9.99/24hrs and the quality was bad at that.  Signal, no signal, signal...   Room service always efficient and friendly.  Breakfast average.  Air conditioner broke twice, owner apologetic.  Not our choice Chicago hotel, but it's in our timeshare network so we make do.",4
148,"I was kicked out of my condo one night (long story) and had to find a place in the city to stay, so I thought I'd treat myself to a four-star hotel. Despite my better judgment, I went to HotWire and selected a ""blind"" 4-star at $159/night in the Streeterville area, which turned out to be the Whitehall. As other reviewers have noted, this is a clean hotel with friendly service and I have no doubt that 70 years ago it was one of the top hotels in the city. Unfortunately it has remained largely in its original state. The beds are comfy, the pillows are fluffy, but the place is extremely out-dated; almost as if you'd walked into a time machine. The elevators are tiny, bordering on claustrophobic, and if more than two people are attempting a ride, they will all become much better acquainted than they might have liked. The hallways are equally confining; narrow, dark, a little depressing. The rooms aren't large, there's no wireless Internet, the lamps are original fixtures with unchanged (and probably untested) circuitry-- as confirmed by a quirky switch on one in my room, that refused to turn on without some coaxing. Similarly, the bathroom telephone had a poor connection. Worst of all, my room smelled of decades of cigarette smoke. Horrible. The decor is somewhat dreary, definitely not warm. All of these are symptoms of a hotel begging to be upgraded. On the plus side, the location is great, my room was quiet, the staff was friendly, and the price was right-- although next time, I'll select the hotel myself, pay the additional premium for the privilege, and enjoy it perhaps a little more. This is definitely not the place to stay if you want something light, modern, and cheerful.",2
149,"UPDATE: Stayed here again for the same conference.  Between 2 - 3 stars.  I did like that they were willing to call me when they had a room available since I checked in early. I thought I was supposed to be in a pinnacle king (which i booked on http://Hotels.com) and mentioned this to the lady who checked me in.  She told me ""yeah, you're in a superior king""  Only after I had unpacked all my stuff did I realize that there WAS a difference ( I thought maybe there were two names for the same room).  At that point, it wasn't worth calling to complain. Laid down to take a nap after I got into my room at 12:30.  Was woken up about an hour later by the lady who came to check the mini bar to see if the prior occupants had used anything.  Saw her doing the same two days later when I was leaving.  Why not do it when the room is being cleaned?    Still got charged for a Snickers i had to call and ask to be removed from my bill (I HATE snickers). At least twice when someone came to my room, I was in the bathroom, and heard them getting keys out to enter my room....had to hop off the toilet so they wouldn't find me in a compromising position. Last year thought the Whitehall was great.  This year....not so much.  These seem like system issues, not random issues that could happen to anyone. Stayed at the Whitehall a week for a conference. Pros:  Incredibly comfy beds and fine linens.  Large spacious room, considering it is an older hotel.  I had two queen beds, but there were also two sitting chairs with a table in between them.  Each bed had a bedside table.  Everything was well spread out, not cramped together.  Elevators were small, but fast (last year I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton and routinely waited 5 minutes for an elevator, which irritated me).  Beautiful tile work in the bathroom.  Friendly, accomodating staff.  Lighted makeup mirror in the bathroom.  Close to Michigan Ave. Cons:  Small bathroom, although this is not unexpected given it is an older hotel.  No ice machines on the floors.  I really hated this.  Every time you want ice, you have to call room service.  Then I wasn't sure if I should tip for something I'd rather do myself anyways?  TV was old and of poor quality, and the movie channels (pay per view) didn't come in well. As you can see, the pros outweigh the cons.",2
150,"Okay. I am SUPER picky about hotels and I usually pick the hotel but this time my b/f chose the hotel. The Whitehall Hotel is an older hotel. It has old charm and it is in a awesome location. (walking distance to pretty much everything) But, again, it was an older hotel. The elevators were small and every time I walked into my room it smelled like an old folks home. Also, the walls are thin. It never failed, each night at 2am the guy above me came in, slammed his door and took a shower. I could hear it all. BUT, on a positive note, the staff was friendly and helpful, the hotel was in a good location and the bed was comfortable.",2
151,"My mom really loved this place. We arrived at 8AM, wanted to check in really early, and they got us in quite early at 12PM. We just walked around town for a bit, and our room was ready. The valet parking was $45 a night (or for 24 hours) but was convenient and safe. They have free coffee and tea in the morning. Only one downer was that wireless is $9.99 a day, what? Who charges for internet these days? I guess they want to keep that also historic just like their building. You could tell the building wasn't brand new, but the rooms were very clean and neat. Air conditioning worked great and the water pressure was awesome. They have clean down pillows and down comforter which made me feel at home. If it wasn't for the paid wireless internet, I would have given them 5 stars. But it was well worth the $96 I paid through expedia.",4
152,this is a clean hotel with comfy pillows and beds.  Everything was clean and the staff was helpful.  Only weird thing was the service came in and cleaned up the room but didn't leave new toiletries.  Upon request we got all we needed!  The rooms were a good size and we were on the 3rd floor.  Due to some decorative awnings we could only look down out our window to the street.  I would have liked to have been able to look up as well. It's located in a great spot close to everything.  Navy Pier was our farthest walk at almost a mile. I will say the window glass must be pretty thin because there was a bit of street noise. I would rank this hotel somewhere between Holiday Inn & Marriott.  It was a nice place I would go to again and was well worth the 110.00 rate,4
153,"After staying at a big hotel like the Hyatt, I really appreciated The Whitehall Hotel, and how quiet and cozy it is. Location, fabulous, a block away from the Hancock Observatory, and a few blocks away from Oak Street beach, and the red line. The room and bathroom were very nice (see pictures). Luis approved. Layout of room was OK, until I opened the drawers. The bed and drawers are too close to each other, if the drawers are open it blocks the path to walk to the other side of the room. I did not like this, it didn't make me feel fancy anymore. No nice view here. I don't know if I was just not lucky enough to get a nice view or if all rooms are like this. But since I didn't plan to look out the window that much, it didn't bother me. One more thing I will complain about is the temperature of the room. I don't know if it was me that didn't know how to work the thermostat thing or if It was set to a standard temperature. I love my room to be über cold, so I can sleep, and every time I would get back to my room after going out, it would be too hot for me. No likey my room warm. So I had to adjust it every time.  Annoying. The tv was pretty old too, a little upgrade and new furniture wouldn't hurt. Things I liked, were that it was quiet, it didn't feel like a mall, not a lot of people. Most of the time the elevator was not crowded, and it was fast. The service was very nice. The person at the front desk recommended me going to a nearby Internet cafe to use the computer instead of using the hotel's. That way I would get to use the Internet and get a nice cup of coffee instead of just spending my money at the hotel's business center. I thought that was nice of him. I stayed here for 4 days. I probably was that guy that came in at 2am every night, that someone commented earlier on their review, but I did not slam the door, the door makes a big noise when it locks. Sorry. Lol. Anyways. I loved coming back to my room and sleeping in that bed after a long night. I'd definitely stay here again. The things I complained about are no biggie, but if fixed they would get a 5 star.",4
154,"Got a good deal on a room here--decent location, but a bit boring in the Upper East Side kind of way. Rooms are very nice and spacious. I'd stay here again. The building used to be luxury apartments way back when, but then morphed into a hotel, and now a ""luxury boutique"" hotel. It's got a nice wood-paneled lobby that used to serve as a private restaurant for the former luxury apartments.",4
155,"I will keep this short & sweet...  Chicago is a beautiful, clean city!  As far as our hotel stay for a week not so beautiful.  The bed was very comfortable, but the room felt dirty.  We were supposedly upgraded to a room with peeling wall paper and very scuffed up furniture and walls.  I wouldn't consider that an upgrade.  The location and beautiful city, good company of my significant other and bed were about all that I remember.",1
156,I was raised in Chicago and downtown and the north side are my stomping grounds. When I saw the rate for the Whitehall hotel online I jumped at the chance to stay in the heart of the Gold Coast walking distance from all of my favorite places.                                                                    The only reason they are not getting a better star review from me is because.....when I went to raise the window in my room the entire window came off in my hand and I almost fell out from the 15 floor. I put it back on the tracks and cracked the other window to get some air  instead. The outlets were loose in the walls and the shower head was loose. They advertise mini bar in the room but don't think that is a fridge because it is not.                   Other than that the staff was nice enough not all smiles but it is Chicago. . . The sheets and the bed were amazing and the gym is pretty cool to have to work out in. This place is about location. You cannot beat the price for were you are. Parking is a bitch....$48 a night but what you gonna do . . . It's Chicago.   Walk over to the Pancake House 7am-3pm for the best breakfast in the Gold Coast. Over all I would stay there again for the price.,3
157,"Stayed here in February for the Illinois Bar Exam.  All in all, not a bad place! Pros:  The food is great, the bathrooms (recently remodeled) were fabulous and the mini-bar is well stocked and the prices are not out of the ballpark.  Plus, they are undergoing a remodel and they have really worked hard to accentuate their space.  the building itself is not very large, with lots of twisty turny hallways, but they apportioned and accommodated it well.  Also, the gym is really complete as far as hotel gyms go. Cons:  It takes a bit for the staff to warm up to you.  They are brusque and professional, but it seems like you have to talk to them for several minutes before they start to be nice as well.  Also, it took the valet a long time to find my car.  Finally, about the re-model, I'd have liked them to follow through a bit more . For a 4 star hotel, there were too many visible wallpaper seams and other such aesthetic issues showing.   BUT, I would gladly stay here again.",4
158,"A lovely hotel, although the rooms on the higher floors seem to be more recently renovated (it would probably have only gotten three stars if I'd stayed in my friend's room down on the third floor instead of my lofty one with the fluffy comforters and down pillows on the 16th). It's really close to Michigan Avenue shopping and the feeble contemporary art museum, but a bit of a walk to the Art Institute and Millenium Park.",4
159,"Beautiful clean room. Very attentive service. After I has been in my room for 20 min the concierge called to see if I was happy with my room. Lots of toiletries, superb location. So many restaurants are within walking distance. I always book this place through hotwire. They describe it as a four star hotel in the mag mile area.",5
160,"I have to say that this is the worst place I have ever stayed at. Reserving a room was a hassle because I had to wait for the concierge to call me back...3 hours later. When we arrived the door man was pleasant and polite. The staff at the front...wasn't even present. We had to stand there for about 10 minutes before the doorman went back to look for the guy. Then front desk staff guy said they ""upgraded"" our room. We were okay to hear this. When we got to our room...disappointed. The elevators are ghetto and old looking. The hallway to our room is dark and shabby looking. The cups in our room had finger prints all over them. The shower had mold in the caulk and in the corners. The caulking at the base of the tub and the floor was cracked and stained looking. The toilet was dirty looking. They do not have ice machines or a vending machine for snacks or a small hotel store. We needed some ice for drinks we bought to the room and they sent up a guy with an ice bucket. This guy was not professional at all. He came in with regular street clothes and he actually welcomed himself in the room without my okay for him to come in. The ice is from the chinese restaurant downstairs. There is nothing luxurious or hotel like about this place. It is as creepy as a run down motel. Checking out took us 15 minutes before the front desk guy even came to the front. He was very rude. We were only staying at this hotel because we had a certificate given to us. I did not like this place. Do not spend your money on this place!",1
161,Everytime my parents come to town they stay at The Whitehall due to a friend's discount. We love it there. Its downtown in the mix but its not too touristy and its not too crowded. Great customer service and great rooms. I love going to the bar for a quick cocktail before heading out to dinner. The beds are super comfortable. The Whitehall is just fabulous!,5
162,Stayed there for three nights in June 2011. It's a convenient location and the price was fairly reasonable. Negatives: 1) elevators are small to begin with (6ppl max) but then they broke down 2) poor mattress - caused back pain 3) dark room with poor lighting 4) old building and rooms (not sure when was the last time they renovated Employees were friendly but would not stay there again because the mattress gave me back pains.,2
163,"Great hotel. I was impressed by the location and friendly staff. Rose, our saturday bartender,  was one of the best I have encountered.",4
164,"I love old fashioned hotels, but love my comfort too!  The Whitehall has both!  It has a wonderful history since 1920s, and a charming atmosphere.  Our room was a bit on the small side compared to more modern hotels, but otherwise very comfortable.  The hotel is connected to an italian restaurant Fornetto Mei which also includes a bar and a connecting lounge area between the hotel and restaurant with comfy sofas and seating  to relax with friends.  The hotel is just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower Place - a great area with lots of great restaurants, sights and shopping.  If you have a car, the valet parking is very convenient.  It was $39 in May 2007 with unlimited in-out privleges.  I did notice a public parking across the street on Delaware Ave. that might be cheaper, but sometimes it's just so nice to let the valet handle it!",4
165,"NOTE:  I have never actually stayed in the hotel -- this is for their bar/restaurant. Ok, I must admit, I used to be the kind of girl who loved hotel bars.  But that was a lifetime ago and I stopped that sort of thing.  But, awhile back, I started getting my hair done across the street at Studio 110 and having cocktails before and after at the Whitehall across the street (seriously, try going to your next hair appointment loaded - it's super fun.)  Anyway, it's not your typical hotel bar.  And the food is delicious.  Specifically, the pot stickers (those are the ones that are steamed right?)  Well, these motherf*ckers changed my life.  That and their pizzas.  delicious.  use the hot chili oil.  do it!  Me and two others split a pizza and had a dozen dumplings (they had a few -- i had many) and a a delicious Cab.  I was in heaven.  Pure heaven.  Do it.  The next time you are downtown or at Studio 110, go here for food and drinks.  Plus, when you walk to the back bar area (not the restaurant) you can sit on big plush couches and chairs and hang out and drink and eat.  It's so not typical Michigan Ave. I bet staying at the hotel is nice too...get loaded and roll on up to bed.",5
166,"Mom stayed here on one of her visits and she LOVED it.  View of the Hancock.  She found the location exceptionally convenient.  We had a car and driver at our disposal - scheduled times.  Everyone was authentically friendly, but ultimately service-oriented and elegantly mannered.  I brought flowers for her and the maid went out of her way to find a bottle/vase for us which worked out perfectly.  I sometimes wonder if real service still exists in this modern and too egalitarian society (meaning disrespectful and/or just poor or absent etiquette) and then I think of the Whitehall.  Hats off.  I suggest setting up your parents here if they like a smaller-scale more personable hotel, someone who remembers what real service is, or anyone you wish to especially impress in subtle and quiet ways without having to choose the modern and massive usual suspects.",5
167,"Great location for a cozy hotel at a fraction of the price of the hotels within a block or two. Older, smaller rooms, but I liked it and I appreciated the delightful people who work the front desk...when looking to visit Chicago or for a ""staycation"" for those in the suburbs over a special weekend for shopping or downtown sights.",4
168,"Chicago has many lovely smaller old-fashioned hotels of the boutique variety. The Whitehall may just be the classiest of the bunch. It can barely be categorized as a smaller hotel, but with slightly over 200 rooms it definitely is no behemoth convention hotel. The building is a charmer, and it has a great location just off from Michigan Avenue. The rooms are plush and so are the bathrobes.",4
169,"I wanted to spend the night downtown with my man for his birthday so I hot wired a hotel. We got this one. The hotel itself is in a perfect location if you want to experience all that Chicago has to offer. Close to Water tower, The Hancock and all the bars and restaurants. Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff who were very friendly. At check in I could see a look of concern cross Derrick's face and I knew there was going to be some drama rama with the fact that we booked through hot wire. He said the room I had booked was not available , however, he was able to upgrade us to a better room which I thought was very nice of him. I do question why I am able to book a room but not actually know for sure that I have it. Derrick advised that we book direct in future which I understand but the whole point of Hot wire is no get a better deal right? The room itself was nice, very large four poster bed, although I think someone may have swung from them as they were a little wonky! The sheets were lovely quality and so comfy. The TV was kinda old school but was fine. Overall this was a nice hotel and a good value. I like that it was small and ""boutique"" and close to the action.",4
170,"This place is great, full bar downstairs, great food selection at the restaurant, the after hours menu sucks but whos up at 4 in the morning eating Antipasta? USA Today everymorning, they have smoking and non smoking floors, the room was just quality. I dont think i have ever slept well in a hotel, this place changed my hotel experiences. It was awesome def. Recommend.",5
171,"I love this hotel! It is really close to Michigan Avenue, but on a quiet street. The location is excellent, and the staff are welcoming and friendly. The room prices are very reasonable, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. We booked a block of rooms for our wedding, and were so happy with how everything turned out. Our guests loved the location, the rooms, and were very satisfied with the room prices. While it is not new or very modern, the rooms are very nice and I would recommend this hotel.",5
172,"It all goes downhill once you get past the friendly doormen.   If I knew then what I know now, I'd take my business elsewhere both for the room and the drinks.  The location is good and the rooms are clean, but that's all the praise I can muster.  Chicago is a huge city with tons of great bars and hotels.  These days you don't have to sacrifice service for a buck.",1
173,"Very spacious room and friendly staff. I'm big on a coffee maker in-room, and sadly our room did not have one. Wi-Fi was not included in our rate and was expensive. We did appreciate being close to tourist attractions and public transportation.",3
174,"This place is an upscale but basic hotel.  If you want a comfortable room, clean bed, and good location for a decent price, this is your place.  It's not a resort; while it's very nice the rooms are pretty small and simple and you won't want to hang out in the hotel.  But if you are just looking for a good place to lay your head after traipsing around Chi-town, then go for it.  Clean, comfortable bed, good amenities, free mediocre coffee in the morning, etc.",4
175,"My first time in Chicago and I knew I wanted to stay someplace within walking distance from everywhere that I wanted to go. This place totally fit the bill. You're 4 blocks from the Red Line and a block from Michigan Ave, you really do get a great location for half the price you would pay at Four Seasons, which is down the street. The bed was super comfortable, with plenty of pillows and a down comforter. They were still undergoing renovations so that was slight minus on the noise, but considering that I spent most of my time outside in the city, I didn't mind it as much. You do have to pay for internet, but luckily my friend brought her Verizon wireless card so we didn't have to pay for internet. There's a tiny gym on the 2nd floor that opens in the morning so I got in some quick cardio workouts before heading out. All in all, probably one of the better hotels I've stayed at for the price I paid.",4
176,"Awesome location and at a great value. Very clean and loved the mini kitchen in our suite microwave and refrigerator. Friendly staff and comfy mattress, what more can a girl ask for? How 'bout fantastic bathroom products.",4
177,"A very good hotel from a service and comfort perspective.  Even for Chicago, they took you for a ride on the parking ($55 per night) and I will never understand ""internet charges"".  Really, I a mean come on .. after all the fees and inflated parking the hotel decides to stick one last knife in you and charge you for the internet service.  Just skip it and go to McDonalds.. ride the wi-fi for free. Other than that, the room was extremely nice and comfortable and would clearly stay here again.",3
178,"Room Robbed!!! While my parents danced at my wedding, their room was being robbed.  They came back to find a laptop, iPad and camera gone.  My parents' keys were accounted for, and there was no sign of a ""break in"" which means whoever stole their electronics had their own key to my parents' room. The police and hotel are investigating and I hope that the hotel beefs up their security as a result. I am completely devestated that this robbery happened and tainted what should have been one of the happiest nights of mine and my parents lives. My parents have travelled the world extensively and have stayed in hundreds of hotels, they never expected this to happen at a Hilton in Chicago. I felt compelled to warn others to avoid having anyone else go through this experience.",1
179,"I'm from a college town in central Ilinois. I travel a fair amount for twentysomething, and I was raised by a single mom without a ton of money to burn. So that's my perspective going into this. My mom was asked to come up to the city to have a corporate meeting and dinner with the suits afterwards. Since we're very close and I'll take any excuse to be in the city ('sup H&M and newly opened Topshop), she got the okay for me to come along. She was assured that the room was put on the company card and she wouldn't have to pay for it to be later reimbursed. She even got a printed confirmation of this, and the company card info. When we got there, this wasn't the case. I waited out front in the rain with the painfully friendly valet workers for a while and found out that they needed her to pay for the room after all, and it would only be straightened out once the corporate people got there. One of the employees wasn't too nice about it, and said that the refund could only be done by the manager the next morning. This was a lie, because a regular old employee did it anyway (still the next morning, however). The rooms are very spacious. There's a little kitchenette/minibar type situation (with no liquor, though, boo) with small appliances, a living room/office with a pullout couch, desk, chair, table, and a flatscreen. The bathroom is nice, and the shower has a tall showerhead (I'm almost six feet, rejoice). The bedroom is okay, with lots of pillows and another flatscreen. The brightness of the TVs auto adjusts to the light in the room, which I like. We were almost on the top floor, and when I was in my bed, I was looking right at the Hancock Building, which was across the street. WiFi costs $10 for 24 hours, which I did not see coming, and wasn't too happy about. Location is obviously fantastic, even if the closest train stop is slightly farther than convenient after a long day. If you can afford to stay here, you're probably not taking a train around town. At the end of the day, it was impressive in the ways it needs to be for its demographic. But for a college girl who knows the city like the back of her hand (read: just wants convenient trains to neighborhoods I care about, not to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and shop at Water Tower) and is used to free WiFi and breakfast in her hotel rooms, it left a few things to be desired. But hey, we didn't pay for it! Well technically we had to. But we got our money back the next day.",3
180,"I am a fan of the Hilton chain of hotels and this one proves no different. The rooms are large, it's an all suite hotel, and as a single traveller I had plenty of room for myself. It was really nice to be able to spread out. The bed is soft and the sheets are comfortable. The heating worked and I had a great view of the lake. The people who work there were helpful and knowledgeable about the local area and how to get around. I felt safe in the neighborhood and walking around at all hours. It is close to places to eat and shopping. It's off the beaten path so you don't hear traffic or the noise of the street. The heated pool and the hot tub were a much enjoyed added bonus. I felt spoiled as I sat in the hot bubbles and watched a blizzard fall outside. This is a great hotel and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It is good for families, singles, couples (although it's not overtly romantic) and business travelers. There is a charge for internet (which I don't ever agree with in hotels) and they have room service, but no breakfast. There are better places to stay in Chicago, but this is a good choice if you're given it. Enjoy!",4
181,"This was a great location for what we were doing in Chicago, and they take pets (although ours wasn't with us).  The rooms were nice, and it was a nice property.  This definitely isn't a high-end Hilton, but there was nothing wrong with it.  It felt a bit stale - like some of the downtown hotels that you experience in New York.   That said, we enjoyed our stay and the price was right.",4
182,"I grew up in Chicago and  early last month I came with my four year old son for a visit.  We had a horrible experience with the front desk but everything else was perfect.  I really liked the rooms and every other experience with the hotel staff was just fine.   Here's where I found impressive.  After I filled out the survey, the head of security emailed me because I'd only rated his department an 8 out of 10.  I told him that I could have very easily given him a 10 but I found it ironic that he'd reached out to me because it was the front desk I had a horrible experience with.   So he connected me with the head of rooms.  After much phone and email tag, I finally was able to communicate why the front desk fell WAAAAAAAAAAAAY SHORT.  The rooms manager then gave me a free certificate for my next stay.  Wow.  Totally unexpected.  That's awesome. Guess we'll be staying there again.",4
183,"Very nice room.  Very nice price.  AWESOME location.  Did valet parking around the corner for $28 for the night, not too shabby for Chicago. Room was laid out soo well, we almost felt like we were in an apartment.  Bed was very, very comfy and I have a hard time sleeping throughout the night at a hotel.  Check in/out was quick and everyone on the staff was willing to help us if needed. The only downside?  The elevators were insanely slow.  We waited about 5 minutes every time we needed to go somewhere, thank god the Ice Machine was on our floor!",4
184,"This is a nice hotel in a good location.  If you are going to Chicago to specifically visit the American Girl Doll this hotel is ideal.  It is about two blocks away from the  store and the rooms at this hotel are suites so they're perfect for families  That wasn't the case for us, but I think a point worth mentioning.   I liked that we were in close walking distance to everything on Michigan Avenue but yet not right on that street. The staff was friendly. The best part about this hotel was the price.  We booked online at Priceline and paid $95 for the room.  Can't beat that!  They get you on the parking, $55 for 24 hours with in and out privileges but let's face it, who is driving their own car around when they are visiting downtown Chicago?   In the grand scheme I guess that is the rate you are going to pay for overnight hotel parking in a major metropolitan city so there really isn't an alternative if you have a car.   I would definitely stay at this hotel again but next time I come to Chicago I want to take the MegaBus.  By no means am I a cheap person but  I absolutely hate paying high prices for parking.  Anything over $20 a day sends me into a tizzy.   If I could I would get rid of my car altogether but the city I live in does not have infrastructure to be car free :(  OK, no more ranting!",3
185,"This hotel is in a great location near Lake Michigan. shopping and restaurants. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. Taxi cabs are very accessible at this location. I had a great stay and looking forward to a return trip.",4
186,"I recently had a wonderful stay at this Hilton location. The linens and curtains were surprisingly modern and tasteful (unlike at some hotels - ahem, plaid, floral, etc!) in neutral colour offerings and the suite was very spacious. The hotel itself was very quiet and insulated from all outside noise. I booked the room using http://www.hotwire.com (highly recommended). The hotel was perfectly located in the popular ""Magnificent Mile"" near several subway lines. If you want to experience ""the windy city"" this is the place to do it as there are so many tall buildings surrounding it, it's constantly blowing!! Conveniently located right across from the John Hancock building. The only downside is the internet - you can get wi-fi in your room but it's expensive ($12.95/day) or you can use the business centre if you're even MORE of a moneybags (pay by the minute I think). IMO it should be more affordable, especially for such a large hotel. Would definitely stay there again for a no fuss, flexible stay. Check in/check out times were reasonable and they gladly held our bags for no charge after we had checked out so we could enjoy our final day without baggage.",5
187,"Yay, another great Hilton hotel! They ""stuck"" us in a room on the 28th floor with a unobstructed view of Lake Michigan.  Flat screen T.V. in the living room.  Another T.V. in the bedroom.   Came with a concealed fridge and and microwave. Also a wet bar. The fluffiest biggest towels anywhere. The hotel restaurant breakfast buffet is very good with a lot of options. Nicely within walking distance of everything in downtown Chicago (one block off Magnificent Mile). And for what you get....the Hilton Suites is not that expensive.",5
188,"Formally a DoubleTree Suites, the hotel has graduated to Hilton status.  That said, to me it still feels more like a doubletree than the big H.  You know, a tiny convenience stand located in a small lobby. Decent but not fine furniture and interior.   That said, still a fine, clean and well maintained hotel.   Keep in mind, the locale is very central...close to many ChiTown sites, but also in a sterile neighborhood, lacking character.",4
189,"Five of us stayed here before my wedding, and while the room was clean and comfortable, our stay could have been much, much better. The day of check-in, it was raining.  We had quite a bit of things with us, and the bell hops did a pretty miserable job of bringing them in.  Worst of all, they had my wedding dress dragging on the floor and dropped my mom's dress for the wedding on the ground outside.   We had booked the suite well in advance, and got a pretty sweet deal online.   Upon check-in, Abraham mentions to us that there are no suites we had booked (2 beds in a separate bedroom, plus the fold-out couch in the living room separated by a door) left, so we'll have to take a smaller room.  We balked at this, and he insisted there was nothing that could be done.. until we asked to speak to the manager.  Then, miraculously, he found a suite for us.  Funny how that works.. The room itself was fine, but a few tweaks could have made our stay much more pleasant.  This is the only hotel I have ever stayed in that did not have an exhaust fan in the bathroom.  And for whatever reason, we were only given two rolls of toilet paper for five people for two and a half days.. even when our room was cleaned, no new rolls were given to us.   The business center charged the standard BS fees of something like $15 for 10 minutes of internet and $10 to print a few pages out.. and the parking at the hotel was close to $50 a night.  There is much cheaper parking a few blocks away, FYI.   I could see this hotel working for someone who just needs a bed to crash in that is conveniently located, but I would not stay here again for a special event and would not recommend this place to anyone.",2
190,"Definately, just a-ok. We had a junior suite, with two doubles and a pull out couch, and the 6 of us sharing the space were all very comfortable. The beds were so soft - without being two soft - and I slept so well each night, which is fairly uncommon for me without my own pillow at least. However, the service was less than ok.  We were told we could have a refrigerator brought to our room upon request. So we asked Friday night and were told it would be in our room shortly. Well, three phone calls and 24 hours later, we finally got one. Too bad it was too late for our Friday night leftovers. Also, our rooms were not cleaned until maybe 6pm each day, much later than any other hotel I've been in before. Even when they did clean, they didn't give us a new roll of toilet paper... With 6 people, that's a problem. Also, there were more than a few bugs in the bathroom. The location is great if you want to be really close to the Magnificent Mile, so maybe that helps.",3
191,"My place is so tiny that when people come to visit, they have to stay in a hotel. My mom was coming into town on a busy weekend and I happened upon a great deal at this hotel. Just east of the Mag Mile and taxis aplenty were what was needed. My mom loves to window shop, so she could wander in familiar surroundings while I commuted up to her. The room was the perfect size suite with doors connecting the bathroom to both the living area and the bedroom. Genius! Plus, it had a seperate closet/vanity area for dressing and primping. The bed was soft and comfy and the tvs in both rooms was a plus. The lobby is just fine....I mean, you're not staying at the Palmer House. Anyhoo, my mom loved this place for the price, location and cleanliness. It was a bit out of my way, but whatever makes Mom happy!",4
192,"This place gets 5 stars for one reason, and one reason alone. It was at this hotel that I saw my first topless woman. When I was a young kid, my family stayed at this hotel for a weekend. It was known as the Guest Suites back then. I vividly remember being at the pool on the top floor and looking out the window across the way to the condos across the street. Sure enough there she was, a topless 30 something (or at least that's what my 9 year old mind though), walking around in a thong. Oh man. I'm sad to report that they no longer have the black and white tvs in the bathroom that I used to think were so pimp, and that the parking is ridiculous ($50 a night, park at the self park at the Hancock across the street and save $20), but the rooms are huge, and the views are stunning. All in all a solid hotel, in a great location if you don't care about access to the el. Sadly no topless women this time.",5
193,"Want to stay in a quiet, almost private hotel a block away from the mag mile? This is your spot. It doesn't have a grand entrance and everything here is lowkey and under-the-radar. The Westin is a block away if you want something flashy...this is about comfort. I wouldn't shell out a ton of money to stay here as I got a hotwire deal ($68!) but it was a very nicely appointed room with what looked to be newer furniture and fixtures throughout. Also a view of John Hancock and just so close to all Chicago has to offer. I've only stayed at the Sheraton in the River North area, but I'd gladly pick HS over the Sheraton. Better location, better rooms, less crowded.",4
194,"I was not impressed at all with the Hilton, It was in a good location but the front desk was not very friendly, My daughter and I were looking for an apartment from California  and I thought I'd treat her to a nice hotel our first night, The room was cozy but very sterile, The view was not what I requested. Internet was $$$$ per day and the water pressure was a drip. But we made the best of it and went to days inn by lincoln park and received FREE internet all 3 days. Free breakfast all 3 days and very helpful front desk help. I can spend my money much wiser at other local hotels.",3
195,"I didn't actually stay here but met some friends here who were in  townfor a conference. The rooms are fairly well appointed. It's located conveniently across from Water Tower and the Hancock building, right off of Michigan.  The thing that sets this hotel apart, however, is the rock star pool, which is not only huge but on the top (30th?) floor with an amazing view of the Chicago skyline!",4
196,"The Doubletree Guest Suites is a very pleasant hotel a block east of the Magnificent Mile. No free breakfast here, but when you check in you get fresh cookies in the Doubletree tradition. The rooms are rather spacious, like mini-suites with the bedroom separate from the living area. There is a sharp indoor pool on one of the higher floors, so bring your binoculars even if you are not swimming.",5
197,"Very cute hotel situated at premier downtown Chicago, and their guest services (masseuse) are out of this world wonderful. I really have to thank my friend for telling me about this.",5
198,We recently booked a block of rooms for a wedding.   The only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is due to the front desk (horrendous) and security staff (unprofessional).  Catering 5 stars. Valet and door men/bell men get 5 stars. Wedding block personnel 5 stars.  Area of hotel 5 stars. Room 5 stars (was a large business suite).  Housekeeping 5 stars.,3
199,"I really liked staying here for a romantic evening. The service, modern decor and view was nice. I like the modern decor more and it was such a romantic time here! Steps away from shopping and fun!",5
200,"great hotel, really enjoyed the stay. we exhibited here also, and the concierge was so nice - i needed a vase or fish bowl or something for our drawing, and the lady found me a flower vase from some one's desk, and cleaned it out and let me use it! i mean that is nice! also the restaurant here in the lobby is decent, even though we ate pizza the WHOLE time we were there. bell hops were great and very nice, remembered me and my co-worker the whole weekend and helped with suggestions of places to eat, shop, etc. the room and bed was great also.  they are exactly as pictured.",4
201,"priceline = $65 suite for the night... checkin / checkout went as smooth as it gets... quiet, clean, comfortable... cant complain",4
202,"Rooms are OK, quite roomy, but that's expected for a hotel of suites. Every night was quite and the location is great.  Easy walk to lots of great restaurants.  The staff was great.  Front desk was one of the friendiest and happiest I have come across in awhile.  Even the Starbucks on site had two friendly Baristas.  Staff that kept up the meeting room was beyond excellent!  They saved the meeting because the food was bad.  Breakfast omelet day was OK, but everything else was poor at best.  Do yourself a favor and try the food before you have a meeting here.  You may want to go to Rosebud across the street for your meals.  That place is good!",3
203,"Great location and price. However beware of pullout like most sofas this is a horrible bar thin mattress. As a sofa it also is lacking just sitting on the plastik short sofa will give you a back ache. Hilton should be embarrassed! I've slept in other suite's sofa pull outs that are so much better. There also isn't one comfortable chair in the two rooms. Also if breakfast isn't included, head to the  Westin for fresh baked goods, or cross the street down to the Pantry for your cereals, milk, juices, sodas and frozen goods (microwave in room) as well as liquor items. Basically its a standard hotel, standard service but a block from the Mag Mile, close to the bus line - cant be beat!",3
204,"I stay here about ten days a year. They are human, they make mistakes. They also do thier best to make things right when they do. Good rooms, some nice views, and right next to all the mag mile shopping. The bar downstairs has gone down hill in the past year though, not the place to go anyway.",4
205,"Okay, this is a toughie... because the hotel itself was pretty nice, and definitely a convenient location, pool/hot tub/sauna, comfy beds... the problem really came to the service.  The rooms were not cleaned until late afternoon/early evening. Not really a problem, just later than I'm used to, and really we only needed some necessities replaced. However, towels were not replaced (even after calling to ask for new ones). Toilet paper was not stocked (we assumed there'd be some somewhere in the room if they didn't replace the empty roll... we were wrong). When we asked for a mini fridge to be brought up to the room, we were told it wouldn't be a problem. It never came and we had to call 3 times before it was finally brought up to the room. We waited nearly 30 min for valet to bring around the car after being told it would be 15 min... normally I'm patient, but when given an expected wait time, I tend to count that it's accurate. It only made things worse when we were completely ignored while we were waiting. It would have made things slightly better it some one would have at least come up to say 'we apologize for the wait.' (One last side note on the cleaning, on the last day there, on doing a final check of the room to make sure everyone had their things, I discovered a random shoe of unknown origin... just one... who knows how long it had been there).  Overall, it's a nice hotel, and -very- convenient. Just be prepared for repeated calls to get what you want.",3
206,"This hotel is in the perfect location--next to the John Hancock building and one block from Michigan Avenue.  We booked this hotel through http://Priceline.com and got a fantastic deal for a weekend in June!  We arrived during a torrential downpour and the valet and doormen were right there to assist us with our bags.  We arrived a couple of hours before check-in and were told our room wasn't ready (we were sopping wet and had to hurry to make it to the Cubs game), but the couple behind us got into their room.  We didn't think too much of the front desk staff, not the friendliest.  The doormen and valets were excellent, however! We were very surprised at our room!  We loved that it was a suite with a frig and microwave.  It had a TV in the living room and bedroom.  We had a great view on the 24th floor, too.  For an even better view, go up to the pool on the 30th floor.  You can see for miles and miles up there!  My husband loved the Precor ellipticals in the fitness room. No free breakfast and even a Nutrigrain breakfast bar cost $2!  We didn't go to the restaurant or bar, so I can't comment on that.   I would highly recommend this hotel, and we have stayed at quite a few downtown hotels!",4
207,"Overall clean, great price, and location.  Great views from the workout areas and swimming pool.  Very nice having a separate living room.  However the parking is crazy for $52/day (park in one of the nearby garages for $26-33 instead) and the hot tub needs cleaning/renovation - lots of black grout.  The drop-off area is very congested with taxis.",4
208,"great price, excellent location, rooms were ideal given the cost and comparable rooms at local hiltons... didn't have time to check out the gym",4
209,"I loved this location... It was prime.  I always love being in Chicago, but the smaller hotels are usually easier accessible to the busy spots. The decor was beachy, very non-urban, but I liked it as it gave me ideas for my Miami condo which I'm redecorating! (go figure, get the idea from chicago) The poorest possible thing was the front desk.... One guy, sweet but not quick at all was manning a manic line of check ins... There was a sign for IHG Elite members but nobody was there to work it... I liked my place there, especially the awesome upgrade to a suite, made a huge difference... Loved the chic Indigo vibe... Pricing was average.",4
210,"The good and the bad.... Pros -Hotel is in a good location. Residential area. I felt safe walking alone outside the hotel. -The beachy/nautical decor is cute! Felt like i was at a beach house w/o the beach.. -Room was clean and the bed was VERY comfy! Couldnt get out of the bed in the a.m. LOVED my room on the 10th floor. -On the 10th floor, the shutters opened to a view of downtown -Most of the staff was really nice! -Lobby/Bar area is really cute -FREE Wi-fi   Cons -My friend didnt specify a preference and ended up on a smoking (4th) floor. The hotel was completely booked so she couldnt change. As soon as the elevator opened on her floor it reeked of smoke. Im not a smoker so it was completely suffocating for me when i visited her room for 5mins. She stayed 3nights and was completely miserable. (MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY) -The lady w/ the long dark hair was rude. -Ordered room service (the croissant sandwich) for bfast and it was absolutely horrible. Bacon tasted like rubber..Couldnt finish it.. -Cabs rarely come in front of the hotel so you'll need to walk down the block to Division (not far.. just inconvenient) to catch one. -Several bars, a Starbucks, & Walgreens in the area but not many good food choices... we cabbed it to other areas.",3
211,"Man, this place is really mixed. I'm giving 4 stars purely on value, bed comfort, cleanliness, and nice staff. If this place were a $1 more expensive, it would easily fall to 3 stars. OH, now the front entrance will make you FEEL like you are at a Hotel Indigo, but once you enter the elevator, it gos downhill from there. For a Hotel Indigo, lets get this straight, the decor is disgusting and flat out OLD. The floors are old, the paint and carpets are old. The showers also do a pathetic job of keeping water off of the shower floor (There's a very small amount of glass coming from the wall an the curtain will not help you cover the gap). You will be using extra towels to mop up the water spraying out. The bed was Hotel Indigo standard. Lush, comfortable, sheik, and of course covered with some of the most heavenly pillows around. The place is CLEAN. The staff here is also pretty amazing.  If someone could just remove the staff and beds, and then blow up the decor with something new (WITH new flooring) and the place would be legit. Still, for $155 including vallet parking with unlimited 24 hour entry/exit, the deal is pretty hard to beat. You can get great deals if you call the Hotel Indigo reservations squad directly as opposed to going thorugh an online broker. When calling in, ask for any room/parking special rates.",4
212,"I don't usually result to Yelp but after attempting to contact the manager of Indigo and not receiving a return phone call, I am actually taking the time to write this in an effort to save others from this uncomfortable and somewhat bizarre experience.   I happen to be a physician as are my siblings who were also staying at indigo.  I'm only mentioning this because I feel like the cost of wouldn't be such an issue for me if it didn't seem like highway robbery.  One of the nights cost 200$.   The reason it feels like I was taken for a fool was because the staff was so rude.  It almost seemed like a joke.  I kept looking over my shoulder to see if there was a camera crew.  When I would go to the front desk to ask a question, the woman working made it seem like I was bothering her.  At first I thought maybe she was having a bad day until the same cold shoulder attended to me when I had the misfortune of requiring front desk services.  When I tried to relay an issue I was having with parking, she requested that i sign a valet parking receipt that didn't have my name on it .  The next day,  I brought to her attention the fact that she had charged me for 2 more days than I had utilized. She still seemed bothered and definitely did not apologize.   Did I mention it was over 100 degrees and only one elevator worked. not for one day. or two.  It didn't work for 3 days.  I understand things happen, It seems that in the business world there is some sort of compensation.  or at least an apology. Speaking of apology.  The valet driver allowed me and my sisters to get into a car that was not ours.  Sure it was the same make and model, but when we finally realized that the car wasn't ours,  we quickly exited the car, informed the attendant who responded, 'I know.""   Aside from that",1
213,"This was a last minute weekend to downtown Chicago, I prefer boutique hotels over large big box hotels. I found a great rate on Expedia $180 per night and their website looked like a place I would like so I booked it. I was pleased when I arrived, my room was ready, staff was friendly and the entire hotel was clean. I loved the beachy decor, made me think I was out in California by the ocean. About my only complaint was the laminate flooring in the rooms, it was a little warped and looked cheap, otherwise the furnishings, bedding and other amenities were nice and upscale. I will keep this hotel on my short list for future trips downtown.",4
214,"For the price and location, this is a great hotel.  It's quiet and clean and all of the staff is professional.  It feels like a beach house in the middle of a concrete jungle but it was always comfortable to come back to, especially the gas fireplace. For tourism, it's only about a 10 minute cab ride to just about anywhere you want to go and any landmarks/museums you want to see.  I would absolutely consider staying here on a future visit.",4
215,"I booked the room through priceline which was an excellent deal for what I received. This is definitely a boutique hotel with chic nautical charm... not what you would expect to find in chicago's Gold Coast. They have a restaurant and in room dining after 5pm... pricey but the salmon was great. My room had a stand up shower with no tub so if you need a bath tub, I recommend asking for one. They offer both smoking and non smoking rooms. The non smoking room I was in dId not smell like smoke at all. They have free wifi and cute rooms but have out dated television sets. They carry Aveda bath products, keurig coffe in the room and the beds are pretty comfy. Don't drink the bottled water in the room, that will run you $4 a pop (what!?) But chicago boasts some of this nation's cleanest water straight from the tap. They also have a fitness and buisness center. The staff is wonderful which is why all the stars. I feel the staff really makes a place feel more like home away from home. If you need a cab to come get you use American united taxi... (773) 248-7600",5
216,"What a cute place! I was completely caught off guard by this classy, boutique hotel nestled in the Chicago Gold Coast. And speaking of coasts, this place had an uncanny resemblance to Alexander's Guesthouse on Key West. Hotel Indigo was VERY beachy, but also quite classy. Backwards script discussed ""phi"" along the walls (luckily, I can read backwards), which I thought looked cool but was weird (why was it backwards?). We approached the counter and the two men stayed near the back and glanced at us with a silent question in their facial expressions. ""Can we check in?"" That's when they jumped to attention. Weird that they didn't make the first move. The entry area to our room was the best. There was a small foyer area with a long table and mirror. To the right was our bathroom and the bedroom was to the left. The floors were ""wooden,"" and the walls were a pretty periwinkle with green accents. One wall had enlarged pictures of mussles. The view from our window was to a fire-escape with a brick wall beyond (not the beach I expected). Other things to note: - Aveda soaps/lotions/shampoo - comfortable bed - tube tv - unpopulated bar - breakfast place also seemed unpopular (there's a great breakfast place just two doors north of the hotel) - free wifi - we could hear other guests down the hall, but not loud enough to be bothersome",4
217,"I needed a place to stay after moving out of my apartment on my way out of town for a new job.  I lived less than a block away from the Hotel Indigo, and with the Ambassador East under renovation, it was really the only choice in my neighborhood. The normal rates for this place are nuts - $180/night.  If you use Hotwire or Priceline you pay at least half that, but keep in mind you lose the ability to choose your bed type or smoking/non-smoking preferences.  I was placed in a smoking room - at the front desk, they cheerfully told me I could ""upgrade"" to a non-smoking room for $75/night (which basically nullifies the rate I found on Hotwire), and when I showed no interest in that, they brought it down to $40.  Since all I really needed was a bed, and a place to bathe, it wasn't the end of the world, and I declined all their upgrade offers. My room faintly smelled of cigarette smoke, and I could barely even notice it.  The hallway, on the other hand, had a noticeable odor.  Thankfully my room was near the elevators so I was exposed to that for only a few seconds. The room was adequate... I wouldn't define it as tiny but it might feel that way if two people were in the room.  The seashore motif was not that annoying.  The bed, however, was on wheels, and would start rolling away from the headboard (wall-mounted) which was very cumbersome.  Also, a large wooden tray with glasses and an ice bucket is on the bed and there really isn't any convenient place to put it when you're ready to lie down. In terms of other room features: the TV was dated (LodgeNet?  I had to laugh at the welcome screen's voice-over actress: Canadian - ""Welcome to Chicag-OH, and thank you for staying at Hootel Indig-OH"")  but I definitely enjoyed the Keurig coffee brewer, with a cup of tea at night before bed and a cup of coffee first thing in the morning.  The bathroom was only a shower, with a strange showerhead that I eventually figured out, however all the fixtures were new, and the Aveda bath and body products were a nice touch.  The front desk staff were smart enough to give me the WiFi password when I checked in - I always hate getting to my room, pulling out my laptop, and having to call the desk to get the password. That said, the only problem I really had was with the lack of bellhops.  Normally I wouldn't need any help with my luggage, but since I was moving I had six pieces of luggage.  When I arrived, they didn't have anyone available immediately.  I waited about 15 minutes.  (The nice gentleman at the front desk literally had an aneurysm calling for assistance on the radio multiple times.)  The morning I left, I called early and gave them a half-hour's notice that I needed some help.  Nobody showed and I had to take care of everything myself - I was taking an airport shuttle and couldn't risk missing it. All in all, it was a decent place to stay, but just remember, if you book through a discounted booking site, you're not going to get a lot of options from this place.",3
218,"Stayed here for six nights with 5 other coworkers for a tech event with Chicago.  We are all in our late 20s, and we felt like this hotel was not for our age group.  Almost everyone there looked over 50, and the decor is a very cheesy nautical theme, and we joked to people we met at bars that we were staying in a retirement home. Also, we pretty much all found the front desk staff pretty unhelpful.  When we were checking in it seemed like they wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible, and when we asked for them to call a cab in the morning, they called one and said that we should wait fifteen minutes outside, but it might never come.   We paid $179/night during the week and about $250 for the weekend.  We went to the ""Pump Room"" for drinks, and wished we had stayed there.  It was reasonably priced and very classy because of a recent remodel.",2
219,"Huge fan of this hotel!!  Does it have the biggest and best rooms I've ever stayed in?  No.  But what it does have is the best staff ever!!  Tom at the front desk was awesome!  I booked the hotel through Hotwire but because I am a Holiday Inn rewards member I got 2 upgrades...yes, that's right...2.   Parking is high but that goes with the territory.  Awesome location, we walked to Mag Mile and to dinner each night. I personally loved the decor, although I know it's not for everyone.  Shower had good pressure.  Beds were comfortable.   Will stay here again in a heartbeat!",5
220,"Hotel Indigo is an upbeat hidden jewel in the sometimes stuffy Gold Coast hotel district. In the earlier half of 2006, (while most of my friends and I were still trapped in the burbs) we'd frequently look to Hotwire to find a hotel when a friend's couch was unavailable. On St Patty's Day weekend in 2006, I ended up booking a room at the Hotel Indigo for a friend, myself, and any others that should straggle back to our hotel that night. When we arrived we were taken aback by the look and feel of the lobby. It felt more like residence than a hotel. The decor seemed a little more personal as if someone had built the room piece by piece. The elevators were the old style kinds with grates and although quite sound (they weren't rickety) they slightly triggered my fear of suspension. Truthfully, it could have been that combined with one of my friends jumping up and down once he realized I wasn't a fan of elevators. Ass. The hallways are brightly painted, but not done so that it appears tacky. Again, I felt like I was visiting a large home more than a hotel. This feeling was magnified once I saw my room. Although it had the same 2 beds/mirror and sink combo/separate shower and toilet room setup as most hotels, it felt like a bedroom. I tend to prefer neutral colors in decor, but somehow all the oranges, blues, whites, purples and yellows worked together. Dare I say this, but this is just a damn cute hotel. Unlike previous reviewers I didn't get the beachy vibe as much as I felt cozy and comfy. The staff was also very friendly. We didn't take advantage of room service, but they did look the other way as a bunch of 23 year olds checked in 15 additional guests (my friends are poor planners!), 3 24 packs and a visible beer bong. They were equally as non observant when we boisterously arrived (half of us on piggyback) back at 5am. Hey - St. Patty's fell on a Friday that year. I'd definitely recommend Hotel Indigo for visiting parents (I have a feeling that most mothers will adore the setup) or a nice couples getaway if you can't particularly get away from the Chicagoland area. Hey, sometimes it's nice to shake it up. The location is walkable to many attractions and the Clark/Division (Red Line) and Division (Blue Line) stops so if you can pry yourself out of bed (that bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in) almost anything in the city is mere few footsteps away. I posted a few pictures from that weekend to show room decor. You're going to want to keep in mind that this was St. Patty's Day.",4
221,"I would stay here again for two reasons:  the staff and decor.  The front desk concierege were able to help us find a place for breakfast and hailed cabs in the blink of an eye.  I especially love the saltwater taffy at the front desk.  No crummy mints here.   I love the bright, yet calming seashore themed decor.  You forget that you're in the middle of downtown Chicago.  You can leave the metropolitan Gold Coast and step into your own seashell.  I really felt comfortable here.  How often do you hear ""outdated decor"" in reference to a hotel?  Not here.  No way.  Very chic, very relaxed.  Worth every penny.",5
222,"I snagged a great rate on Hotwire to stay at the Indigo for one night on a recent stay.  The location was very convenient from Midway airport.  I hopped right on the orange line, transferred at Roosevelt to the Red Line, and walked from the Division stop.  Very easy!  I also liked the neighborhood, which was a more upscale, residential part of Chicago I hadn't seen before.  I felt safe walking here by myself after dark.  It is also a few steps from the Third Coast cafe, which is one of my new favorite places in Chicago. The rooms at the Indigo are brightly colored and I couldn't help but get a little giggly at the boardwalk decor.  It was slightly on the schmaltzy side, but I still liked it.  The bed was comfy and the room was larger than I expected. I would definitely stay at the Indigo again, especially if I can get a good rate.",4
223,"Eh. I wasn't impressed during my recent stay at the Hotel Indigo. Oh sure- the location is great- just blocks from Old Town, and the lake. And the bed was comfortable. And the price was okay at $172 for a king room. But this place, while it calls itself a ""boutique hotel"" lacks the service and amenities of a true ""boutique hotel"". The front desk check in was a hassle, and the staff was unconcerned about the wait and as I stood there- I watched them deal with other guests in a nonchalant way that a true ""boutique hotel"" would not. Hotel Indigo looks it was decorated from Ikea with it's bright blue walls and green and white striped accents with simple wood furniture. I don't know if they were going for a beach theme but that's what it reminded me of. The room was tiny- so much so that the bed took up all the space and you bumped into the wall to get into the even tinier bathroom.  Maybe there are better rooms in the hotel so if you go- don't get room #514! But the real kicker here had to be the tiny bar in the front lobby. I went down to have a drink and the bartender told me that they didn't have much liquor. What? She then held up the vodka bottle and swished it around so I could see that there was barely a shot left in the bottom. When I asked her about it (knowing I was staying at the hotel with people who like to drink) she just shrugged and said an order must not have come in. Really? And there is no where in Chicago to buy some liquor to take care of your guests? Parking runs $36 per night at the garage next door (that's another review but the headline is- if you can find another place to park you should go there) All in all- I guess Hotel Indigo is fine for a basic hotel stay but I hate that they promote it as a ""boutique hotel"" for along with that label comes certain expectations. I won't be recommending it to any of my friends who come to town to stay. For the price- there are lots of better choices.",2
224,"I have been wanting to stay at Hotel Indigo for quite some time now. Last weekend my best friend flew into town from Scottsdale, AZ - Gave me a great excuse to finally check this place out 1st hand. Pros: 1. - LOCATION! - Could walk to Old Town, State/Rush for night life, the beach, even to downtown if you have your comfy shoes. 2. - Decor! - Loved it! - Very unique! They are so proud of their decor, that even have a page in their hotel booklet of things in the room you can take home with you as a souvenir, and how much each item costs. I'll tell you what, that gave us a good laugh!!! 3. Have Aveda Products in the room, that was nice to use instead of typical generic junk. 4. Staff was great! - Very friendly! Cons: 1. Overnight Parking - $36.00 2. Save $40.00 and book online with Expedia/Priceline. I called in the reservation and they added all these taxes and fees that otherwise would not of been there. So I got SCREWED with the bill at checkout. (That $$ otherwise would of paid for the parking.) Would I go there again? Heck yes! - Great for girls weekend!!!! Partied 'Vegas' style!",4
225,"Super precious hotel. Loved it. Will be my 'go to' hotel from now on. You heard it here first. So, I cannot stand downtown Chicago (i.e. magmile and all other typical touristy spots) so this offered a perfect location to the neighborhoody side of Chicago. It was less than a 5 minute walk to the lake, an easy easy walk to shops/eats etc, and was located on the cutest tree lined street you've ever seen surrounded by breathtaking homes. I was in heaven. The hotel was super clean and our room #701 was a corner double room with beautiful views to the homes below and I could even see the lake! It let in amazing natural light and honestly felt like my own little chicago apartment! I didn't hear a peep minus the loud girls next door who finally shut the heck up at 4am. The beds were comfortable enough, the hardwoods were great, and the room in general was spacious and so adorable. A few notes: Remote didn't work. Light fixtures were totally whacked up. And the bathroom was teeeeeny tiny. Annoyingly tiny. The rooms are showing signs of  wear if you care enough to look. I notice details because I'm anal like that, but otherwise a really really great place to be. Did I mention there were huge freakin blueberries on the wall? Cuteness overload. P.s. The front desk/entrance area smelled like vanilla. Perfect.",5
226,"I stayed here for two nights over the July 4th weekend, and I was very impressed.  The decor is kitschy but not over the top, and the rooms were great.  For the price we paid (I think it was about $300 for two nights, so about $100/person), it was a fantastic value. The rooms are pretty big and look like you're in some tropical resort.  The beds are really comfortable and you couldn't hear noise from outside or other rooms at all.  We got there much earlier than the posted check-in time (we took a 7 am flight from Boston) but we were able to check in, go to our room, and leave our luggage with no problem. This hotel is in a nice neighborhood, and it's really convenient--walking distance to many attractions, a few blocks from the Red Line, there's a grocery store and drug store (the drug store sells alcohol) a few blocks away, and there' s a Starbucks right down the block.  Bonus points for that, I need my iced mocha in the morning!",5
227,Cute theme hotel we were on a board walk themed floor it may not be there as they were remodeling when we stayed wouldn't mind seeing some of the other themes clean rooms and comfy beds and we were in town for a conference so were quite tired when we got in every evening and lots of pillows yaaaaaaa !!!!!   Mr Gyro is just around the corner nothing like buy one get one free Gyro's there is a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts both with in a block of here and a drug store so you can get sodas and stuff forget paying for stuff from the honor bar just use it to keep your stuff cold and when ever you needed a taxi or anything it was real quick to get one,4
228,"I'd absolutely stay here again! The rooms are small but the fun, bright decor makes that ok. The service was wonderful - I called down for toothpaste and within 10 min I had toth paste, a tooth brush, and an assortment of other goods. The room was clean when we got there and housekeeping kept it tidy when we asked for it and stayed out when we asked for that too. I can't say much for the food but the menu had all the standard stuff. The location is really great. Instead of feeling like you're in the middle of a city, you get a sense for what it might be like to live there - the surrounding streets turn into a farmer's market on the weekend. You're in walking distance to the red line and a short stroll to the Miracle Mile, Gold Coast, etc. Oh, and they give you free internet. woohoo!",4
229,"By far the cutest hotel I have ever stayed in.  This is the perfect girl's night out hotel.  I hosted a bachelorette party a while back, and I reserved a few rooms here for all of our out-of-town friends.  I discoverd the hotel while jogging one day, I lived right down the street at the time, so I got the neighborhood discount.  The rooms were set up so perfect for her pre-party/personal shower.  There were plenty of space and seating for all of us.  I came in early and decorated, it looked really nice.  Everything was clean, and comfy.  Our view was pretty cool too, we were nextled amongst the city buildings.  Our out-of-town friends loved it! If I did not live here, I would stay here everytime I was in Chicago.  The lounge in the lobby is perfect for cocktails, and the ambiance is amazing. P.S. The pictures shown for this hotel are NOT of my group of friends.",5
230,"We stayed at the Hotel Indigo during our first visit to Chicago (7/6-7/10/09). The location was very close to the upscale shopping of Michigan Ave and the John Hancock Observatory. And much to my surprise, it was a short walk to the beach area located near the Drake Hotel. I enjoyed the neighborhood feel of this hotel. I didn't feel like I was really in the city. The rooms were very spacious and had lots of natural light. The hotel decor gives it a beachy feel.  The beds were very comfortable and the common areas were kept clean. I believe this hotel accepts pets as the room next to us had a dog. My only gripe is the lack of ""cheap eats"" in the area. I used yelp a couple of times and found a great breakfast spot not too far from the hotel you have to check out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/…. Other than that, you won't really find any ethnic foods, especially the kind I'm used to living in the SF area. I would definitely recommend staying at the Hotel Indigo for your first visit to Chicago!",4
231,"My wife and I live in Chicago and we were looking for a 'get-away' in the city for a night for her birthday.  After playing roulette with Hotwire and receiving Hotel Indigo as the inexpensive boutique hotel in the Gold Coast area, I have to be honest and say that I was little disappointed based on the photos.  It seemed like it was a little out-dated/tacky for our taste, but we made it do. When we arrived at the hotel, everyone was extremely friendly and they even went above and beyond by adding a little romantic touch to our room when we arrived late at night.   If you're looking for a good/clean inexpensive place to stay and you can look past some of the 'disney-esque' decor, then I would definitely recommend this place for you...Just don't use the parking garage next door- it's valet only, overpriced and they only have two men working on weekend so we waited over half an hour for our car.",4
232,"Really liked the pineapple stools at the bar in the lobby and the saltwater taffy. Beautiful decor, but the nautical theme didn't fit the location. Parking garage is conveniently next door. Smoking. Can smell it in the hallway. Would I go back? No. 1. Booked a king, but got a queen 2. Price of parking was absurd. 3. Size of room is pretty outrageous, expected in NY, but not Chicago. The windows looked out into the back of the building next door. 4. Overpriced 5. Lobby doesn't offer coffee.",2
233,"I LOVE staying at this hotel! The beds are always amazing and the staff is wonderful. Tom checked me in on my last trip--super nice guy who offered me a room even though it was prior to check in.  He said if I didn't like the room I could wait for something else. Room was spacious and beautiful, but no view...and when I'm in Chicago, I need my view. Tom got me into a smaller room with great views of the Sears tower. Totally happy. Internet was included--yay--and if I have any complaint, it's that the parking is tough in that area and valet is too rich for my blood.  I go here because it's cozy and friendly and makes me feel at home...i do not go there because the rooms are big. Its one of the best boutique hotels around and the location is second to none. Forgot to say...the above and beyond part was the fact that I was STARVING after traveling all day and could have eaten my shoe, I was so hungry. When Tom saw me eyeballing a plate of cookies and cakes (a staff reward for their high accolades on TripAdvisor) he kindly offered his cupcake to me. How nice was that!",5
234,"It's okay.  I booked Hotel Indigo on Hotwire for just over $80/night after taxes and fees (it's a 3 1/2 star hotel in the ""Gold Coast"" area, if you're looking to Hotwire it..), and it was a decent place to stay. Like everyone else, I can't help but be confused by the beach-ish theme. Coming here in the dead of winter, it seems.. incongruous at best and somewhat taunting at worst. Smallish rooms, but clean and well-appointed. Free WiFi. The location is good, definitely in a cooler, hipper, more residential area than Mag Mile or Loop hotels I've stayed in before, but the hotel itself if nothing spectacular. Free caramel Andes candies in the lobby. I doubt I'd pay full price for it, but - like nearly every hotel I Yelp - it was a good Hotwire find.",3
235,"Ok but can it be better in the Gold Coast!  I love the cute decor in the place.  The theme runs true throughout the hotel.  The room was definitely cozy and reminded me more of a bed and breakfast than a hotel.   The place is nestled right off the lake.  I was thinking it should be a bit more opulent but its okay.  One thing that I appreciate is free wifi in the rooms.  It makes a heck of a difference when you are trying to get work done.   The price was okay but make sure you check out http://hotels.com for great discounts on them before paying a hefty price. The service was moderate.  At times, you could miss them.  However, the morning time is when they flourish with many greetings and ""hello, how are you doing today""! It's worth checking out.",3
236,"BIG FAN of this hotel.  Super close to EVERYTHING.  In walking distance to Michigan Ave food and shops.  3 minutes from the Red Line.  3 minutes from the little Irish-bar area.  Very friendly staff - the airlines threw our 3.4 oz toothpaste away and we got a new tube quickly.  We got lucky with an amazing view, as they put us on the 11th floor overlooking the city.  The rooms are a bit small, but it wasn't a big deal at all for us, since we spent all our time out and about in the city.  And I love any place that has FREE WiFi.  Many many thanks for not nickel and diming people. For anyone looking for a great hotel, close to everything - Hotel Indigo is definitely a good one.  I'd stay here again on my next visit.",5
237,"The Hotel Indigo had a piña colada feel, with a smoothie-shop-decor, and the lobby smelled like coconut lotion. When hotwire notified me that I had made reservations for the hotel Indigo, I went to check it out on-line. The pictures scared me a little. I thought It would be too girly or cutesy for me. I was prepared to not be amused by this hotel. Once I arrived, It wasn't as bad as I thought... It was kind of cheerful. The service: was ok, nothing to complaint about or rave about either. No stars there. The room was one of the smallest rooms I've had in Chicago. But it was neat, clean and had everything I really needed. Nice small room, with a small window, but for the price I paid it was ok. Loved the location. Good restaurants, shopping, and the beach are all so close. Just take Division and it takes you right to the beach. After a long night out, my friends and I came back to the hotel area and decided to go to the beach and see the sunrise before calling it a night. It was a nice thing we could do since the hotel was a few blocks away. It was a nice hotel to stay at once, but I think I saw other 'nicer' hotels around that area that I might want to try next time I visit Chicago.",3
238,"I've stayed here about 10 times over the last few months, and will continue to stay here. The hotel is a bit outside of the loop, and it can be difficult to catch a cab occasionally in the morning. Great on-site fitness center, with multiple nice machines, 2 treadmills, a bike, a stair stepper and a small selection of free weights. The staff is friendly, although I've had very little interaction with them other than check-in/check-out. Rooms are clean to an 8/10 - some mildew spots on the ceiling of my shower last night and there are little details here and there that should be tended to, but good overall. Would like coffee in the lobby, but that would take away from their little coffee shop at the back of the hotel. There's a Jewel-Osco grocery store around the block if you like to buy groceries (no fridge or microwave in the room though), and the CTA Red line is around the corner also if you prefer to catch the train to downtown rather than cab. Jim & Colette http://www.roamingtogeth… http://www.facebook.com/…",4
239,"Holy neon colored walls! Five stars for the comfy beds and being a short distance from Lake Michigan and the Magnificent Mile. Three stars for those awful neon colored walls that are supposed to create a ""breezy beach"" theme (in the middle of Chicago?). Three stars also for the terrible room service food.",3
240,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Indigo.  The staff is exceptionally kind and attentive, very welcoming. The bed was REALLY comfortable, and the space was fantastic - particularly for the price point.  Nearby there is a very nice grocery store, a Starbucks, restaurants, and the red-line train is only about 3 blocks away.  Plus, it's a simple walk to Michigan Avenue for anything you could ever hope for.  The unique decor was much more soothing in person than I anticipated by the photos.  It actually works. I liked the fitness center, and the attention to small details. The internet connection worked perfectly and was complimentary! Very quality experience.  Definitely staying here again when I'm in Chicago! I'd like to send a particularly warm shout out to Victoria, who was the best of the best and very helpful.  To the management: GIVE VICTORIA A RAISE.",5
241,"Got this hotel through price line.  Good location for what we needed and parking next door.  Cute, but very small rooms.   We got there early and told that our room would not be ready until at least 3 or 4.  We had to be ready and leave by 3, so I used the lobby bathroom to get ready.  We were sitting in the lobby waiting for them to tell us our room was ready.  After I got ready in the lobby bathroom, my husband went up to the gal again to ask her how much longer.  She had a room for us right away.  Ugh, you saw us waiting and me running back and fourth to the bathroom to get ready.  So, we went up and put our stuff in the room and left.   Bed was comfortable and the bathroom is stocked with the usual.",3
242,"Decent enough hotel for the price, maybe a tad rough around the edges. I wouldn't normally have chosen this place, but I won 2 nights in a silent auction, and I spend another night here during a long weekend trip.  Conveniently close to the Red Line, but there's nothing in the immediate area that I found particularly compelling or fun - unless college dive bars are your thing.   I didn't eat here, so can't say anything about the food.  The hardwood floors aren't such a nice selling point in the middle of winter.  Housekeeping skipped our room one day, but the front desk graciously refunded 50% for one night to make up for it.",3
243,"My neighbor told me that you offer a neighborhood rate so I called and asked about it.  Not only did I get forwarded to a different person after the receptionist couldn't answer my question, but the guy who answered was like a robot.  He not only made it sound really complicated to get a discount as a local, but he kept trying to change the subject by telling me about the hotel.  I just wanted to know the bottom line and STILL don't know the answer to my question.  Pathetic.  Maybe the hotel stay would have been better but the robots get in the way.",1
244,"This is the gussied-up version of the former Claridge Hotel. It proclaims itself as a boutique ""lifestyle"" hotel. This is a fine and colorful addition to the rather staid and laid-back Gold Coast neighborhood.",4
245,"I want to check back in, and crawl right back into their bed sent from cozy heaven. Best night of sleep I've ever gotten in a hotel. The comforter is just heavy enough, the sheets smooth enough, and the pillows soft enough to sleep for 12 hours straight. (I wake up from anything) Our room was also in a weird corner nook, which may have had something to do with it being wonderfully quiet. Try to book in a _11 room. Unlike the Nashville Indigo, I think the hotel got the design better here. It feels much more peaceful, and the room layouts make more sense. As for the ammenties, the hotel has a gym and spa services. Indigo isn't stingy about towels either, which is a star in itself. I also liked that there were video games, and the tv remote was a Nintendo controller. The staff was nice, but the garage (owned by the city) is run by a real asshat, and it was 30 something a day for the PRIVILEGE, plus they demand you valet. BAH!",4
246,"Wound up at the Hotel Indigo through Hotwire-what a great surprise.  Rooms were very comfortable-awesome beds. Nice decor, hotel staff seemed to enjoy there jobs which translated to being friendly. Great location.  Looking forward to going back next week.",4
247,Well it turns out that my wife was super allergic to the laundry bleach that the hotel uses called Ecolab Destainer and now she is heading to the doctor. The great discounted room sucks!,1
248,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights recently.  I am a business traveler that just relocated to Chicago and needed a place to stay while I was waiting to move into my apartment.  I stayed in many different hotels before moving into my place - Swiss Hotel, Marriott, Hyatt - all downtown and I have to tell you, they really depressed me.  Maybe they are geared for the business traveler and not a pleasure traveler, but God, I hated those places.  So I decided to try something different and got a boutique hotel in the Gold Coast which is how I ended up at Hotel Indigo.   Wow, what a great little place.  I looooved it.  Loved the hotel and really loved the location - tucked in on a residential Gold Coast street.  The decor is bright and you just feel happy as soon as you walk in.  The decor is mainly blues and greens - very bright and beachy - it would really be a great place to stay in the summertime.   Anyway, the people were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms were big and bright and nice and the location is to die for.  You can walk to shopping in the Gold Coast, walk to the beach, walk to Old Town, you can even walk to Lincoln Park and the Zoo if the weather permits and you have comfy shoes on.  And forget all those places above - you can just walk around the neighborhood and take a look at all the gorgeous old greystones and brownstones and have a great time.   Highly recommend.  And check out Priceline and Hotwire - they have this place listed at times as the ""secret"" 3.5 star boutique hotel in Goldcoast/Water Tower area.  I got a room on Hotwire here for $109 a night (usually their rates are $275 and up).  What a steal!",4
249,"We stayed for a week and were very pleased with the location of this hotel. Easy to get to anything we wanted to do. Lots of places within walking distance. The train is within a couple of blocks and is easy get anywhere. Convenience stores, restaurants and night life close by. Hotel is located in a nice, safe residential neighborhood . The staff was very attentive and helpful. We did not even bother with a car the whole time as it was not needed.",5
250,"I found this place online while looking for a good rate for a bachelorette party for my girlfriend.  We loved it.  The colors are bright and cheery, the beds were SUPER comfy and the staff was really nice.  It was also ridiculously convenient (literally half a block) to the Gold Coast bar scene, which is where we were headed for the party.  We wanted local Chinese takeout and the staff was really nice about giving us menus and recommending somewhere local.  We called and asked for more towels (there were plenty for two, but not for the four of us) and they were brought up immediately. Parking was $39, which is pretty reasonable fr 24 hours downtown. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to a friend.  I'm not sure why people complained about the ""beach theme"" - I liked it and I think it would be welcome in the bleak Chicago winters especially!",4
251,The staff at this hotel are mighty nice in a genuine way. I think that it must  be a midwest thing because I found that across the board with the general folk too. Check in was a breeze and we were quickly whisked up to our room. At the time we were both smokers so I had requested a smoking room but OH MY! The smell of the ciggie smoke in the hallway just gave me a good ol' one two punch in the nose! It was like a smokers convention had just left the hallway. The room on the other hand had a great themed decor of being at the beach/boardwalk. It was a great and up lifting feeling being that we stayed there in the middle of February and just in time for a big winter storm. The bed was very comfy and like Robert S. said lot of pillows which was a good thing for me cause I am the Princess of pillow hogs *evil grin*. Oh the hotel is located in the Gold Coast residential area which is an upscale area with condos and brownstones. I didn't feel unsafe at all during the entire trip coming or leaving the hotel. I'd highly requimend the hotel to woman or young ladies who are traveling on their own. I'd stay here again if the price is right. Unfort the hotel can be pricey at times so be ready to pony up for a room so I've had to stay at other hotels :(,3
252,"My husband surprised me with a stay at Hotel Indigo for the weekend. First, I have to say that this is a good hotel for a weekend getaway but I would not reccomend it for a long extended stay, since there is no closet space. I loved the lobby, it had a modern pallete and is scented based on the season. The scent was pineapple for the summer and it was just so refreshing. The front desk staff always remembered us and always said hello to us, which is a nice change from large chain hotels. The room itself is cozy, but I loved the king size bed and the great comforter that was on it. Also Aveda bath products were a plus. The few cons I have are the shower curtain never seemed to keep the water out. They really should just put a shower door. The air conditioner was either really cold or not cold enough and it was a bit noisy. The ice machine is on the 2nd floor and when I went, it was out of ice. I called and they brought me a HUGE bag of ice (way more than any one person could consume, so I had to put it in my sink), but they were quick in bringing it. Last, we said we were staying for our anniversary and they really didn't do anything for us. I don't expect anything, but always give props to hotels that go the one up. Also, since it is a boutique hotel, I would have thought that they would have done something special for us. I would definitely go back for a weekend getaway.",4
253,I loved it. The staff was friendly and helpful. One of the highlights is the pool on the roof. Great view of the Sears (willis) tower. Restaurant in the lobby sucks so stay away. Not a 4 star hotel but I came for work and the 179 a night was the cheapest in the area and it was very nice for that price,5
254,"I recently came to the city to do House Hunting for work and because nothing was preferred with my company in the area, I chose the Holiday Inn as I have always been happy with their service; however, there is a first time for everything. I will start out with the good: - Beds are super soft - Wireless was fast and had a good connection - Close to Clinton Blue line Now the bad: Before taking a shower, I noticed that there was shampoo, and two bottles of lotion. My companion called the front desk to get some conditioner thinking the maid just mixed up the bottles because they look similar. Within minutes (good) a man was at our delivering four bottles. However, upon inspection we saw that it was two shampoos and two lotions. We were a bit mystified and wondering if you could use lotion for conditioner all rational thought says no, so we called the front desk again proposing the question. Her response was rather rude as she stated lotion was lotion not conditioner.   Next, the walls are thin. We could hear everything going on in the hallway as well as the neighbors coming back in their drunken stupor at 4 am. Not to mention because the hotel is located close to the interstate and subway, there is a lot of noise at night. The hotel parking is not free. There is a $35/day charge but you can get it for $25 if you sign up for something for free. There is a parking lot located below that you can pay per day but it was very sketchy. As we were walking to the subway, three men were hanging in the area and yelled very rude comments and six hours later when we returned they were still there. I am glad I was not alone as I did not feel safe. No complementary breakfast Finally, there was no refrigerator or microwave so I could not heat up my amazing leftovers from Artisan catering!   Final Review: This place is not worth it",1
255,"Booked a two bed standard room only to arrive and find they only had a single bed bedroom available (wish I'd known this before I booked the room for $200 bucks!).  Manager told us that they would inform our third party booking site (Expedia) that they wouldn't charge us since they didn't have the kind of room we wanted.  Instead they informed the site that we stayed in the room for 2 hours (instead of 5 minutes) and that they will not refund our money (wish they would have told us that before we left!).  All we wanted to do was stay in the room with TWO beds that we booked.  Be careful when making reservations, as what's advertised is not necessarily what's available.",1
256,"Traveling with kids!  Loved the rooftop pool, rooms were a little small but clean and beautiful with very comfortable beds, close to plenty of attractions, lots of public transportation.  Great staff",4
257,"This would not be my choice of hotels when coming to Chicago, but it is my companies choice. I will admit it is close to work and convenient to mass transportation to get to the locations I prefer socially, but let's talk about this hotel. Let's Make a List: 1. Good location, close to Union Station and mass transit. 2. Friendly staff and very good customer service. Always remember me. 3. Bed was very comfy, love a firm mattress. 4. Close to main highway could here traffic outside, but can still sleep. 5. Bathroom is postage stamp size. Had to close door to get in shower. 6. Restaurant off lobby is average. It's Italian, but they do breakfast too. 7. Free internet. Big plus for me. Can't be without my computer. 8. Green friendly. You can opt not to have sheets changed everyday and to use the same towel for a second day. 9. Nice fitness center. If your business is in The Loop and near Union Station, this is a good choice. My company knows a good deal when they find one.",3
258,"It a relativity a well kept hotel and the staff are very accommodating.  It is however just another Holiday Inn...nothing out of the extra ordinary to mention.  However, there is a lot of family staying so it is loud and usually have a lot of kids running around. The restaurant needs a little work, it just a pizza place that attached.",3
259,"Ehhhhh.  Extremely noisy, curtains were completely ripped up, weird rust-colored (blood-colored?) stains in the tub, semi-questionable neighborhood, and ""valet"" parking is a complete joke (don't pay for it, just park in the adjoining lot for half the price).  The staff, however, were incredibly friendly and helpful, much more than you would expect given how shitty the hotel looks, hence the 3 stars instead of 2.  That, and it's very accessible via both public transit and the interstates. I stayed at this Holiday Inn because they were the only downtown hotel I could find that had a room and parking package that was within my per diem, and that will be the only reason I ever stay here again.",3
260,"With conventions in town, and my company asking me to stay longer, the Holiday Inn @ The Mart was booked.  So I had to switch hotels today. This Holiday Inn is located about 2 miles from The Merchandise Mart, very close to the Sear's Tower. It's pretty tiny and out of the way.  Not conveniently located to anything walking distance. The service is decent.  The view from the hotel is atrocious... It's actually costing me $220 a night to stay here... I'm glad it's only for 3 more days. One good thing... they also have free wireless here and since they have less rooms, the wireless is less used and it's much faster than the other hotel. UPDATE: I just woke up from my first night's stay...and I have to give 1 more star! These beds are SOOOOOOO comfortable.  Much more comfortable than the other Holiday Inn.  The pillows are VERY soft... I love this bed!!!!",4
261,"I will NEVER ever use travelocity's secret hotel application even if my life depended on it! Travelocity rated this hotel with 4/5 stars, which is pretty high since other hotels such as Inn of Chicago, Allerton, Drake, etc are also rated 4/5 or higher. The lobby was very VERY tiny and full of kids running around. The front desk personnel was helpful and friendly; she was very helpful and answered all the questions I had. I had booked a ""secret"" room through travelocity and luckily it ended up being a king. Upon entering my room, I noticed it smelled like wet towels that have been laying there for days. The room was rather small and the lights flickered. The bathroom took up 1/3 of the entire room! There were weird stains in the bathtub and the towels smelled like straight up bleach. There was a giant crack in the wall near the window (EEEEK!!!) Usually at other hotels, you can control the temperature in your own room. Not this hotel apparently. The AC kicks on whenever it feels like and every time it does, its so loud that your forced awake. It usually turns off by itself after a few minutes to let you fall asleep and then the cycle begins again! I paid an extra $30 a day for valet parking. To be honest, I was rather surprised this place offered that service to the guests. However when I asked for my car, the valet just simply handed me the key. I paid $30 for them to HAND me my key??? To make matters worse, it took me 30 minutes to find a cab in downtown Chicago around that area. The next morning, I woke up to what sounded like construction drilling. I checked out VERY early. I checked online and apparently, a room at this hotel for the night will cost you around $185!!! I only paid $75, but had I known, I would have gladly paid the $150 to be on Michigan Avenue. Overall, this place was a mess. I did like the customer service at the front desk; they were very polite and helpful. Other than that, the entire hotel is a giant dump that is not even worth 2 stars let alone 4/5!",1
262,"I hop around all of the IHG properties in Chicago while I'm staying here for work, and the Holiday Inn on Harrison came due. The location isn't dreadful, but it certainly isn't close to anything.  There's a Panera, Whole Foods, etc about a 6 block walk, but in January winter and 5"" of snow, count me out.  If you have a car, then life is good, otherwise plan on taking a cab to everything. Great fitness center on the top floor, all health club quality Precor equipment, a great multi-machine, and dumbbells up to 50lbs.  Kudos to the General Manager for making the investment here. Rooms are good, very much Holiday Inn but clean and what I need.  I was upgraded to a suite #437, and it's more space than I live in on a daily basis, and has a microwave, fridge, and a flat-panel TV although I don't watch it. Front desk staff is friendly, although check-in took a little longer than I would like due to several people all at once. Room is surprisingly quiet since it's so close to the freeway. Great looking business center on the top floor, looks more like an internet cafe than the typical hotel business center - very nice. I see other reviews talking about the tiny lobby.  I use the lobby for checkin and checkout and don't hang out there, so it's small size doesn't bother me.  I did not experience the families, although I'm also not here during the high season. I did not try the pizza joint attached to the hotel, it has looked pretty empty every time I've passed by the window.  If the GM or anyone from the hotel reads the reviews on TA - The WiFi is pretty slow, and could use a bandwidth upgrade.  Find out whatever the Crowne Plaza on Huron has, and make the investment into the same pipe.  It would also be nice to have coffee in the lobby.

263,"This relatively new Holiday Inn is conveniently located not far from Union Station, the Greyhound terminal, and the Clinton ""L"" station on the Blue Line. The facilities are decent enough, but you will be hearing the roar of expressway traffic here.",3
264,"Excellent price, great location (right next to John Hancock building), very nice and spacious room, free internet, and excellent service - this is the place to go if you don't want to go broke while staying in Chicago hotels. I recommend it to my friends who plan to stay downtown and will most definitely return any time I have business in the Loop.",5
265,"As a single traveler (well, OK, I do have my teddy bear with me), it's hard to sometimes find cost-effective hotels to stay, especially in city centres. I've become more discerning in deciding the important things in a hotel over the years I've been traveling. Where I used to prioritise a swimming pool and not swim, I now look for proximity to public transport and an internet connection. Seneca Suites is an older hotel reflected in its dark wooden decor but its location a block east of the Magnificent Mile is its outstanding feature. It's 4 blocks from the Chicago Red line station. My room was huge - separate bedroom, living room and kitchen. Teddy and I could almost have a room each! Although I ate out on this trip, the kitchen would certainly allow self catering to cut down on costs. I didn't suffer the problems mentioned in other reviews - the water was hot for my showers and the decor wasn't worn out. The free wifi was fast and reliable. There were 2 big TVs with a great range of channels - yup, I was stuck on the Food channel most of the time. Seneca was a bargain for this part of town",4
266,"We booked through Hotwire and got an amazing deal on a suite with a full kitchen, sitting room, dining area and most importantly for traveling with family, a real wall and door to the bedroom.  The living room was so spacious, we even had several local friends over for drinks before going out, or down as we first stopped at their wonderful little wine bar and bruschetta place in the basement.   They are updating the rooms but if the grandma style decor (China press with blue china monkey) is part of the low price we had no problems.  The staff was really nice and helpful with old school service like bell hops and door men.",4
267,"Dark but larger rooms in an older converted residential hotel. Bathroom was tight. Had a suite, though never sat in the dark LR. Tiny functional kitchenette, full fridge, lots of small closet space, king bed. Nice location at $160 a night. Relatively clean and quiet. Great for couples or small families on a budget. Money you save on groceries will pay for the $160 room rate.",4
268,"Sorry but I feel I have to update this review.... I've now been staying here nearly two weeks and I have had precisely one shower that was hot. No more, no fewer. I don't know how the heat distribution works here but I would've thought that they could channel some of that energy expended on making the corridors into saunas (seriously I have to wait until I'm in the lobby to put my coat on or I'd boil in the lift) into heating some frickin' water. Secondly, my TV does not work. I only discovered this tonight as I had previously been too embarrassed to ask how to turn it on (it wasn't plugged in, but there were two wires and I followed the wrong one and... it's embarrassing, I confess). I was right to not ask because the front desk man was rude and unhelpful and told me there was a switch and there wasn't. The TV sounds like it's got some doppler effect going on, but I'm sitting still. Sometimes there is no sound. SOMETIMES THERE'S LOADS. I don't even particularly want to watch some strange show about tim roth reading the body language of psychotic criminals (can someone tell me what that is??) but at least if I turn it on I'd like to hear all of it or none of it, not half of it. If you open the fridge just once, it hums all night. I think it's to keep the dripping tap company. Again, rant over. I'm still giving it three stars because I understand it's bloody good value and having just got out of the cold shower, talked to a rude man and turned on the broken tv, i'm not in a very objective mood. but really. no.",3
269,"I'm surprised this hotel got such great reviews. I suppose my experience wasn't bad but it certainly was not 4 stars. I must have gotten a non-renovated room because it was really small, dingy, the hair dryer didn't really work and everything inside was a little on the small side, all these small nooks and crannies made it uncertain what exactly it was I was supposed to use. Overall check in was easy, check out was easier. They held the bags on the last day since my flight out wasn't until late. The place was mediocre priced but for the room and the amenities that I received, I would have expected it to be even lower. The location is great but sort of overshadowed by the Hancock building. It's easy to get taxi's from this area as it is right near Magnificent Mile. There was nothing bad about the stay, but it was definitely unimpressive and could have been better in some ways taking note of the price. I will probably hesitate to stay here again unless I get a killer deal.",3
270,"I found this place through yelp and I am so thankful.  This place is really sweet and nice.  I was in Chicago recently for a conference on green building.  There weren't a lot of hotels in the immediate vicinity of the conference center and we were booking our hotel much too late to get the normal hotel spots.  Initially, we were looking at some other places.  I yelped these places and saw that they were often no good.  Some had mold issues or poor service or whatever.  Not this place.  It feels like an old apartment complex, slightly worn but cozy at the same time. The service is great.  Things aren't luxurious by any means but you cannot beat the location and the price.",5
271,"Rate, location, security and staff were better than the vast majority of hotels I've stayed - which is bunches - I travel for business A LOT. For those that base their vacations on room decor, we may not see eye to eye. I couldn't care less about it, but to describe the room best I'd say  the decor was far from cutting edge (just shy of tacky yet nondescript), the room itself was big and comfortable. It could use new carpet and updated bedding but it had a nice desk, couch, king bed, 3 closets (seemed odd, but whatever) and a kitchenette that was really cutely tucked away within the room. I was very surprised to find a full size fridge, small sized stovetop oven (not that I needed it, but if I were coming over from Europe or anywhere else I'd be very psyched for that as a bonus). We did hear about other people with air conditioning issues with their room; we were totally uneffected. Just in case the room influences that, #1012 is a safe bet. At 129/night, I felt it was a bit of a gamble given this hotel's prime location literally behind the Hancock and kitty corner from Water Tower. You could practically throw a rock at either. I'm originally from Chicago and recently moved out east and was back on business for a week. Trust me, hotels in that location cost at least double. People who live on that block spend more money on their dogs than I will make in my lifetime. This hotel is easily 100/night less than counterparts in this neighborhood. Shopping is pinnacle Michigan Ave, and Oak Street beach is easily walked (a couple blocks). A few things you might not know (if you aren't from there): A neat place to grab a drink is the Hancock. Instead of the observation deck, go up for a cocktail and have the same view while having a nip. Also, on the 600 N. block of St. Clair (about 3 blocks South) is a great little italian place called Coco Pazzo Cafe. Reasonable prices, outdoor seating and outstanding food. If you ask the concierge about it, be sure they direct you to the St. Clair location and not Hubbard (though I'm sure it's just as good, it's not within walking distance). Two more things! Something that really caught me was the security. Nowhere that I've stayed in Chicago has had key entrances near the elevator bank. I thought this feature was a cupcake. Something all the downtown hotels should have everywhere! It gave me an extra bonus sense of security. Lastly, the staff was super friendly and efficient. We left the ""do not disturb"" sign on our room when we went out for the day and when we got back to the room we had a message on our phone from the head of the cleaning staff letting us know, in the most pleasant tone ever, that they had not cleaned our room so as not to disturb us and to call them if we needed anything(!). In fact, from arrival at the valet, through checkin and at checkout, all staff members were just that - super friendly, and most importantly, efficient. I agree with another reviewer that said this hotel was neither romantic nor trendy, but if you're looking for an attentive, quality hotel experience while adventuring into Chicago (especially if you're interested in the ""mag mile""), don't hesitate.",4
272,"I recently stayed here, mostly due to a fantastic deal I found on hotwire.  For the price I paid, it was certainly sufficient, but the rooms definitely could stand to be updated.  Beds were very uncomfortable, especially the pullout sofa bed in the king suite.  Tiles in the bathroom were coming off of the wall, and all appliances in the kitchen were very outdated. The service, however, was excellent.  I interacted with 3 or 4 different people at the front desk during my 2 night stay, and every single one of them was courteous and friendly.  They don't offer extensive concierge services, but they are able to book architecture boat tours through Wendella, which is nice to save you the hassle of getting to the ticket office early and booking a tour. Overall, it's a fairly no frills place but with a very friendly staff.  My main goal in booking was to get a cheap hotel near the mile but without visible bodily fluids or rodents/cockroaches.  Thankfully, I avoided that, but the rooms still could use a face lift.",3
273,"""Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: 'Is this the condition that I feared?'"" - Seneca the Younger, Ancient Greek Philosopher While Seneca's meditations on the ills of material wealth are inspirational and thought-provoking, they do not give you much solace when you are staying at a hotel which provides fare which can best be described as scanty and cheap.   The service was no exception.  Just one example: I had a reservation for a queen bed, which they would not change to two doubles.  When I arrived, I had in my room what was clearly a full sized bed (smaller than a double sized bed).  When I asked for a room with a queen, or in the alternative, a rollaway bed, the lady at the front tried to argue that it was indeed a queen bed in my room (without looking at it) and refused to bring even a rollaway without a $50 fee.   Seneca would have been proud of the Seneca, but I certainly am not.",1
274,"I stayed here during the summer of '11! It was a fantastic hotel. The restaurants included were also delicious. Although, the breakfast staff were a little rude. However, the staff at the front desk were amazing and so helpful! This hotel was right in the heart of Chicago. Lots to do and lots to eat in walking distance. Very clean!!!",5
275,"We recently stayed at the Seneca for two nights during the week. We got a decent deal online, which is why we chose to stay here. How to describe the Seneca...well, it kind of reminded me of grandma's apartment. Nice, comfortable, functional, but kind of old school. In fact, I believe the rooms are converted studio apartments. At least ours was. The kitchen was fully functional.  It had a refrigerator, range, microwave, plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. etc. The bathroom was very small, and again resembled and apartment bathroom...not your typical big hotel bathroom. The furnishings were also nice, just dated. Other upsides of this place... The hotel staff was very nice The location is great, just east of the John Hancock So if you are looking for romantic or trendy, this is not your place. But if you want functionality, the Seneca definitely fits the bill.",4
276,"A gorgeous building with beautiful rooms, some in semi-vintage styling.  I had the pleasure of staying here while attending a research conference...

277,"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Seneca on New Year's Eve last year. Now, neither of us are fans of NYE--in fact, we *hate* it--but somehow, The Seneca made it so much better. We booked it on priceline or expedia and for $80, we kind of half-expected it to be a little divey, but this place is definately worth every star. It's in a great location, the hotel is absolutely beautiful, the rooms were great, and the best part about them was the little kitchenettes! Awesome! It made for a New Year's Eve fun-filled night of cooking microwave popcorn and baking cookies! I heart you, Seneca.",5
278,"Lucky us, the Seneca overbooked and we were put in the Presidential Suite!  SWEET!!!!!! Excitedly opened the door...  DRIP!  What the...?!  I was scared to call for fear that they'd move me into a regular room.  Instead maintenance was sent and fixed the drip (coming from the AC) in no time.  NIIICE!!!!!!

I hosted my wedding party here during the big weekend, and I thought it was fine then, but my subsequent stay has dashed those initial impressions.  My list: Pro - The Internet actually works decently, although still not terribly fast - Location is great, just off the north end of Michigan Avenue, in a quiet area Con - You MUST ask for a renovated room or else it will be horrible - My bed was U-shaped - TV was grainy and about 18 years old - Build-in kitchen was not very functional, and the refridge was very loud - Headboard moved all over the place at the slightest touch - Sheets were thin - Bottom sheet was not fitted and moved all over the place - Pillows were thin - One of the lamps initially did not have a bulb",1
281,"A thin veneer of elegance fails to conceal a lot of sloppy upgrades over the years.  Many fixtures in the room were loose (power outlets falling out of the walls, bathtub faucet flopped around), and the furniture was worn.  Understaffed, had to wait unacceptably long to check in due to a guest in front of me having a complicated issue and no other front desk being available to assist other customers while it was resolved.  That said, the room was clean, the location excellent, and we got a great mid-week deal.  Good for the budget-conscious traveler who's not looking for any frills.",3
282,"I stayed here upon my arrival when I relocated to Chicago. Heres my .02 for what its worth. My disappointment was that for the money the room was a little rough.  Nice, comfortable, functional, but kinda rundown . In fact, I think the rooms are converted studio apartments for business renters.  The kitchen was fully functional.  It had a refrigerator, range, microwave, plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. etc. The bathroom was very small, and lit very badly. The furnishings were also nice, just dated . On the upside, the hotel staff was very nice. The location is great, just east of the John Hancock. Great starting point for any Michigan Ave. day adventure. So if you are looking for  a hotel room with  functionality, the Seneca definitely fits the bill.",4
283,"When I choose a hotel, I look for value, cleanliness and location. The Seneca Hotel offers all three points.  For the location (a block off Michigan Av), other hotels in the area could not match the price of a room for the week-end I needed for my visiting relatives. The room, however outdated and somewhat dark, was clean and had a small kitchenette. The staff was friendly, the bellman very helpful. There are a few parking garages close by if you do not choose to use the hotel parking overnight (saving some money).",4
284,"Stayed here with boyfriend in the middle of March2011.  I have to say, this place is awesome, especially if you get a good deal on the rooms.  It is a hotel and apartment building.  It is right next to the Hancock Building, which is right on Michigan Ave.  It's easy to get to the bus/eL from the hotel.  Our room was not what I was expecting, it was totally awesome.  They appeared to have been all apartments at one point, so it was like having our own apartment.  Had lots of storage space, full fledged kitchen (that we didn't get to use), huge bed, nice sitting area and tiled in bathroom.  I really loved this place and I plan on staying here in the future.",4

288,"I am in Chicago for an interview and decided to stay at the Seneca because you can not beat the price. I am staying here for 89 bucks a night for 4 days and it is well worth it. My room is huge. It has a living room, kitchen and two closets. Now from what I have seen this is not a normal room. And I asked at the front desk if there is anything special with my room and there isn't anything. I just got lucky. If your coming to Chicago and you want to be close to Michigan Ave but you do not want to spend a lot, then you should check out the Seneca.",4
289,"The Seneca is pleasant.  Not outdamnstanding, but pleasant.  My room was basically a one bedroom apartment.  The bed was comfortable. The furnishings were okay.  I would have given this place four stars, but for one thing.  The bedroom window treatments consist of miniblinds and sheers.  In the middle of the city, this means you will be bathed in city lights all night as you are trying to sleep.  They need actual light-blocking draperies. Really.  It's such a simple fix.  Why don't they just install drapes?   If you don't need darkness to sleep, then this is a reasonably priced place to stay.  Otherwise, you might be better off going elsewhere.",3
290,"For the price, this place gets five stars! I was blown away by the quality of this hotel and would easily stay here again. PROS -The size of the room was enormous. Giant queen bed, great desk (fantastic, because I had a ton of work to do), enormous closet, bathroom, fully stocked kitchenette with stove, sink, dishes, pans, even a colander, fridge and freezer. Where else can you find that? -The bathtub had a whirlpool!!!! There was also a hairdryer and working heater in the bathroom. I experienced no problems with having tons of hot water for baths and showers. -Two free continental breakfasts. They weren't amazing, but they weren't Costco danishes either. Ham, two eggs, toast, hash browns and coffee. -FREE WIRELESS! And the wireless customer service was great. -Fantastic service all around. They helped me when I lost my key card, remembered me when I came back in and opened the security door for me without my having to swipe my card, gave me a wine bottle opener, let me chill in the lobby, use the internet and do work for two hours after my checkout and were just very helpful and polite. -Quiet room. I had to record several interviews out of my room and each time the audio came out great. CONS -The shampoo and conditioner wasn't great (but then again, is it ever?) A light burned out and so the room wasn't well lit (but I didn't call down to notify them, which is just my laziness.) I also can't judge how good the gym or sundeck were because I was too busy the whole time.",5

Gave me an incredible suite with kitchen and great view. The breakfasts were great (and free). My girlfriend and I both absolutely loved  the location to everything she wanted to see. There was a problem with the parking garage they had just started using, but the hotel manager walked with us down there to not only correct the problem, but to not use them until they worked out the kinks.",5
292,"we stayed at the seneca for a mini staycation this past weekend. the front staff upgraded us to the presidential suite, which was really nice. fully functioning kitchen, small dining area and a living space in addition to our very large bedroom. the only drawback was the teeny tiny shower, and the equally small jacuzzi tub. im about 5'8, and couldnt stretch my legs out in the tub.  the shower had weak water pressure and the head didnt have a knob to change the pressure. we had limited interaction with the front staff, but the check in and check out went smoothly. i would stay here again, but the bathrooms need some improvement",3
293,"WATCH YOUR WALLET!!!! THEY OVERCHARGED ME 3 TIMES.. DO NOT GO HERE!!! I live on the west coast and only see my parents 2 times a year. I met them in Chicago for my Dad's birthday and wanted to be nice and pre-pay for one night of their 2-night stay. First, there were problems with billing over charging me and customer service BEFORE we even arrived for our stay. I called four times to the hotel to ask about the charges and no one ever got back to me until i had to go to the website and write a comment. I spoke with Director of Operations who really did nothing to apologize for the mistake or make any attempt to rectify the situation. When I asked for my parents to be compensated for one of their rooms for one night during their 2 night stay I was told that it was a ridiculous request and it was the equivalent of ""asking a mechanic making a car payment for you because you dinged your car"". Instead I was told he would think of some way to make it up to my parents when they checked out on Sunday (which never happened). They credited my credit card for the amount they overcharged me so I still paid for one night of the 2 night stay. When my parents checked out on Sunday, November 14th, not only were they charged for 2-nights, but for 2-nights worth of parking for 2-vehicles. My parents only had one vehicle. The Manager that was on staff spoke with my parents and told them that I was never there to sign for the charges to my card and therefore I was never paid-obviously a lie. By the time that everything got cleared up with the parking and a few other problems with the other rooms under my mother's name- the manager offered to take off the charge for one of the nights of their 2 night stay (exactly like I requested but was denied-again an unreasonable request). My father asked for a receipt and documentation which the Manager reluctantly gave him. So now for a THIRD TIME we are being overcharged. I already paid for one of the nights of their 2 night stay yet my parents paid for the same night since they were given the second night stay free. We will never be back to this hotel again it was a horrible experience even BEFORE we arrived and you had another chance to improve customer service during our stay and failed.The only genuine apology I received was from your accountant. You have a great facility and it is a shame that it is not run properly.",1
294,"The Seneca is my new home away from home in Chicago.  The staff was welcoming, professional and positive.  I believe they actually like working at the hotel!  Patrick at the front desk let us check in early and seemed very happy to do so.  Thanks!  The room was on the 9th floor, and was quiet and beautifully appointed.  The beds were superb.  Everything was immaculate.  There was a full kitchen, which we did not use, but would be very handy for some folks.  The shower was luxurious and bath products were provided.  Check out took no time at all.  The lobby is reminiscent of the old time luxury hotels.  It was small, but beautiful.  The location, as other reviewers have pointed out, was simply unbeatable.  Check out Francescas's restaurant next door.  Excellent Italian food and good prices.  The theatre is across the street.  We saw the play  ""Working"", which I would highly recommend.  For you American Girl Doll fans, the store is right across the street, next to the theatre.  Michigan Avenue is steps away, but you are shielded from the noise at the Seneca.  We'll be back!",5
295,"We stayed at The City Suites Hotel in Chicago this past weekend.  The hotel is an older building but the hotel is actually quite nice. We had the suite with a king bed and in the other room a pull out sofa. We had 2 LCD TV's, a table with 4 chairs, small frig, microwave, and a fully stocked bar. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was very clean (and I mean CLEAN) and the bath had everything you needed. The staff were very nice from the person who took our reservation, the desk staff, and the housekeeping staff. All of the employees made sure we were treated well. There is even a continental breakfast that is free--not many offer this in today's economy. Across the street is a diner that is open all night long if you feel the urge to eat. the hotel is on the Brown Line which will take you to the Orange Line (in the loop) then to Midway. It takes 1 hr from the hotel to get to Midway. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. RM",4
296,"City Suites is a fairly small, but affordable, boutique hotel. That said, I think boutique is just fancy speak for old. It's not that things are run down per se, it's just definitely not modern and has some quirks as a result. My room was spacious enough, had two mini fridges (one empty, and one filled with reasonably priced beverages and snacks), two LCD TV's and a comfortable bed. However, it also had uneven floors, older furniture, noisy steam heating and certainly didn't do a lot to absorb outside noise. Overall, friendly staff, free continental breakfast (though pretty bare bones), somewhat slow Wi-Fi, and a great location - coupled with affordable rates, it's not a bad place to stay.",3
297,"Just returned from an over-night stay with my husband.  The location is great.  Right near good food and entertainment.  That is probably the only upside to this hotel. The hotel itself is old and outdated.  We could actually feel holes in the floor boards through the carpeting.  The bed was super uncomfortable.  Not old, just bad.  The TV in the bedroom only had intermittent reception.  One draw back to the location is that it is right next to the Belmont stop of the EL.  All night and especially in the morning we were awoken by the train rumbling by and the voice ""This is the Belmont stop, the next stop will be..."". Lastly, even though I made my reservation well in advance and had requested a king bed they had none available and we were forced into a double bed.  While I love my husband I was looking forward to just a bit more space.",2
298,"It's an old building. Noisy radiator heat, and one thing that bugged me, is that the dorrs are stiff and don't auto-close. I came back to my room multiple times to find it OPEN. Not cool. It's discrete but I'm not sure it'd be a good place to hook, as it may leave several clients feeling exposed. You must walk down a very long hallway to the reception desk.",2
299,"So I was a little skeptical about ""The City Suites"" since there was mixed reviews on the various sites around, but it was to where I wanted to go and none of the reviews I read contained neither the word ""junkie"" or ""prostitute"" like some of the other hotels, so I decided I would give it a shot. Checking in was a speedy process in which we were given the skinny about the parking (less than a block away), check out time (11 AM), and breakfast (7 - 10). The first clerk was ok, not terribly friendly, but not rude or hostile. Our room was a nice surprise. The bedroom was separated from the living area, which was nice. The bathroom had checkered tiles on the walls with cubed windows which added more character to the hotel room . The room was very clean and fully stocked. The only downside to my stay was slow internet speed. When I spoke to the first front desk attendant, he seemed to have the attitude that everything was fine and I just needed to deal with it. Which is an OK answer for me. But, the evening manger Jeremy was very informative, telling me that the hotel was fully booked, he already had contacted ATT, and I wasn't the only guest to have mentioned this. That's how you handle a complaint. Jeremy the night manager was very courteous, funny, and informative. The hotel rooms are very descent for the money you're paying, but the service from the staff and attitude of the staff is what really makes you want to come back for another stay at the ""City Suites"".",4
300,"I was pleasantly surprised by City Suites. It has an amazing location, right by lots of restaurants and bars. It took us 10 minutes to walk to Belmont Harbor! I was a little freaked out at first by the proximity to the Red Line station. You can hear the trains all day and night, but I got used to it pretty quickly. Inside the room, the bed linens and amenities were nice. It had a fancy tv and a very well stocked mini bar. They also have 24 hour coffee/tea in the lobby and a nice little continental breakfast. There was also no problem with an early check in as we arrived a lot earlier than anticipated. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating (nice to look at too)!!! The rooms are pretty small which is standard in big cities. We didn't have a lot of room for our luggage (I did overpack though). I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and will be staying here when I return to Chicago.",4
301,"This hotel is not a five-star hotel. BUT for the 5 days/4 nights I stayed here it definitely was a five-star experience. The hotel is quaint, boutique-like, and very european. Our room was small and the bathroom was very clean and very art-deco. We didn't need much room as we spent most of our trip out and about. The staff was awesome! Friendly, we never were disturbed, and were even granted a late-check out free of charge. LOCATION was perfect! One couldn't have asked to be any closer to public trans, dining, and nightlife. This hotel is located at Clark/Belmont, borders Wrigleyville, and Lincoln Park. The price was good for what we got. Everywhere else in Chicago was atleast 250$/night. We were here over St. Patrick's Day weekend ( a blackout wkend for most hotels) and paid under $200/night. My boyfriend and I plan on coming back to Chicago when the weather is better and we definitely will be returning to the City Suites.",5
302,"Either everyones standards are really high or mine are just dirt low but this place was great.  I dont think I could have stayed about a better hotel.  Sure we looked at the really sweet 5 stars downtown and couldnt afford them due to non ballin'.  But hey... This place is close to everything.  Right at purple belmont.  Close to food, shops, bars, PIZZA. Staff left us alone the whole time which is a big plus.  Russ hooked it up several times. Small rooms but that is all you need.  It was clean warm and the bathroom had a window facing Belmont.  It was great and we will be back.....",5
303,"Being a bridesmaid is a rough life.  Drinking, party games, pretty dresses... I know, I know... you should all cry for me.  There are some hard parts, including staying in a hotel in your own city which boggles the mind a bit, but with a lot of out of town ladies, you roll with the punches and have a blast.   The lobby was small and odd, and for some reason the glass case full of examples of minibar goods cracked me up, but the stay was really a pretty good one.  Our room was big enough for five overnight ladies and a few other pre-dinner party game participants and all the gifts and luggage, and other junk that comes along with a mostly out of town bridal party.   There were many nice touches from the bellman's offer of wine glasses when he noticed we had champagne with us, to the heated bathroom floor, to the extra mini-fridge, not just a minibar full of overpriced crap.  The other great thing was the free continental breakfast which was perfect as we had a long day ahead of us, and many hours before the rehearsal luncheon.   We chose this place for its proximity to our other bachelorette destination and the comparably reasonable prices.  I'd recommend it to people trying to avoid the hubbub and high prices of downtown.",4
304,"Let me start with the most important part of my experience at City Suites:   My boyfriend, who's black, was greeted by one of the front desk staff with a cold stare and a stern ""What floor are you on?"" a couple days into our stay.  When he told the attendant our room number, she mumbled something about a guest's missing property.  We still can't figure out what she meant, but I think you get the point.  In 2009, in Chicago, we had hoped for better. Here's the other critical part of our experience:  Anyone who says you can ignore sounds from ""El"" trains next to the hotel is lying.  The noise in rooms is brutal.  You hear everything -- trains pulling in and out, conductors' voices, door-closing chimes.  We also woke up to construction outside our window from 7am both weekdays of our stay.  Rooms don't seem to be soundproofed, so sounds almost seemed amplified. Some less important points, but equally unpleasant:  Housekeeping was lazy, leaving towels strewn on sofas and cabinet doors. I've never stayed in a hotel where the cleaners didn't return towels to the bathroom, or just replace them. FInally, the property's in poor shape.  While the lobby's clean, the facilities in general feel more ""hostel"" than ""hotel"". Bottom line:  I'm staying at the Days Inn next time I'm in Chicago.  Better value, better location, better hotel.",1
305,"It's great for cost-effective, clean accommodations. A few annoyances though. We were right beside the elevator, so we'd hear the tone of the Elevator arriving at our Floor at all hours of the day/night. If I was ever doubtful of Obesity being a problem in America, I certainly don't now. There were 3 individuals with a combined weight (roughly) 900lbs staying directly above us. We could hear them waddling around quite frequently. Fortunately, they all couldn't move very quickly at the same time, so it wasn't that much of an annoyance. But I did hope the Building was up to Code, for fear of being crushed in our sleep. The Continental Breakfast was pretty shiete. Coffee terrible in the lobby. But, that's really not why you stay at a Hotel. For a Clean, relatively quiet, fairly cost-effective place to sleep; it's great. Next time in Chicago, I'd probably stay here again.",3
306,"I recently stayed overnight at the City Suites. It was chosen due to the close proximity to the point of my visit to Chicago. I could not have got more lucky! So close to so many restaurants and shops, and as many have mentioned, the subway. Again not for light sleepers! The staff here was so helpful and really accommodating of all of my random and somewhat demanding requests. The rooms and common areas are clean and well kept. One of the nicest hotel bathrooms I have ever seen! The lobby was so quaint and throughout may stay had guests just relaxing & chatting by the fireplace. My first choice for a hotel in this area and I will be back.",5
307,"City Suites is simply awesome. Quaint, friendly, safe and with a delicious and fully stocked continental breakfast, this is one of the most conveniently located and accommodating hotels I've ever stayed in. There are a lot of restaurants and cafes around the area so you're set to eat/buy anything you might need. The front desk people were usually all friendly (especially the guy who works the graveyard shift. We loved him!) The shuttle drivers who were taking us back and forth from De Paul were also so friendly. The rooms are great and the beds come with lots of pillows (not sure why that's so fun to me but it is). The hotel has Wi-Fi (score! though it can be slow sometimes) and fortunately we were on the opposite side of the train station so didn't hear the opening and closing of the doors every five minutes. They have nice cushy bathrobes and nice smelling lotions and shampoos--good quality ones that you wish were a take home size! The only annoyance was that eventually at night the room overheated to feel like a sauna. And because the windows couldn't open I had to turn on the A/C to balance out the Mojave Desert. There's only four floors to the hotel (and only three people to the elevator) so if you want to have a more personalized experience City Suites will suit all your needs. The downstairs common area is so nice and they've got a fire going most of the time. So sweet. And there's always coffee and tea out and sometimes a basket of cookies. I don't think I've ever had a hotel feel so much like a cozy home.",5
308,"The location is great as it's just a skip downstairs to grab some grub at Ann Sathers & it's in the middle of a fun shopping area.  Also close to the eL, which is sweet. The rooms, while clean, are rather small, though ... it was hard to manuever my parents, brother, & myself, so the kid stayed with me instead. Pricy for the room size, about right for the location.",3
309,I am not sure that the people who wrote the four and five star reviews of City Suites actually stayed here. I will say that the staff is exceedingly friendly and helpful and that the 24 hour coffee in the lobby/living room is nice... But you go to a hotel to sleep. And at this hotel sleep is hard to come by. The main problem is noise.  The walls are thin enough you can hear your next door neighbors TV.  The ceiling creaks from the upstairs occupant just walking around.  And I had the misfortune of staying in the room opposite the elevator so every time the doors creaked open you felt as if people were coming into the room.   I give one star for service... one star for cleanliness... but the stars for comfortable and a good nights sleep I have to withhold.,2
310,Nice quaint non chain hotel right across from my favorite club Berlin. It's always been my favorite place to stay at since all I have to do is cross the street and I'm snug in my non chain hotel exceptionally comfortable bed. It is on a busy road near the El if you are a light sleeper be aware. But the location is unbeatable.,4
311,"Boyfriend had some vacation time so we decided to head to the Windy City. My aunt, who lived in Chicago for a few years, suggested this place to us due to location. Right next to the Purple/Red/Brown lines at Belmont which was super convenient for us since we had some downtown/Loop business. There's tons of great shops, restaurants, and bars around. I'd recommend this place for any tourist. There's a Walgreens nearby as well as a liquor shop (since a lot of restaurants are BYOB). Tons of great stuff nearby! We got a standard queen which was real small. It was okay for us since we live together, but if you're looking for a little more room than just a bed, desk, and bathroom then get a suite. The bathrooms were updated and very nice, not to mention it was great to unwind in front of a flat screen after running around. Although the room smelled a little like hamster bedding for the first two nights. We didn't hear the El at all, but I did hear the elevator, people walking on the 4th floor, and the annoying, awful screeches of a child in the room next to ours. Quit beating your kid, you're on vacation! The staff was really friendly. I had an anxiety attack coming into Chicago and the boyfriend was kind of flustered with where he was at, so we called and John stayed on the line with us the whole time to make sure we got there ok. One of the guys working there could tell I was upset and he made sure to try and cheer me up which was nice. Free tea/coffee 24 hours, free breakfast (but Ann Sather's is a walk down the street... ;] ), and we always got buzzed in after 9pm since they remembered who we were. I'd definitely come back here again.",4
312,"This is a great hotel if you want a small,"" Boutique Hotel"" experience in the Lakeview area with decent staff.  This is Not a great hotel if you want a good nights sleep, however.  Being near the Belmont red line station, I expected the usual city noise. However, it was the noise from other ""guests"" that was the problem....Walls very thin....could hear loud voices from across the hall, constant elevator activity, and tv from next room.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find a nice hotel in this area, so I think it is worth it to stay downtown, and take the el.",3
313,"My fiance and I were going to a concert that started at 10, and didn't want to bothered driving back to the suburbs, so we hopped on priceline and got a great price for a room here! The staff was super friendly and the room was lovely. Before we went out, we relaxed in bed, watched some TV, and hopped on our laptop using the free WiFi. Previous reviewers have mentioned the sound of the El, which we noticed, but I guess are used to from living in a noisy downtown area. This hotel was right around all of our favorite spots to shop and eat. Awesome! The bathroom (and entire room, for that matter) was clean and well taken care of. Our room was small, but the bed was comfortable. We both had a great night's sleep after coming home around 2 AM.",5
314,"I got a great rate for this hotel on Priceline and I really wanted to like this place for the deal I got. AND in all honesty we should have said something to the management the second we realized what was going on. So we get checked in and everything, the hotel is really convenient and I really like the placement as it was really close to everything we needed to go to.  It was a cute hotel and our room was a little small but hey, it worked for us. The issues first started happening when I tried to connect to the wifi in the hotel.  I couldn't get it in our room and I was frantically trying to do something on the internet when I couldn't get to the internet.  I walked down to the lobby and accessed it there.  I soon found out from my bf that we could get it out in the hallway outside of our room but not in our room.  Okay it's an old building I can deal. Then they had window units for the AC in the room.  Yes, I know it's Chicago but come on.  It was fine the first couple of days cuz it was cool outside but when it heated up, there was no way to get comfortable.  All the unit did was spew out uncooled air from outside.  We slept in our own sweat.  gross... That was the thing we should have brought up immediately.  Also as a hotel they should have central air and heating, but hey. We liked the hotel and the staff but the air and the wifi need some work.  We MIGHT come back but there is no guarantee.",3
315,"we were upgraded to a suite so I can't comment on how small the rooms were. ours was definitely comfortable. Pros: - LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. seriously walk to wrigley, southport, tons of food, bars, theaters and the El. - comfy bed. relatively quiet room - decent linens - friendly service Cons: - squeaky floors can be loud (but actually comical) - room decor is ""quaint"" and might be considered dated - tv is also quaint Would stay here again in a hearbeat. So much to walk around to and so much energy in the neighborhood.",4
316,Loved this place.  The location is great and the rooms are cute & quaint!  The bed was fantastic and the bathroom was so modern!  Some people might not dig the noise from the train and the traffic on Belmont.  So you light sleepers beware of this place!  They also have very friendly staff!,5
317,"Loved how close this hotel was to where we needed to be, but holy crap was that one of the worst night's sleep I've ever had. There is absolutely no soundproofing to prevent you from hearing the L, its announcements, and its chimes all night long. The AC was a window unit, so it was like having an open window and all the noise coming right in. I really wanted to like it here, and maybe it's not so bad in different rooms, but I'll never stay here again. They should consider adding earplugs to their basket of things to buy in the room, I'd gladly have paid big bucks for them during my sleepless night.",2
318,"The hotel is in a great location and offers a nice continental breakfast.  The major drawback the hotel has is the noise from the ""L"" train station at West Belmont.  I asked for a quiet room on the side away from the station some time in advance.  When I checked in, the clerk had me on the noisy side closer to the station.  He did move to what was ostensibly a quiet room, #208, but it turned out that the room was directly above a frozen yogurt shop.  The shop played blaring music that penetrated into my room.  When I called the front desk about it, they clearly knew the short comings of the room stating:  ""They'll close in about an hour.""  The hotel offered to move me, but I decided it wasn't worth the hassle.  I toughed it out and eventually the shop closed and the music stopped. I discussed the issue of getting a quiet room with the front desk clerk upon check out.  She informed me that though I might request a quiet room, there was no way they could guarantee one for me in advance. I emailed the hotel after having left with a summary of my concerns.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive a prompt email from the general manager apologizing for my inconveniences, offering a credit as compensation, and requesting that I call her.  I did call the GM, and she explained to me that the hotel had been working with the yogurt shop on noise issues.  Further she said she would talk with her staff as to how to better accomodate guests wanting quiet rooms.  Desired room types are not always available on the quiet side of the hotel.  In closing, she requested that I call her personally to arrange any future stays at City Suites. Given the gracious and generous response of City Suites' management, I will definitely give the hotel another shot.",3
319,"This inn is located in a very busy stretch on Belmont, so it may not be easy to get lots of sleep here. It is very close to the ""L"" station so you can get to downtown in minutes. You are surrounded by many restaurants and funky establishments.",3
320,"Incredible! Where do I start? At the great staff who checked us in, the decor of the lobby, the cute Parisian style elevator, the 2 tvs in our room, the excellent amenities in the bathroom, the modern mini bar, the comfortable pillows and bed, the soft towels, how it's the same $ as The Beverly Inn, LA but heaps better, the awesome complementary breakfast served in real bowls, not styrofoam!, their recycle bin in the lobby and there good location. Best quality hotel for this price range and this area for sure.",5
321,"Very cute hotel with close proximity to the red, purple and brown lines. We didn't gear the train that much unless our window was open and the only one that would open was in the bathroom so that wasn't an issue. The two bed rooms were large and had a pull out sleeper sofa. Though I didn't sleep on the sofa bed, the other beds were pretty comfy and relaxing after a long day of shopping on Michigan Ave. There are A TON of adorable local food options mixed in with your corporate options all within walking distance. Overall it's a cute place and a good find.",4
322,"If you like ""European Style"" hotels (but this one has a bigger and nicer lobby than you usually find in them), this place is for you.   I second David A.'s review right down to the last detail.  There were no issues with noise (or anything else, for that matter).   Tastefully appointed and decorated with contemporary style, but with that ""old building"" charm.   There's a 15 minute unmetered parking zone right in front, to help you get situated.   We left an article in the room on one of our two stays, and sure enough it was turned in and waiting for us at the front desk.  It was a light shell jacket and brand new, so someone in housekeeping would have been tempted to think ""look what I found"" ... but no;  so that's encouraging and consistent with our overall impression of the place. We were in town because a family member had been in an accident and was hospitalized at Illinois Masonic (4 blocks away).   We found out that City Suites has a special rate for that circumstance, so if you are in that situation, be sure to ask. We feel as if we found a ""second home"" in Chicago, and while no nice hotels in the city are inexpensive, this was well within the ""reasonable"" range.   Very relaxing ambience in a hustle-bustle neighborhood  helps to make this a winner, too. Both nights we got the ""last available"" room, so book ahead.  It's not a large property.   In reading others' comments, it appears our room locations must have been advantageous regarding the noise issues.   So ask about that when you book. Finally, the comment about ""quaint"" (including TVs) is puzzling.  They must have been doing some updating in some or all of the rooms.  We had a suite both times, both had sleek flat screens, and the furnishings and linens, etc... were in the category of ""chic"".",5
323,Great location by train wrigleyville bars field cheap beers ready in mini bar great stay $110 bucks on a Wednesday,4
324,Location is close to subway so hopefully you are a sound sleeper. Close to Boystown and alot of cool shopping areas. Be sure to stop and get a bite across the street at Clarks.,3
325,"A recent visit shows City Suites is still as good as ever.  Friendly staff, clean rooms.  The TV was a bit stubborn but we were able to get it going.  For the first time in many visits I stayed on the 'El' side of the hotel.  The windows seal tightly to block out most noise from the train- I was rarely aware of it.  The convenience to the train is a huge plus!  Belmont is as busy as ever, but here are tons of great restaurants within walking distance.",4
326,"Love this hotel, great staff, great location. The train is right by the hotel but it didn't wake me. There's lots of good food near by and it's just a short walk to Wrigley. What more could you want!",5
327,"My friend and I stayed here this past Valentine's weekend.  It's an older hotel so it has a really nice atmosphere and old-fashioned (i.e. courteous) service.  They were not intrusive but very accommodating.  GREAT location for us - just a few blocks from Wrigley Field, and near several cool nightclubs, The Metro a few blocks past Wrigley Field, and tons of shops, restaurants, bars.  The CTA is close by as are other public transportation.  VERY comfy beds, robes were provided, as well as a very efficient blowdryer.  Only complaint was that like most buildings in colder climes, the heat was very high and we could not figure out how to turn down the radiator.  Fortunately, the windows opened so we got some fresh air.  Given the small amount of time we actually spent in the room, we didn't bother calling down to ask about the heat, but I'm sure they would have responded right away, just like they did to all our requests. We checked out 2/15 and stayed with a friend for 2 more days, then went home.  That's when I realized I'd forgotten a favorite sweatshirt!  Called the day I got home, 2/17,  and spoke with Maria.  She called me back to let me know she'd found my sweatshirt and I delightedly gave her my cc info to have them mail me my shirt.  It arrived yesterday along with a top Ithat I forgot I'd forgotten! Will definitely stay here again! Affordable too!!",4
328,"I knew when I booked this place I was not getting someplace fancy, so my review is based on that knowledge going in. I paid rather more then I would for a room like this anyplace else, but it was still the cheapest place in downtown Chicago for the night I was in town. The lobby is very pretty and well taken care of. The upstairs floors are dark and rather worn, but still fairly well cared for. The room was small but it was just me and my suitcase so I didn't care. You could hear the trains from the room, but they weren't disruptively loud. The biggest complaint I have about the room is that despite it being a non-smoking room starting about 10pm the room started to smell very strongly of stale smoke. Running the fan/AC didn't help and the windows were painted shut so there was no way to get fresh air in the room. It only got stronger as the night went along to the point where I started to get a migraine from it - needless to say did not actually get much sleep. It was a fantastic location for me to go out and wander from though, and they have a secured and guarded parking garage across the street for those that drive in. Alo free and surprisingly good internet service! Staff for the most part was friendly, except I was looked at like I was from another planet when I asked about the possibility of early check-in. Overall though a decent budget place if you just want a place to crash for the night.",3
329,"Budget budget budget. The horrible isn't the worst I've stayed in but for the price it was pretty weak. I was here this past wknd and much to my surprise, this joint was $135 a night. Now for the location alone, being one block from Millennium Park and walking distance to Magnificent Mile, I could put up with the price. But this place just seemed dirty and out of date. The staff that I dealt with was nice, friendly and helped with directions but service alone doesn't make up for the lack of aesthetics of this place. The elevators took forever and make questionable noises, the hallway to the room reminded me of something from The Shining and the room was not nice. Thank god we were only staying there for one night because I don't think I could've done longer. The bed needed to be replaced, along with the pillows and itchy comforters (blue light what??), the curtains on the window weren't even long enough to cover the window so we couldn't get total darkness when we wanted to take a nap. The shower was decent but the window to the curtain in the bathroom ended up falling down and it looked as if someone put it up there with bubble gum to fix it previously. Plus, you could open the window with no screen from the 11th floor. Thank god I was in a right state of mind the time I was there! The L runs right across the street so that may bother some but it really didn't bother me too much. Good location and nice staff but they really need to do something about the hotel itself if they want to get more than two stars which seems to be the majority vote here on Yelp. PS-Free wifi!",2
330,"I have mixed feelings about this place. It is the cheapest place on that area of downtown, but it is in very sad shape. The lobby is not nice but is a LOT nicer than the room. This is the only Travelodge location I have ever seen that does not include a free breakfast. The elevators are really, really slow... up to a ten minute wait at busy times. But the front desk staff was excellent. The carpet in the room needs replacing badly. There were iron burns on it and it was filthy. The room was very noisy as we were on the same level as the elevated train, which corners by every 6 minutes. The room was large but most of the space was wasted due to a terrible layout that put one of the beds blocking the entry to the bathroom. The bathroom was nice but there was literally no surface space other than the floor to put anything. They put the tissues on the desk because there is nowhere to fit it in the bathroom. Strangely, the bathroom is quite large and would have plenty of space for shelves. If you are looking for a bargain, this is your place, but if you have the money, I would recommend staying somewhere else.",2
331,"Very old hotel. Decor is aged and is in need of repair/replacement. Our AC was missing the whole front of the unit & it was filthy, the carpet was worn bare, and the walls had about 20 coats of paint on it. Very dirty rooms (could write my name in the dust). The hallways stink horribly, so does the lobby. The employees were friendly for the most part, and there is a good/simple diner attached to the hotel. I would not stay at this hotel again, I would find another option.",2
332,"Guys, this is totally a four star hotel for being a Travelodge. I'm a total fan. I stayed here three nights while scouting out Chicago for the first time for a potential future conference. The rates are reasonable (you don't need to pay for parking at $35/night; just take the ridiculously easy and affordable public transit everywhere), the staff is friendly (enough) and the neighborhood is super convenient to anywhere and everywhere you want to go. I didn't see, or miss, a continental breakfast, a gym, a sauna, a doorman or fancy flat screen tv's. Three of us shared a double room and did get: 2 beds, 1 refrigerator, 1 microwave, 2 closets, 1 tv, 1 clean bathroom, a great view of the city and plenty of space. Like I mentioned, it's close to public transit--the red line is wicked close, and the blue, purple, brown, pink and green lines are all within 4 blocks. If you want to bus anywhere, there's tons of buses that come ALL THE TIME, and if you want to walk, well, bundle up if it's January. Doable, though. More often than not, a hotel room is just a place where you crash when visiting a city. For that purpose, the Travelodge gets a super firm thumbs up from me.",4
333,Look. A Travelodge is a Travelodge is a Travelodge is a Travelodge. If you booked a reservation at a Travelodge and when you got there were disappointed because you realized you were at a Travelodge then in the future you should not book a reservation at a Travelodge. Did my bath tub get clogged? Maybe. Did girls run up and down the hall drunk at 5am? Maybe. Did it meet my expectations? Absolutely. Worth the money for the location. Enough said. Boom.,3
334,"You can't beat the price! I was traveling alone for a conference and didn't want to over-spend my funding. Travelodge was referred to as the ""ghetto"" hotel by all the other conference attendees, but I was the only one who GOT FREE INTERNET. Plus, my room was AT LEAST 1/2 the price of what they paid. While not luxurious, it definitely was not a sink hole. I stayed for a week and got to know the staff fairly well. They were friendly and always promptly responded if I needed assistance (like extra coffee or an ironing board). I felt COMPLETELY safe in the hotel and in the surrounding proximity. The hotel is half a block from Lake Michigan and Buckingham Fountain. It's close to the red line, major cta bus routes, and Lou Malnati's pizza. If you call the headquarters to book a room and then find a lower rate, you just fill out a form online and they match the rate PLUS give you a 10% discount. GREAT for people wanting to be IN the heart of Chicago without paying 150-200 dollars per night. With taxes and charges, I spent 7 nights for $600 (on Memorial Day weekend, no less).",3
335,"I loved this place!! Amazing location right in the middle of the city. Very inexpensive. Super friendly staff and free wifi. Rooms were small but clean, AC worked well, and bathroom was clean and we had plenty of towels and toiletries. I would definitely recommend it and would stay again.",5
336,"It's a great location, safe, but you get what you pay for. The rooms are medium sized, stale, old fashioned. The beds and pillows are cheap and old. There are pipes inside the bedrooms and the TVs are CRTs that I didn't know still existed. The windows are 100 years old and have 100 years of paint on them -- not child safe as you can raise them on the 14th floor and climb right out. My bathroom was updated, but my tub had a liner over the old tub which you could feel had a hole in the bottom. AC is a window unit that the maid turns off during the day, so it's stifling when you get back late at night. The maids didn't get to my room until after dinner each night, but they did a good job when they got around to it. No mini fridges. Slowest elevators. Free internet! Nice staff! I paid $170 a night for two twins (we wanted a queen) in late July. There are probably better places for a little bit more, but we took advantage of the walk to the park every single day. It was quiet, probably due to two factors: sturdy construction and unoccupied rooms.",2
337,"Sigh. What a pity. I was searching for a hotel in the downtown area for my trip to Chicago and Expedia threw up this Travelodge which was almost in the heart of downtown and good subway connections. With such a great location, they should be trying to make the best of it but instead, this hotel seems to have given up competely with any other effort to create a good hotel experience. This started off at check in when they observed the 3pm check in time to the minute. Any classy hotel chain would allow some leeway if the rooms are ready. So there was a huge queue of disgruntled customers all piled up at the desk at 3pm. There seemed to be little effort by the staff to appear helpful or particularly friendly. The room was adequate in a hostel standard type of way. In a way, it was good beause it forced me to get out and explore Chicago more althought I was feeling tired and jetlagged. Thank goodness I was only in Chicago for a night. Like any good Chinese person, I love a good bargain but this place isn't even worth the reduced price I did pay.",2
338,"Only in your most desperate moments should you book a room here. I mean moments where, in order to survive the night, you should get rid of the gun and the hooker and get your ass to a meeting. Other acceptable circumstances include being a college student who's coming to scope out apartments in Chicago, and who wants to stay in a place that has locks on the doors and a private bath. In that case, one extra star for complimentary breakfast that's at least as good as the food on campus. Bonus: Prominently displayed certificate stating that it is a Most Improved Property. Yeesh.",2
339,"My first impression of this place was that it was very basic, which was fine for about $70 a night in downtown Chicago. And that would have been fine, except that I woke up the next morning with a COCKROACH on my FACE. Possibly the biggest cockroach I have ever seen, and the laziest. I think it may have just wanted a good night's sleep. It waited for the front desk attendant I called, crawling from my pillow to the middle of the bed. The attendant cheerfully informed my boyfriend and I that it ""must have come from the restaurant below."" Needless to say, our vouchers for free breakfast were returned with the key.   I'm pretty sure the elevators are broken. Or just really slow. I waited more than ten minutes for a ride down and ended up having to lug my stuff down the stairs. We got a small discount on the hotel rate, $18 off for ""customer dissatisfaction"" because of the cockroach incident. Sorry guys, $18 off doesn't cover it. There's a decent looking hostel down the street. There's a bunch of nicer hotels within a block or two of this place. My recommendation is: anywhere but here.",1
340,"Nothing special here... about $110 a night for a queen bed, with $10/night for Wifi, provided by an outside vendor.  Next time I'm there, I think I'll try to stay a bit north of the Loop, but as it was, there was a decent amount of stuff around here, and the Red Line stops a block away.  This is also within walking distance to Museum Campus, Buckingham Fountain, & Millennium Park, so it's got that going for it. The rooms themselves were perfectly clean and everything.  Like I said, nothing particularly special, but perfectly acceptable for my three night stay.",4
341,"Call me cheap but i thought this place was PERFECT!!!  Went on vacation with two girl friends of mine and stayed here in June (the most expensive month to vacation) and got the room at $95 per night. Why in the world would you go on vacation to this AMAZING city of Chicago and then want to stay in your hotel room?!   That just boggles my freaking mind!!!   I am no Bougie-Suzie, so this hotel fit me like a glove..   When I'm on vacation the amount of time I spend in my hotel room is close to none.   I want to be out and about, and only return to my hotel room in such a drunken stupor that I can give two rats asses about if the sheets are 200billion thread count.  WHO CARES?!   I'm gonna knock the eff out anyways.  Wake up and then do it all over again.  A hotel, while on vacation, is only a place for me to sleep in.   As long as the place is safe enough for me to not sleep with my shank tucked underneath my pillow - then I'm all in. For the rate we got this room, i think it was absolute perfection compared to the rates you'll get at other hotels that are right smack in the middle of downtown Chicago.  The location is amazing.  Walking distance to EVERYTHING.  With Grant Park, Millennium Park, Warehouse Liquors, Buddy Guy's Legends, immediate public transportation access, Lou Malnati's and a 24hr Dunkin' Donuts to feed your post-club drunken debauchery right next door;  just to name a couple of things you are adjacent to this hotel.  A mere 5 minute cab ride away from  anything you want to go to in the city.   This hotel is a STEAL!   The staff were good sports.  Especially when my group strolled in around 5:30am just looking a drunken hot mess with left over Rock N Roll McDonald's bags at hand.   I'm sure everyone at front desk got a good laugh watching us make a dent in that city.   ^-^  The staff laughed at all our sarcastic jokes and there was always someone around kind enough to take us on the frate elevators when the regular ones were busy.  LOVE THEM! Deal-tastic for those who like a great steal!  (ME!!) But Bougie-Suzies BEWARE - this place just isn't your cup of afternoon tea.",4
342,"You get what you paid for. One roll of toilet paper and if you need more call and request it, phone not working, room service cleans your room around 4-7 pm so you have to wait for them to clean your room and get clean towels, elevators extremely slow, the beds mattresses are really flat and uncomfortable as well as the pillows ( you only get two pillows per bed), free Internet, close to downtown and conveniently closed to train, fair prices for being close to downtown, okay lobby, staff were also just okay, could have better customer service, AC worked, and you can not open the windows, no bathroom vents so it gets stuffy.",2
343,"This was the worst hotel i have ever stayed it. PERIOD. Coming from Minneapolis to Chicago, my flight was delayed, so I called ahead to make sure they wouldn't give away my room. They said no problem. So I arrive at the hotel around 11:30pm and check it. I reserved a 2 bed room. I get a room with one bed. I call down to the front desk. They have no more 2 bed rooms. Can we have a cot/rollaway? They don't do roll aways. Can you just sleep on the couch. NO, I CANNOT JUST SLEEP ON THE COUCH. I'm paying you $150. Finnally, they decide they can get me a second 1 bed room for my companion... ok fine. Second room is the size of a closet and smells like cigarettes (despite the fact the entire hotel is ""non smoking"" ).  Not only that, but the window is painted shut, so I cannot get any real fresh air. I turn on the air conditioner full blast and it lasts about 3 minutes and then just turns off. I try to turn on a lamp at this point but nothing happens. The alarm clock is also dead. THE AC TRIPPED THE CIRCUIT BREAKER. WTF. Not only that, but the vent in the bathroom looked like someone punched a whole in the wall and then tried to put a grate over it. The next day around 9am I try to go complain to the manager. ""He isn't in today."" Huh? Not in today? What do you mean. He's the fricken manager. Needless to say I checked out early. Horrible experience. Maybe the worst ever.",1
344,"I've stayed in this hotel on two separate occasions, and I dont really know why I decided to repeat my experience there. The first time was out of desperation when my friends and I were visiting from Texas and got kicked out of my friends' place where we were staying.  This place was the cheapest we could find in downtown so we went for it.  The second time I was just too lazy too really research.  My own fault. The rooms are very basic, quite small, little to no amenities, etc.  But you're paying what you do for the location - end of story.  It's steps from Grant Park and the Red Line. But I recommend you spend a little extra money for a hotel with a decent standard of service and hospitality.",2
345,"I was shocked at the reviews of this place after staying here. In fact they almost deterred me from booking, but since I was on a holiday budget and http://Priceline.com gave me a room for $50/night I said lets roll the dice. Now that being said, I wouldn't do this hotel again for $100 or more like many of the other reviewers seemed to have paid. I could see why they felt ripped. The nearby Hilton and other gorgeous hotels on Michigan probably go for more and I see how these guys undercut the budget market. But try not and pay full price for this place or you might feel taken.... While old and charming, the hotel is run down. Really old. Old bed, old TV, smaller room, you get it...but they do have HBO.... however ESPN was down and that was all I wanted to watch a bowl game. But we were all about seeing the city and received nothing but a great experience. We were able to walk to Millennium Park, the Art Institute, The Sears (aka Willis Tower), Navy Pier, a bunch of good eateries -- and best of all a block from the train. I'd be back... but only for a http://Priceline.com -- $50 deal --  nice stay, friendly staff and the little breakfast cafe downstairs was actually decent and cheap. The only bummer was the parking is $28 extra a day.",4
346,"The only thing which justifies the forced one star us that this place is right off Michigan Ave. There were large roaches in my neighbors room, which made me worry. The piece of what looked like rat's skin in my own rattled me but I was still thinking this is just a hole to crash in at night. I did not freak out till I found that my room's door was not locking at all. I had already left my valuables and gone out running once before I realized it. And I when I realized it, I was on my way for an appointment. When it became clear that I had to choose between leaving my door wide ajar as the handyman fixed it and being 1.5 hours late for my appointment I had just had enough. Plus by now I was convinced that the one thing one looks for in a hole-to-crash is safety, and there was no way I was going to feel safe at this place. I launched orbitz from my phone and booked the closest decent looking hotel, in this case The Essex Inn which was just a block further south. It turned out to be a much better place, at a better price than what I had booked my room at this Travelodge for. However, this was not the end of it. I got gangsta treatment from the guy (wearing the name tag ""Ken"") at the reception who banged pens and key cards at the desk, was staring at me and generally giving the attitude that he wanted to jump across the counter and grab my neck, and came close to mouthing obscenities and tried big time intimidation by staring. Good riddance to bad rubbish, and I am never going back to this shit hole.",1
347,"We got a room with a king size bed for $83 a night, great for college students and anyone else travelling on a budget. The bathroom was clean and updated, and the shower stays warm even though the water pressure is lower than I'm used to. The TV has a variety of channels, including HBO and MTV. What we loved was that the Harrison station (red line) is only a block away and close to many bus stops. There is even a Dunkin Donuts and Subway across the street, and a CVS and 7-Eleven nearby. Even though the track for several trains going into the loop is right out in front of the building, we were able to sleep through the night just fine. The only things that woke us up were people next door to us and outside our room due to the thin walls. Granted, we were right in front of the elevators. Other than that, we were very satisfied with how much we paid for the room.",3
348,"Good: Cheap rates, clean bed, clean bathroom, two good inexpensive restaurants on-site, and good location. Bad: Tiny rooms. Though the essentials were clean, certain things were a little dirty... such as exposed sprinkler system and other nooks and crannies. I don't expect these areas to be cleaned daily, but they should be cleaned at least a few times each year. The carpet was a little raveled in places. The hotel website incorrectly list a ""complimentary"" internet station. You actually need to swipe a credit card to use... no big deal, but poorly stated on website. Also, the printer at this station did not work for my entire 3-day visit. Again... no big deal, but I felt the staff should have placed an ""out of order"" sign on the device. (I would've been upset if I paid to print... only to find out I could not.) I compare this hotel to a Motel 6. Though I love nice hotels, my goal was to see the city and sleep cheap. It served the purpose. Again, the location was great... within walking distance to several attractions and only one block from the CTA (Harrison-red line-subway). Would I stay here again? Yes. However, another $20/night may get a nicer place.",3
349,"I have a mixed review for this place...it was cheap so I understand you don't get as much, but my first night of sleep was painful....bright light leaked in from the curtains from outside and since I'm a light sleeper the light kept waking me up.  The next night I got creative and I put a bed sheet over the window frame which blocked the light.  I also ran the air-conditioning at night to block the noise from the Ltrain. Pros - cheap, air conditioning works, good location, clean room Cons - Small small room, no parking for cars, elevators took a while",3
350,"Though I haven't had an opportunity to stay at this hotel, I must comment on the customer service I received when calling for some information! I had several question regarding my travel plans...parking and nearby lots, the best restaurants in the area and fun nightlife I was interested in. I spoke with Edwardo on the phone (front desk person) and he was very helpful and courteous in answering all of my questions. I felt like i was on the phone with GOOGLE! Very informative and patient, he really helped me with my trip details! I can't wait to book my stay, I know that if all else fails the customer service will be there to accommodate me.",5
351,"Hubby and I arrived by Greyhound and had 8 hours before we had to be at the airport. We decided that a shower and a nap would be the ideal way to spend those 8 hours. The Holiday Inn Express was closed so we were directed to the Travelodge. It was going to cost us $120 to stay there for a total of 6 hours. When we were told the amount, we actually left and checked out the two nearest youth hostels to see if they had any availability. Sadly, they were all booked up and we were running on zero hours of sleep and the vicious flashbacks of whining babies on the Greyhound. We actually returned to this place and paid. The next two weeks we spent backpacking in Europe (Germany & Czech Republic) and every single night we stayed in hostels that were LARGER, CLEANER, NEWER, and CHEAPER. This is taking into the account our incredibly weak dollar in the face of the euro. I still cant believe we caved in.  :(",1
352,"I understood when booking the hotel that it was a two star hotel. I did not expect the Hilton. However, my stay was completely awful. I chose the travelodge because I had stayed there before because of it's location. It is super close the the red line and downtown. However, I would rather walk until my feet fall completely off then ever stay there again. The hotel rooms were disgusting and out-dated -- not to mention the staff was so damn rude. I felt like I was in trouble when I talked to them. I will save up and travel further...I hate the travelodge.",1
353,"I stayed here because this was the hotel the coordinators of the conference I was going to chose for us.  The conference happened at Roosevelt U. just a few blocks away. They will be getting an angry letter from me. I wish I could give this place half a star.  And that's only because it was in a good spot close to the train (we could hear it from our room) and walking distance to some cool stuff.  It's right next to the lake and there's a 24 hour BR across the street which is nice since the hotel has no vending machines with food in them. Reasons why I suggest never staying at this hotel: - Our room was TINY...I think it was meant to be for a queen/king but they shoved two full sized beds in it - There was a 1.5 inch margin between the floor and the bottom of our door...wtf? - The elevators hardly worked and we got to ride the ""fun"" manual elevator whenever the employees got around to it - Nothing was as clean as it should have been - No one knew anything...we were quoted one price and charged another...we had to negotiate for a compromise All around a bad experience!",1
354,"If you see pictures of this place, it doesn't really look that bad, it actually appears to be pretty decent looking... wrong!!!! Really, the only word to describe this ""hotel"" is DINGY.  It is horribly outdated and although the bathroom looked like an attempt to renovate had been made, the toilet was the kind with the thin metal lever like you would find in a gas station.  The door looked like it had clearly been kicked in at one point and they restuck the chain link on there to make you feel safe... um yeah. which brings me to my major point of contention with this place because sometimes all you really need is a bed to crash in at the end of the day and in that case who cares if it's not the ritz, but I have never felt more unsafe in my entire life!  It truly felt like any minute could have been my last staying in that place.  The windows were small and extremely dirty, the a/c unit turned on and off all night.  Honestly, I would not recommend it and I would never stay here again.   The ""upside"":  Pretty good location - right off S. Michigan Ave, across from Grant Park (which is beautiful).  We were able to walk to everything we wanted to do, including the Sears, restaurants, shops, a trolley tour, etc. The location alone is why it get's that one star.  Also, the parking garage guy is really nice but the whole garage is a little bit of a sketchy scene too... when you go to pick it up in the back, there is this whole pulley system that looks like they drop your car 20 feet underground.  It's a little awkward (also fairly expensive - cost us $65 for 2 nights - which maybe isn't that bad, but we already felt like we were being porked on the crappy hotel).",1
355,"It's a Travelodge, so I didn't really expect anything better than what I got. The price was reasonable, and the location is hard to beat. It's a quick walk to the Metra and El stations, and it is across the street from Grant Park. There is also free wireless internet, and two restaurants attached. The biggest issue I had was with the hotel staff. They were very rude when me and my friends needed separate receipts, and would sit on the phone talking to friends instead of helping people who were waiting. The room itself was ok- not too bad, but nothing special. The temperature was very hard to keep comfortable, and there was a big gap between the floor and the bottom of the door.",2
356,"This hotel has a very European budget feel. However, we are in America. I can handle an old building. What I cannot handle is elevators that do not run properly, are extremely stuffy and slow, and GET STUCK, requiring you to press the call button to be rescued from the elevator by the maintenance crew. This hotel has 2 modern elevators and 1 manual elevator. Why they still have a manual elevator is beyond me, but thank god for that thing because during my stay only 1 of the modern elevators was ever running, and when we got stuck in it the manual elevator aided in our rescue mission. Only staff can run the manual lift, so that meant that all guests across 12 floors were using 1 elevator. This created a big hassle and long waits to get to and from your room (we were on the 12th floor - stairs not really an option). I also just did not feel safe in the elevators. The location is great, staff are nice and competent (expect for the housekeeper - she was rudeness to the max), wi-fi is free, and luckily our room was quiet. But the furnishings are very cheap and outdated. The double beds are just doubles, not queen size. And housekeeping would only give us 1 roll of toilet paper at a time. We had 4 people in the room! Needless to say we ran out of toilet paper each day of our stay. Also, we had a suite with a ""kitchenette,"" but there was really nothing that you could do in this kitchenette other than store leftovers in the fridge, heat them up in the microwave, and then eat them with your bare hands. There was no silverware, plates, glasses, nothing - just some paper cups. So if you want to take advantage of the ""kitchenette"" you'll have to bring the same type of gear you'd bring on a picnic. I expect more from a national chain!",2
357,"Completely adequate and a great location. Painful for a cheapskate like me not To book the 50$ spot out in the the burbs, but location, location, location.",4
358,This hotel should not be stayed in by humans!   Front desk staff bad the only thing good ids the bell staff they are great should be at a 5 star hotel.  the rooms are bad!!!! the hostel rooms down the street woulsd be a beeter choice.  Stay on the street if you can,1
359,"I think this place rocks. We got a huge room with a kitchenette and free wifi at the last minute for a little over $100. It's not excessively stylish, but it gets the job done in terms of practical wants and needs. A little noisy, but it's downtown Chicago. I'm a fan, and the location is cool.",4
360,"Another awful hotel located just next door to the also-awful Congress Plaza. As sh!tty as the Congress usually is, I'd have to rate this Travelodge even lower. I wish I could give it zero stars. Or even negative-two-stars. It sucked THAT BAD. The lobby smelled like diarrhea. The elevators were broken the entire time I was there, which was extra fun since the entire hotel was full of Lollapalosers and it was hot as f-ck outside (and in, since their AC barely seems to work). There was some kind of sewer gas leaking into every crevice in the building that created the aforementioned stink. The bathrooms were disgusting. And again with the protein-stains on the bedding. Um, okay hotels...people F-CK in your rooms, okay? They're going to leak their nasty juices all over your sheets so STOP BUYING WHITE SHEETS FOR YOUR BEDS! If there's going to be dried spooge on my bed, I'd at least prefer not to see it. Writing this review is a waste of my time and yours. You only need two words from me: STAY AWAY.",1
361,"Ideal location but one MAJOR problem - it's a Travelodge!  My husband and I, along with my mother drove from Detroit for a weekend getaway and stayed in the hotel one night.  The lobby smelled like someone's bathroom, the night shift desk clerk barely spoke any English, and the hallways were badly in need of new carpet and paint.  The room was small, for having two double beds.  Our bed was made and had freshly laundered sheets, but the bathroom was DISGUSTING - it looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in several days!  We were too tired to complain so we didn't say anything.  When we returned home, we called Travelodge's 800 number and reported our problems.  We also filed a dispute with our credit card company.  If the hotel was a better brand name and had better management, it would be perfect!  One more thing...we hated being ripped off for parking, but the hotel garage is the only place to park :(  Only if you MUST stay downtown on a limited budget would I recommend staying here.",1
362,"I stayed here during my last two visits to Chicago because it's consistently the best value for the location.  The rooms were clean and spacious but clearly aging.  The front desk staff is friendly and speedy and the hotel is an easy walk to the Loop, Grant Park, and the subway.  If the price is right, I would stay here again for my next visit.",3
363,"Never Again! This hotel needs a serious makeover. It is dingy and gross looking. The rooms have old beds, gross looking carpet, and just look old. The only good part about this hotel, was the guy at the front who gave us tips on where to eat. I would only stay here again if this was the absolute last place in the city to sleep!",1
364,"We were seeing a concert at the Auditorium Theater which right across the street.  We paid roughly about 90 bucks for this room for one night, and we were very dissapointed.  The pictures are very misleading. I read some of the previous reviews about being 'harsh' and 'you get what you paid for' etc...That's understandable with cosmetic issues and outdated upholstry and stuff.  But this was no excuse why our TV had one blurry channel, our toilet was leaking the whole time so there was constantly a trail of water, both lights above both beds did not work (yes they were plugged in), our couch was covered in stains and hair, and our view was of a hideous run down building that looked like a murder scene out of 'Saw'.  Oh and the beds--oh my God, those BEDS! SOOO uncomfortable!!  I woke up feeling like I got beat up from the rock hard mattress, the pillows were about as comfortable as sleeping on a balled up paper towel (and are unusually small for hotel pillows, they looked like decorative throw pillows), and you may as well slept on the floor, it would have felt the same, but you would have had more room to stretch out.  The beds are clearly not made for couples. It's an old building, we get it, but some of these things were unexcuseable.  The whole hotel needs a serious facelift, and TV's that aren't from 1987 and still need to have the antennas adjusted to get a semi-clear channel.",2
365,"I don't know why there are so many haters for this place. I got $50/night deal off Expedia, and had a great experience for that price. Sure the place is a little run-down, but give me a historic hotel with some cosmetic faults and the occasional broken light over a modern eyesore for $200 anyday. Recommend!",4
366,"I've put off writing this review, only because I didn't want to admit that I actually stayed here, but I have, and I agree with what most everyone before me has said. Dumpy rooms, extremely slow elevators (although on my first trip down the elevator DID try to speed my trip up by coming to a complete stop and then dropping a floor or so), and uncomfortable bed/furniture. I'm not even sure it's worth staying here for the location, at least not if you're planning on evening activities. The lack of activity on this part of Michigan Avenue after dark makes it feel very unsafe and uncomfortable. The next time I'm in Chicago I'll cough up a bit more dough and stay in a slightly more upscale joint.",1
367,"We stayed here last August on our way back from the Chicago airport.  It's conveniently located (lots of eating establishments, and Lake Michigan nearby), and billed as ""most improved"" property in the downtown area. Accomodations are not bad if you don't mind the occasional torn bedsheet or mystery stain on the carpet.  The bellhop was very friendly and helpful when our key wouldn't work.  For the price you pay, it's a good bargain.",3
368,"I'm suprised by the harsh reviews. It's certainly not a fancy hotel, but it's relatively cheap and centrally located. If you're visiting Chicago for the first time and on a tight budget, I think it's a great place to stay. It's close to mass transit, walking distance from a variety of musems and bars, and pretty safe. For blues lovers, Buddy Guy's bar is a block away.",3
369,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. Considering that my last stay here was during the summer and with the spate of conventions in town my only options were a) this place or b) an $800/night room at the Peninsula, frugality won out. The room made me think of that old line from ""Wings"", where Lowell said ""I wonder how many people committed suicide in this dump."" I get that it is an inexpensive hotel, but you would think that with the amount of business it gets and the location the management could have done something to make the place more appealing (hairdryers in the rooms, people, hello?). I might also add that the noise from the elevated train was unbearable and, between that and the flimsy door with equally flimsy deadbolt, I got around 2 hours of sleep the one and only night I stayed there. Save yourselves the money and sleep in the lobby of one of the many swish hotels just up the street.",1
370,stay somewhere else. idk how these pics got here but the place looks nothing like the pic.  0 stars is more like it. our room was right next to the rail system. it ran all night. i would not even take off my shoes my whole stay.,1
371,"The Congress is very near and dear to my heart. This was the hotel I stayed at when I came to Chicago and stayed by myself for the first time. It had since then become my go to hotel if I ever need a room on short notice. The hotel is very old but not in a musty, gross, dilapidated, scary way. You can tell that it must have been such a grand and luxurious place back when it originally opened. The lobby is so beautiful with its mosaic work. No it has not been update or renovated very recently but it has been very well maintained. In fact I actually like the way the rooms are just as they are now. I find the Congress very charming, warm and comfortable. It's very clean and all of the staff have always been accommodating and courteous. That being said I do think they must have some sort of deal worked out with Exchequer because both times I asked the concierge/door guy/bellhop he suggested I go there and gave me a voucher for 15 percent off my meal. And this place has terrible service! So I can't imagine they would suggest you dine there unless there was something in it for them But that's another story. Congress also has a pretty decent location on top of everything. Maybe I'm just biased by the sentimental attachment I have to it but I think it's a wonderful hotel and would definitely recommend it. :)",4
372,"You know what? It's been almost a year since I stayed in this hotel, and as time has gone by, I realize I miss it. I was sent to Chicago for a week for work and this hotel was recommended for being relatively centrally located and cheap...and it is indeed both of these things. The style of the hotel could be called ""tired"" by some, but I would call it American Traditional. Wood is dark, ceilings vaulted, etc. I've stayed in the ""Ice Room"" in the W in Hollywood, but I actually enjoyed coming back to the Congress every evening more than I enjoyed the modern ultra-hip vibe. There was something cozy about it, and that's important to me because I travel for work fairly frequently, and often on my own too. The only con was the service. Workers aren't very friendly or helpful, and the room service food is overpriced and downright bad. I went to Panera for breakfast every morning as it is located around the corner. Also, the fact that you had to pay for internet was annoying. You pay by the 24 hours and they are consecutive, meaning if you use it for 10 minutes and then use it for 10 minutes 25 hours later, you pay twice.",4
373,Not a bad place.  Not fancy.  Rooms are old and worn.  But everything worked.  We were comfortable and things were pretty clean.  Great great location.  Was a perfect place for our family to gather.,3
374,"I stayed here several years ago and was not impressed by anything but the location, which is on Michigan avenue and its cheap(er) price.  It was New Year's Day and we were happy and surprised to have found the room.  Though it is far from the main tourist drag up north, it is next to two art museums: the Art Institute and the Museum of Contemporary Photography. It's also close to State Street, and a few blocks from the lake.  Thus the two stars. More recently I went here for a wedding.  Must have been a great cheap deal. I must have stayed here a long time ago, because this place has really gone down from even the basic quality I remembered. The first thing you get to see is a bunch of strikers picketing.  A few people at the reception were grumbling about having to cross that line, and I heard later that was because they were union themselves.  I was told that to cross a picket line is an insult against the strikers and makes a particular political statement. Despite the strike, which apparently has been going for a while (their strike signs looked worn)  the place is operating, but not fully.  There was an escalator going up to the hall that did not work.  There were toilets that did not work and were covered with plastic.  You could tell these items had been not functioning a while.  The place could have been cleaner, maybe it just needed some paint.  The food at the reception was ok, but even in the dimmed lights you could see that even the mashed potatoes had been made carelessly: they were dark and oxidized.   Just a small careless error, a detail, but it was another piece in the puzzle. They could have tried harder. Congress neglects  their building the details and apparently their employees too. Overall, I'd describe the place as worn and depressing.   Someone should buy this place and fix it up; take advantage of its location.  Has potential.  As they say in real estate ""fixer upper"".  Needs some TLC.",2
375,Very tired hotel...but great location.,2
376,The only thing this hotel has going for it is its location on Michigan Avenue.,2
377,"Recently stayed at The Congress for two nights just as a get away into Chicago. The hotel was beautiful, quiet and set in time past that was fun to see and be a part of for a short time. Convenient walking distance to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, Grant Park and all the downtown shops and restaurants. Had a Lakeview King Suite - gorgeous and the view from the 8th floor overlooking Michigan Avenue and out onto Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain was amazing. Paid a little over $320 for the two nights and it was worth it.",4
378,Great location and service!! Freshly baked cookies at check in.,5
379,"Great hotel at the center of Chicago. Easy access to many of the key sites in Chicago. So ideal location. The hotel is relatively inexpensive considering the location. The beds have varying sleep number dials so whatever is your preference in madras, you got it. The rooms are fairly roomy and many of them have good views. The internet is free :-) The breakfast is not included. You can get it at the next door Weber Grill. The breakfast is mediocre and maybe not the highlight of this venue. The hotel is modern and overall very efficient. My only complaint. We tried the valet parking ($49 / night - ouch) and the service is slow and not dependable. I would recommend parking in the parking structure next door. Cheaper and more reliable. Otherwise a really nice hotel.",4
380,"One of the best locations in Chicago, walking distance to many things, and right outside the red line. After being spoiled by 5 star places in the last year, I was not expecting much from a Hilton Garden Inn, but I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was nicely done, and the front desk was speedy, friendly, and efficient. The rooms were nice sized, with very comfy beds, and clean modern updated bathrooms. They even had a mini fridge and microwave. Our air-conditioning vent was directed right at my face the first night and kept waking me up, but after arranging the curtains and blocking it with a pillow the second night, it was much better. Parking was valet only and was around $40 a night, which is in line with everything else in the area. For the room price, you can't get better, and I would definitely choose to stay here again.",4
381,"I came here with a group of people for a birthday weekend away. We found a deal where we got rooms here for about 150/night which is pretty good for a downtown hotel on a weekend. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The bed was pretty comfy, although I did have to adjust the mattress a bit. I didn't have a great view but my friends had an amazing view from their room. And the staff were super-friendly and very helpful. The location is really what sweetens this hotel. You can walk pretty much anywhere downtown from here (and I did) but the red line is right outside the front door of the hotel so you can get just about anywhere in town. I will definitely stay here again. ETA: I completely forgot! We had a gigantic bathroom in our room which totally makes up for the ""kinda"" city view.",4
382,"Stayed here on a recent trip to Chicago and the location is excellent.  The hotel is right in front of the Red Line, a short hop from the Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, and Millennium Park.  I actually never used public transit once during my trip and walked everywhere instead. I checked out the gym and it's quite small, but there are a fair number of treadmills there.  The swimming pool was also small, so don't expect to swim laps.  Overall, the facilities aren't bad and much better than nothing. The room I stayed in had 2 queen sized beds and was quite roomy.  Some small complaints that I have are that there is no safe in the room, and there is no bathroom fan. The service was wonderful!  Upon arriving, we used the parking valet and as the bellhop helped us into the lobby, I realized that I had left my wallet in the car.  The bellhop ran outside and chased down the valet, and I had my wallet back within a minute.  I don't normally use valet parking, so this was a very good experience for my first time. If I'm in the Chicago area again in the future, I'll definitely stay here.",4
383,"No rooms at the inn, The Conrad that is. We have a Thursday night benefit (less glamorous than it sounds, it was at the FOP) and the dental show is in town...ugh. So I begin searching for the best deal in town.   Low and behold, here is the Hilton Garden Inn, inches from the Conrad. Great location, awesome service, clean rooms and a comfy bed. No Michigan Avenue views but  nice views from our room. Definitely a great choice right in the mix of things. One negative, thin doors. Be aware if you are a light sleeper.",5
384,"I've stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at Times Sq and I kinda liked it, so when I came into town with the giant Peepster, I booked this hotel. Great, great location. It was about 4 blocks away from the Rock n Roll McDonalds, which had a lot adjacent that was guarded 24/7 and only costs 35 a day and could take oversized vehicles. There was food everywhere, plus the room had a microwave and fridge [jackpot! ramen night!] I didn't really like the beds, at all, though I don't remember what the beds were like at the one in NYC but these had really uncomfortable duvet covers that were all scratchy, and the beds were weirdly soft, even when I adjusted it to firm. I'm pretty out of touch with my body so it's hard to tell exactly what about it I didn't like, just a kind of dull, all over ache that's probably about 25% the bed's fault and 75% my extremely labor intensive job's fault. Bath and Body works amenities! [I'm such an amenities whore.]",4
385,"These people went out of their way to make our stay great. We drove through the night from DC and arrived much earlier than expected. Mitchell and Hans (and the cleaning staff!) did everything they could and got us in our room by 10 am so we could get some rest before enjoying the city. The room was nice and clean. Great view, nice room amenities. The pool and hot tub looked great, although we didn't have time to use them. The restaurant attached to the hotel (Weber Grill) was fantastic, by far our best meal in Chicago! Hotel is in a fantastic location, within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see. Parking, a bit pricey, but to be expected in the city.  Great stay for a reasonable price!",5
386,"On the outside, it was pretty and well taken care of. Inspite of the construction on the corner of State and Grand, the exterior was still well swept, nary a noise was heard through the construction, and inside the lobby was wonderfully appointed. On the inside however, the hotel was suffering from the need for a makeover, much more than new beds could ever offer. It looked like any Marriott from the late 80's and 90's, our two queen suite even being overlooked by a Marriott hotel, likely giggling whenever we opened the windows, saying to itself ""Yeah. I remember when I looked like that. Good times."" The front desk employees weren't much help (aside from the Consierge). Despite a clearly labeled 3pm check-in time, our room wasn't ready at 3pm. In fact, it wasn't ready at 4pm when we'd returned to the hotel after a few drinks in the attached Weber Grill. The front desk employee who'd asked if she could help us rolled her eyes when I asked if our room was ready. ""Sir, we're very busy,"" she replied. ""Your room is marked as cleaned, but there's something they need to replace in housekeeping. Let me call them."" Two other people approached the desk and were told the same. I stood up after a half-hour and glared (I'm good at glaring) slightly. The girl, with a lobby full of people, disappeared for a while. The consierge, who's name I didn't catch, smiled and nodded at me. He cleared off a luggage cart and told my son (who's name he'd heard once in passing, which shames me more for not remembering his) to stand there, and he'd be right back. He disappeared for a few minutes, and came back, nudging me. ""Ask her again if your room's ready. I'll betcha it is,"" he said with a wink. I did. It was. We were on our way. As for the room? The best I can say is that it was a place to sleep. I certainly didn't feel as though I was in the lap of luxury, though for the price I paid, I certainly shouldn't, either. Still, their wannabe Sleep Number bed is for the birds. The lowest setting is just flat enough to emulate a more than worn-out mattress. The highest, firmest setting was marginally harder than concrete. The middle setting was non-existent. I didn't sleep well, but, I did sleep. Would I stay here again? Sure. If I were on a trip with family, I would absolutely stay here again. The pool was nice, if small. The attached food options and location are wonderful. And the staff that wasn't a front desk employee were amazingly friendly much in the vein of everyone else we'd met in the city.",3
387,"This hotel is definitely in a prime location on the mag-mile. That being said, watch out for the homeless people that prey on tourists over here after dark. Lol. That aside, the hotel itself is good. I mean, it's standard. Now that I've been living in Chicago for the past few years I have been to way nicer hotels, but for the price and the location, the Hilton Garden Inn has much to offer. The pool is very clean and the business center is completely accessible. The service was good and everyone was pretty friendly. Even at 5 AM when we checked out, the person on duty was very attentive and helpful. Also, I need to add that the Weber Grill attached to the building is definitely tastey and convenient. As far as I know, the Hilton Garden Inn does not offer as many local discounts as some of the other Hilton hotels in the area (like the Palmer House). It is nicely decorated, but isn't by any means any competition to the Wit, James, Palmer House, Drake, etc. I wasn't disappointed with this hotel at all and it offered some pretty fantastic views of downtown Chicago.",4
388,"The entrance to this hotel is literally steps away from a Red Line station, which was a blessing in -30 degree weather. While the hotel gym is small, guests have complimentary access to an actual fitness club near the hotel, so if you're staying in the cooler months, be sure to bring a jacket or sweatshirt to wear over your workout clothes for the brief jaunt outside. The room is a standard Hilton Garden Inn room -- well-appointed, clean, and spacious. Check for the AAA discount, as it saved me $30/night.",5
389,"Nice clean hotel, great staff and in a great location. Not sure about the sleep number bed review, mine was a plain ol' king.",3
390,"For it's location and it's price, the Hilton Garden Inn is not a bad place to stay. Located a few blocks from Chicago's Magnificent Mile, and also walking distance to other shops and dining options, where can you go wrong, right? Well, for one...because of all the above, I am sure lots of families like to stay there as was apparent by my neighbors and the sounds of their kids, the cartoons, and the occasional loud conversations either on the phone or just generally to each other.  I am sure the hotel can't do anything about this, but I'm just saying. Also, I am usually an easy going traveler with no specific requests for my room other than a queen/king-size bed.  But, I would appreciate that if I did not request for a handicapable room, you do not put me in a handicapable room.  I am sure it could have been put to better use.  And although I am aware that I could have asked for another room, I had already unpacked my items before I had realized this.  And to be fair and honest (and NOT mean), I just was not very comfortable in the bathroom as it was made for the handicapable (the toilet seats where rather high....I am particularly short), and the shower just a shower (like gym showers) to make it more accomodating for wheelchairs and such. And one more odd thing....what hotel still has a ""13th"" floor?  I know it's just superstition, but that still creeped me out a bit....cause that was my floor. Aside from that, the staff (front desk and bell men) were extremely friendly and helpful, and I loved how the moment you checked in you had an option to get 2 small bottles of water or 1 large one....complimentary.  I always hated those $4 bottle of waters other hotels try to force on you cause they know you'll be thirsty by the time you get to your room.",3
391,"I thought it was a great hotel for the rate we got.  Plus, it was a last minute decision to get a hotel out there for the weekend and it was pretty cheap for a 2-bed room.  I was thinking because it was downtown, not far from Michigan Ave that it would cost us a lot, but the room was 69.50 + tax it ended up being 86.50ish, and we split that in half with my friend and her boyfriend, so it was pretty affordable.   I was surprised that the room had a mini-kitchen that included a microwave and mini-fridge.  I didn't expect to see that, but very convenient if you had some leftovers you wanted to reheat for a late-night munchie.  When we checked in, the front desk was very nice and told us all the amenities that were available to us.  And when we checked out, they were bright-eyed and welcomed us down with a 'good morning'.   The room was good, the beds were a bit soft, but doable.  They had a nice flat screen to watch some late-night television and plenty of storage space.  The room served it's purpose and for the most part, pretty quiet, I will say the walls are pretty thin...I could hear the other room's TV going on.  But the price was nice and that's what we like!  The room was clean and we enjoyed our stay.  I can't really say how much parking was because didn't park our car there.  Luckily my sister lives out there and we parked our car at her place and had her drop us off at the hotel.  So, all in all, great place to bunk.",5
392,Great location and friendly staff.,4
393,"I was expecting typical Garden Inn service when I stayed here on business, but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff is excellent. Everyone spoke to me and went out of their way to ensure a quality stay. I even got to experience the event staff, as my business was conducted in the hotel's meeting space. The Food & Beverage service is five-star, and the guest room accommodations are top knotch. I will definitely stay here when I return to Chicago. Great location, great property.",5
394,"We decided to take a weekend and pretend we were tourists, hotel, museums, whole bit.  We found a reasonable deal at the Hilton Garden by checking prices and waiting until the day before to book the room.  It has a great location (grand and state) right by the Red Line L.  We were close to everything we could ask for.  The room was really spacious and all their beds are Sleep Number beds now, so its fun to play around with that.  There are a ton of families, usually coming to and from the pool, so we were never alone in the elevator.  Which inhibited us from getting the token ""mirrored ceiling in the elevator pic.""   In your room you'll find a menu of places that deliver, and you MUST order from the breakfast delivery place.  It's a RELIGION, and the true way to a woman's heart is good breakfast delivery. Well... this woman, anyway.",4
395,"Nice Staff, Starbucks on the first floor, early and late check in available---- this hotel was great, clean, and very central to everything that we wanted to go to. The staff is excellent--- very helpful. The concierge gave us so many recommendations for food and helped us plan our trips.",4
396,"This is the first place I ever stayed in Chicago, and I'd love to stay here again!  I checked in the first night and shared a regular double room with a friend.  We noticed that the room smelled a little funky, like wet horses or something.  Turns out the air conditioner was leaking water and the dampness had made the sheepskin mattress toppers start to smell a little... sheep-y.  We reported the issue in the morning and they very promptly and apologetically offered to switch the room. I was able to check into my own room at the same time, so they gave us two adjoining rooms.  I'd booked one of their ""junior suites,"" which turned out to be AMAZING - a huge corner room with a murphy bed, a full living room, a bar, and a kitchenette.  Add in my friend's room next door and we basically had a two-bed, two-bath living space that was bigger than a typical apartment.  The corner room had a breathtaking view of downtown Chicago, and I snapped a lot of photos at different times of day and night of all of the iconic tall buildings.  The murphy bed was pretty cool and actually quite comfortable for something that also folds into the wall!  I've stayed in fancier hotels, but this place takes the prize for a truly fantastic room. I had breakfast every morning at the Weber Grill, which has a pretty typical buffet to offer.  The hotel is close enough to a variety of convenience stores and supermarkets that you can stock up on some basics and keep them in the room.  I really liked the location and got a great deal on that suite when I stayed there.  I always check the prices when I'm coming back to Chicago.",4
397,"During a weekend getaway to the Windy City, my brother and I needed a cheap place to crash after our sight-seeing.  We figured a Hilton hotel in the heart of Chicago would be a safe bet.  We were wrong. The service and staff were top notch. The location was good.  Quick access to the subway.  Millennium Park and Navy Pier about ten minutes away.  All positives. However, the room was were things fell apart.  I agree with many reviewers that the walls were paper thin.  Very annoying.  Also, the ventilation was poor.   All in all, the room was a major downer. The price online seemed a good value.  However, after you add the cost of parking per day (not included) and the not-so great room, I felt ripped off. 2 out of 5 and recommend looking elsewhere.",2
398,"I recently stayed here for just one night, but I gotta say that Hilton Garden Inn's always impress me.  It might be because some people have a notion that the Garden Inn line of Hilton is their inferior brand.  I've stayed at several and they are actually better than some of the standard Hiltons.  I think it might be because most of them are newer properties. And yes, I am giving them 5 stars.  I know, I know!  It's not a luxury hotel like the Ritz or Four Season, but for a nice, newer hotel in the area that caters more towards a business crowd, it is one of the best I've been to. The lobby was really nice and modern and they are attached to Weber Grill restaurant that offers room service.  The check in was quick and the woman was super friendly and helpful. The room was great.  It was a corner room on a higher floor with nice city views to both directions.  The room was clean, had nice linens and decor, and also features a mini-refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker.  I love having those conveniences in a hotel room.  The bathroom amenities were Neutrogena. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.  You are just blocks to Michigan Avenue in the heart of the River North neighborhood.  You are also just blocks to the Loop just across the river.  Oh, and all that for just $145 a night.  Great price for the area and the quality.  I would definitely stay there again.",5
399,"Just like coming HOME!  We stay at the HGI when we are in GA to visit the grand kids and also stayed during a road trip in VA over the summer. Why oh why did I start this trip at the Allerton Hotel?  I was MISERABLE!  I guess I am just not an old hotel kind of gal so I gave ""notice"" and bailed on the reservation heading straight to HGI Chi-Town. Everyone here was wonderful (as is the case whenever I am at HGI) and the room is comfortable, roomy (the other place was so small my partner and I had to take turns moving from one area of the room to another) and I am now a happy HGI Camper!",4
400,"I have only stayed here once, but will return for sure.  The price was reasonable and the accomedations were fantastic.  Every employee was polite and greeted us in the hallways.  Check in was quick and we were given a corner room with no traffic in the hallway.  The room was clean and comfortable and had a tremendous view. I really can not wait to go back!",4
401,Moderately priced overall - well priced for its location.  Hotel room was on par with other Hilton Garden Inn's...but it's all about the location!,4
402,"When in town, this is where i stay, no exceptions.  Good price, clean rooms, great location.",5
403,Very good HGN in a fantastic location and not that expensive either. If noise does bother you then become a member of Hilton Honors. That way you can specify to be put in a higher level room and away from the elevator. This is what I do and I haven't had an issue.,4
404,Pretty good place but mostly for location. Considering the price that they charge there during busy times you might as well stay at the W or something that has more character. But can't beat the location... it's right in the middle of everything. Coming to downtown for some work meetings it was nice to stay basically across the street from where i needed to be.,4
405,"I love Hilton properties.  I just do. The best thing about this hotel is the pool.  The first 2 nights I was there, it was closed for maintenance, which was a disappointment, but when they reopened it, it was IMMACULATE.  Gorgeous, gorgeous pool.  It's not big enough to do laps or anything like that, but the whole set-up is very clean, very open feeling, well lit, and relaxing feeling.  One does not often find hotel pools this nice.  I intend to stay here again when I go back to Chicago for the pool experience.   Also, the room service is great.  the food comes from the Weber Grill restaurant downstairs and is very good.   My one issue is that I think there was a ghost of some sort who lived behind my walls and ceiling who made clicking noises at all hours.  If the ghost would have just shut up and let me sleep, the trip would have been more enjoyable. Oh, and also, the Grand train station is right there, which is super convenient.",4
406,"The Hilton Garden Inn is on the corner of Grand and State, a busy intersection with a Red Line ""L"" station. This is a relatively new hotel, so the rooms are standard-sized but still spacious enough compared to rooms at older hotels. There always seems to be small meetings held at this hotel, so there is a business-like atmosphere in the lobby. The Weber Grill restaurant is connected to the lobby on the main level, so the public restrooms are very convenient if you have to go.",4
407,"Attended a wedding and a formal event here - both were elegantly done and according to both planning parties - at a decent reasonable price, as well.  It's in a very convenient area with plenty of public transportation, as well.",4
408,"Had a small group meeting here. Hilton Garden Inns typically are great properties and really emphasize good service for a very moderately priced hotel. This location is ideal - the Hancock building was visible from my window, Nordstroms was across the street, the Weber Grill restaurant on site was quite good (and fun), and we were within walking distance of many other sights.",5
409,"Reliable, consistent good service along with great location and reasonable price make this a very desireable resting place in downtown Chicago. I'm still not sold on the Garden Inn adjustable beds, but aside from that it is clean, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the breakfast is hot and made to order. Within an easy walk or short cab ride of anything you want to do downtown, this hotel is affordable and suitable for business travelers or families on vacation.",4
410,"No complaints about this place, the price was right, the location was convenient (RIGHT off the Red line, few blocks from Michigan Ave, surrounded by restaurants, etc.) and the room was spic and span. I would def stay here again!",5
411,"The rooms were nice, and I didn't pay much to stay here, but there were a few things that were pretty annoying. 1.  The whole joint smelled like the pool.  Strongly smelled of pool. 2. The elevators were so slow, I thought it was a joke.  It was not.  I, at one point, caught an elevator going up just so I could eventually go down. 3.  The walls were paper-thin.  I heard children running, families talking (not yelling), a dude whistling in the hall through the door.  Worse, was the guy puking his guts out in the bathroom next to ours all morning.   If I had kids, I would stay there again and toss them in the ultra-chlorinated pool while I enjoyed some Webber Grill treats at the adjacent restaurant or took a nap in the very comfortable bed.  Since I don't, I will stick with nicer, quieter, more romantic places for now.",3
412,"The location is great. I use the red line frequently so you can't beat the entrance that's about 6 steps away from the hotel.  They also provide free internet in the rooms! No extra/hidden charges like Hyatt.  The staff and service was fantastic, the people were more than willing to help you out however they could. The walls are thin and sound certainly travels through the bathroom vents, as some have mentioned, but it's a hotel.. It happens. Also the elevators do run slowly during peak times. There's only three for a 25+ story hotel, which is definitely one short of the optimal amount, but expect it going in and it won't ruin your stay. The bed.. It's got that strange comfort foam stuff, which is cool, but I found that it doesn't bounce back very quickly, so I'd have to alternate sleeping on different sides of the bed. Not a huge deal, but for people who have trouble sleeping they might want to do some more research into that.",4
413,"I am staying here while my condo floor is being fixed.  I got a good rate through AAA ($186, not bad for Chicago).  The room is nicely sized, and has a refrigerator and microwave, which is one reason I chose the hotel--makes it much more affordable to stay here the week, I don't have to eat out for every meal (and there is a Jewel across the street and a Trader Joe's a couple of blocks away).  There is free internet access, perfect to feed my yelp addiction.   Business center is open 24 hours, and printing and computers are free.  I came here late last nite after the yelp event, and they let me check in by phone, which definitely scored bonus points.  They have a fitness center (3 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 2 bikes, free weights, and a multiuse weight machine for lat pulldowns, shoulder work, etc) and offer access to Crunch a couple of doors down.  They also have an indoor pool and hot tub.  Adjacent to Weber Grill, their room service is from there or Buca di Beppo.  Location is right at the red line, in the heart of or accessible to most everything.  Housekeeping was great this morning--I popped over to Trader Joe's for literally 15 minutes at most and they had come in and cleaned while I was gone.  Awesome.  Nutragena shampoo, conditioner, soaps, etc are a nice extra.",4
414,"Don't stay here, the you're better off going to the adjacent hotels for a better hotel stay and are more accommodating than the Hilton.  The Mariott and Hampton have been a better experience for myself and was just a little more money per night.  Paper thin walls that everyone can hear you and neighbors will complain when coming back from the night.  You only get one personal warning and the second time they come up they will kick you out by force.  We were literally in the hotel for 30 minutes before we were told we were being kicked out.  We were kicked out with excessive force by police after trying to negotiate with the manager who was stuck on kicking us out.  We had 8 police officers escort people who were quiet by the time the officers came.  Not worth the cost for people enjoying the city or even for business trips since everyone can hear everything.   I've already told our sales force to never book any nights here and instead, we go to the Marriott now.",1
415,"Great hotel for the rate. Wonderful location, the rooms were very clean. Our room included breakfast at the Weber Grill and it was well worth it.  We are picky about hotels and this was a very nice place for the rate of $215 a night.",5
416,This was the perfect hotel for someone who wants to be fairly close the action but cannot spend a fortune. I thought the rooms were nice and the employees were very friendly and helpful. The layout of my room was weird (the closet door opened right against the bathroom door) and the elevators were down a lot but overall it was a good experience.You are in Chicago so you won't much time here anyyway.  Be sure to ask the concierge about good places to eat they have coupons for many places. Also you have to eat breakfast at Eggsperience. It was eggcelent!,4
417,Great location!,4
418,"We enjoyed the Chicago South Loop Hotel quite a bit.  It wasn't the greatest hotel ever, of course, but it wasn't the crap hole that many reviews suggest.  The location is great...yes, it's a little bit away from the main part of downtown but you can drive there in minutes or take a bus up State St.  It's really, really easy.  Plus you can take a 10-minute walk to the train from here.  You can also walk quite easily and quickly to Chinatown.  We were staying on the South Side to go to the White Sox game and it couldn't have been much easier to get around and the proximity to stuff we wanted to do was great.   The service at the hotel was somewhat indifferent but certainly not rude.  When my card did stop working (due to having it near other cards), it was fixed quickly.  The room was quite huge and even had a lounge area in it.  That was really nice.  The bathroom was utilitarian and perfectly fine.  The TV was newer, which was nice.  The room had AC, which helped due to the hot weather.  Overall the hotel is pretty solid; there's a little breakfast joint in there and some other stuff.  It was great not to have to pay for parking.  When we were there we didn't have any issues trying to find a spot.  I would certainly recommend the place.",4
419,"Wow. Worst hotel experience of my entire life. I arrived here around 9:45 on a Tuesday night. I had to be up early the next morning and was just looking for a place to grab dinner, store my stuff, and catch a good nights sleep before a long days of work. Upon arrival (at the self proclaimed 3 star hotel) I was disappointed to find that it was in a not-so-nice part of town. However, I quickly got over the fact because all I was looking for was a bed to sleep on. When I got to my room, changed, and left to grab food, I noticed the door to my hotel room would not lock from the outside. I called the front desk and asked to either be switched to another room or to have someone come fix it. Unfortunately, the handy man didn't arrive until 11:30... which meant I was sitting in my room, awake, foodless, waiting for him to arrive. After he came it took him an hour to fix my door. I wrote an angry letter to hotel management the next day and got the room comped for the night. However, I was pretty upset because I wasn't able to sleep very well, which definitely affected my performance at work the next day. Anyways... all things considered I will probably avoid the Chicago South Loop hotel the next time I'm around... and I recommend everyone else do the same.",1
420,"Dingy, dirty and very poor location... DON'T DO IT!  We chose this hotel b/c it was close to the convention ctr and the pictures looked nice.  Don't fall for it... you'll be seriously disappointed.  It's worth some extra bucks and a short taxi ride to choose another location. The service is non existent.  All the staff we encountered moved at a snail pace and had a serious ""I don't care"" attitude.  Our room key stopped working, we had to wait until the manager got out of a meeting to fix it.  The rest of the desk staff stood around chatting about stuff.  Hello, we're paying customers, interrupt the damn mtg and give us some service. The rooms are dumpy and dirty.  My co-worker checked in to her room to find that someone had urinated in the toilet and didn't flush.   Really?!  There were stains on my bathroom floor and I would call the decor ""contemporary dingy."" The location is ridiculous.  There are no restaurants or bars for blocks... w/ the exception of the sorry restaurant/bar in the hotel.  In both the bar (they call it a lounge... HA) and restaurant, it felt like a bunch of neighborhood friends were hanging out.  The bartenders were chummy with their buddies and didn't give us the time of day.  We ordered one cocktail and two beers.  The bartender brought the cocktail and forgot the beers for almost 20 min.  My co worker went to go ask only to find the bartender singing karaoke.  Good thing his buddies stopped by for some fun!!",1
421,A group of us from Iowa stayed here for our Hawk Game @ Soldier Field (which was perfect) and had no idea what to expect.  Being we were not familiar with Chicago and the price for the room was too good to be true (compared to most in the area).  After reading some of the reviews we were a little nervous. We arrived hours before check in hoping to find parking which was very limited (due to the event) but we lucked out in the parking lot which thankfully was FREE!! Check in went great and the room was as expected.  I am not sure why some of the reviews complained about that- you pay for what you get? If you want luxury and high class you pay for it right? I thought the staff was great...they helped us with directions and check out was super easy.  We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Again!   GO Hawks!,4
422,"Found this hotel online and was not far from where my son is going to school. For the money, this hotel rocks!!!! Beautiful lobby; staff was great and room was clean and very big. I am not a nit picky person so I did not find anything to nit pick about. Maybe if I was staying at a $200 a nite hotel, it would be different. But again, for the money, this hotel can't be beat. We drove from out of town, and the money we saved in parking alone is worth it. There is a bar/lounge, cafe and gift shop. They even have an free internet cafe with hot coffee 24/7.",4
423,"Just stayed up in this hotel for a national conference being held at the McCormick center, the hotel is within walking distance from the convention center and also very close to the 29 bus that leads all the way down to Navy Pier. The room was just OK, it wasn't the nicest room I have stayed in or the worst. Guest services were always nice to us. The room was clean and looked like they were recently updated, but they really need to get HD TV Channels, and for thirty minutes one day the Internet was down. The water pressure in the shower was lacking as was the air conditioning from the unit in the room. Very easy also to get a taxi from this hotel, the only other thing is the restaurants from here were a long walk or short cab ride. One more note- the Internet access is unsecured.",3
424,"This hotel is a solid 3 star SOUTH of everywhere you want to be in Chicago.  That being said, be prepared for transportation needs.  We took our bikes which was way fun and not too far from everywhere in Chicago that you DO want to be.  Service was quite friendly.  No check-ins before 3 pm.  But FREE parking!  Can't beat that downtown.  Rooms were large.  Satellite TV spotty due to weather.  Awesome deep, big bath tub, comfy for two, adding potential to the romantic flare.  Hotel lobby had orange flavored water as a nice touch.  Beds were comfortable.",4
425,"Good news: check in lady was polite, room appeared to be clean, big shower, accessible to downtown Bad news: check out guy was extremely rude, allergic to room, subway system next to window, elevator at front door, and furniture very dated",2
426,"The place was ok... room was huge and the bed was nice! The service was relative rude when we asked to check in earlier than 3 pm (we were there at 2 pm) and they said we had to wait... so we took a 1 hr car ride to come back for a 15 min waiting line for cheeking in... so we werent alone... The parking is free but no1 checks if people from the souring areas use it. We went for a late dinner downtown and went we got back we didnt have parking... I had to wait for 45 min for some random spot to open and I had to rush because they were other 3 cars looking for space!!!!! I went back took a shower watch a bit of TV and then look to the parking lot from the window and one of the cars was still waiting (~3am). We woke up early (I dont sleep much) and the parking lot was almost empty by 9 am.... I wasnt too happy about this... Otherwise, is cheaper than downtown...",2
427,"Another non-snarky review from a proletarian Yelper-- The South Loop Hotel is quite a bargain and much nicer than some reviewers might suggest -- it has free parking!  The staff works hard to be pleasant and accommodating.  The desk clerk Kierra was very sociable when I checked in, and within five minutes of getting to my room, she called to be sure everything in the room was acceptable (I've never had that happen before).  At dinner, my waiter, James, was equally nice: when I asked him to wrap up the few remaining mini-corn muffins for later, he threw in a few extra from the kitchen--a great midnight snack.  The other few people with whom I had contact were equally helpful.  The whole staff--clerks, bartenders, waiters --  try hard here.  (And there's free parking!) My room was quite comfortable and spacious, and even though there is an el just a block away, the room was quiet.  The bed was quite firm, which I liked.  But others may find the beds here a little too hard.  The bathroom appeared to have been updated recently.  The bathtubs are rather deep, so be careful stepping in. The hotel is in an isolated part of Chicago, so you can't really walk anywhere.  But then, as I've said--free parking! I paid only $90 for the night.  Yes, I could have paid 2X (or 3X) that for an uptown room with minibar free Starbucks valet service room service in-room pedicures and gilt-edged Bibles in the night-stand.  But all I want when I stay over in Chicago is a room in which I can sleep comfortably and safely. And free parking.  And two hard-boiled eggs.",4
428,"Nothing to write home about, and could use some sprucing up, but clean and comfortable.  To be fair, we were not here under the best of circumstances -- sleeping the day away after a missed connection at Union Station -- but the service was generally friendly, and it was more than sufficient for what we needed.  Proximity to Chinatown means lots of interesting food choices, but no convenience stores nearby. Its proximity to the El is great for getting around Chicago, but not great if noise bothers you.",3
429,"I'm out of northern Ca along with a couple of other friends visiting a friend being a former Stocktonian and chosed this place based on the reviews on http://hotels.com and various other sites.. I would give this place a 4-5 star review, if they had their internet working AND that they do not have any technical restrictions using a wired/wireless router based on the MAC address of the device (mainly linksys and netgear, and tried all the tricks such as cloning the Mac address or spoofing it or forcing the router to act as a bridge), and that their staff (or this one tall clerk) was helpful and committing. Unfortunately it wasn't in this case. I'm just pissed that I brought a router for nothing as I'm finding out later that this hotels ISP have restrictions against bringing your own router and sharing the hardline with other computers, and that you can only go wired thru the hardwire connection. So we were going to connect thru the hardwire by plugging and unplugging the ridiculously hard to connect ethernet cable, then all of a sudden it went down too. But still I wanted to use the wireless linkys off the hardwire to use my iPhone 4s facetime capability to FaceTime with my family thru my dads iPhone 4 while out of state.... but didn't.. However, several other desk clerks told me the internet was through ATT, so I think they need to end their relationship with ATT and get another high speed ISP that will not go down, no matter how many tenants and what holiday. However, we can use their ""conference"" rooms internet wire connection. We'd have to have someone unlock it every now and then. OR there's the business center with 3 computers and its only those computers you can use and not plug in your own, but 1 out of 3 terminals As far as the room (double double queen), it's good enough for our stay. Had cable TV (no premium HBO or anything) and a nice small type of dining area with a loveseat and two chairs, and a small round table.. Bathroom was in good order, and had a 5th floor room with a good view. A couple of desk lamps have an outlet so you can plug in small things to charge like your phone or mp3 player. Speaking of outlets, there's probably more than enough and wasted some luggage space bringing my own power strip. An ironing board, dryer, and iron were all provided and all worked. Everything was clean, and no wrinkles or loose rolls in the rug, housekeeping does come by once in a while, though it's a Vietnamese lady so you're just going to have to point what you want or just say no thank you waving your hand shaking your head. Downstairs there's restaurants and a bar area. The bar area is fine, though we mainly went out to eat than going to the restaurants downstairs. This place is near walking distance of the CTA (red line, cermak/Chinatown). Anyhow, all I can say is don't rely on an internet connection at all if you decide to come here. Just stick with mobile web browsing on your smartphone using your 3/4g network or tether it to your laptop, use a 3/4PCI laptop card, etc. That's this hotels main concern. And we're probably not going to visit Chicago, IL for a while or never. I give this a three, at least its not run down hard like the Chicago Ohare Garden (which we mainly chose at first due to cheap pricing, but the reviews and content we passed; we took a brief tour on our last day, but didn't stay)",3
430,"Casing out hotels for my recent trip, I found out about the Chicago South Loop Hotel and liked the idea of an affordable boutique hotel in an up-and-coming neighborhood.  Unfortunately, the South Loop Hotel has jumped the gun by about five years.  New construction is happening but not in a block-by-block or district manner, but rather on random corners and lots throughout South Chicago.  As a result of this, the neighborhood in which SLH resides is not very walkable and doesn't have any retail shops, cafes or anything really to speak of that SLH guests can easily access.   In order to really experience Chicago while staying here, you'll be forced to cab it.  When staying at the SLH, you will do yourself a favor if you store the Chicago Carriage Cab Company's phone number in your cell phone (312-326-2221).  Their depot is literally one block to the west.  When calling the Carriage Cab folks, they'd arrive within five minutes and I was on my way.  Based on SLH's location, McCormick Place (for conferences) and Chinatown are the biggest draws that are closest...pretty limited pickings of what Chicago has to offer. Aside from its location, SLH is also less than satisfactory.  SLH doesn't promise alot of amenities on their website, but they didn't carry through on some of the things that they did state.  The most annoying of these was their lack of internet access.  According to their website, they have net access, but neither room or business center access existed.   Also, the walls were pretty thin, but this was tempered by the fact that not many guests were staying there.  The west side of the hotel is backed up to the El and the windows did little to reduce the passing train cars' noise.  Over time the El started to sound like a waterfall or a river, not the most bothersome of sounds.  Even their television channel selection was poor.  There are more disappointing things to mention, but the aforementioned are more than enough things to help you make an informed hotel decision.  The only service that was good was their housekeeping staff.  They did a lot of stuff for us that wasn't prompted and asked for, but ended up being really useful for us.   After a couple of days, we moved on to better digs.  While my review may make SLH sound like the worst hotel ever, it's just that I've definitely experienced much better.  If you have a conference coming up and you want to save some dollars on a bare bones hotel, this can fit your bill.  I definitely would not endorse staying here on their regular price.  Get a reservation on Hotwire or something similar.  That way, you can live with yourself for choosing the CSLH.",2
431,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. I would have loved staying at this hotel if I were on a high school or college road trip (its the cheapest hotel you can find this close to downtown), but as a professional adult there is no way in the world I would stay here again. Unlike what one reviewer said - there is a day spa, but its hard to find. It's the Kimberly Coleman Salon, which is located in the hotel (great salon by the way! see my review about that). The ""gourmet coffee"" snack people are horrible. The food isn't bad, but the coffee sucks and is way overpriced. The hotel lobby is nice. Its obviously new. But the rooms.... the rooms... the rooms....................are completely bare-boned, nothing extra. It looks like the furniture came from the 1980's, the TV channel selections suck, and worst of all.... the bed was hard as a rock. I'm not kidding!! I couldn't sleep on it. I pulled my air mattress out of the car and slept on that!!!! If you are planning to stay here for a convention, family reunion, church revival whatever - make sure to book using http://Hotels.com or something. As everyone has already said - this place is not worth the price if you pay the full value. http://Hotels.com had it for $79 per night when I booked - the hotel wanted $139. NO WAY!",2
432,"I stayed in the hotel over the weekend of Lollapalooza 2011. Yes, it IS a little bit out of the way (~20-30 minutes by train to downtown) and the nearest subway station is about a 10 minute walk. (Carmak-Chinatown of the Red Line). However, the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, well-maintained and spacious, and the hotel itself is upscale, clean and gorgeous to look at. I would recommend staying here. I would not recommend walking around the neighborhood after midnight by yourself, but my female friend and I walked home at 11 pm on two brightly lit, busy streets with no problem or harrassment. Some additional information about the hotel: 1. Helpful front desk. Want pizza delivered to your room at 4 am? No problem. They have menus for Sarpino's, a delicious pizza delivery place nearby. There's also a menu in room for Chinese food. They also called a cab for me at 4 am for the airport. 2. Huge lobby, bar, restaurant and general store for supplies you may have forgotten. 3. Business center with computers and Internet and a printer for use. Free coffee in the business center. 4. Huge rooms, comfortable beds, HUGE bathtub. 5. Friendly housekeepers. 6. 10 minute walk to Chinatown and nearest subway stop. 7. Bus stop right in front of hotel. (#29 bus) 8. Taxi stand in front of hotel. 9 Free wifi in rooms. And it was fast! Much appreciated! I very much enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay here again. The only downside is that it's further away from central downtown Chicago.",4
433,"The biggest downfall for this hotel is that it is nearly in the middle of no where.  It's a sketchy part of town, with Chinatown about 4-5 blocks away and the nearest L station about 6-7 blocks away... and I can honestly say these are LONG blocks.  If you plan on staying out late in the city after dark, you're probably safe taking a cab.  It can be pricey though, so taking a more expensive hotel farther up north... especially north of the loop is better. Room service is non-existent... although the hotel does advertise a pizza place and chinese place that you and order delivery from. The hotel's little sports bar is its only saving grace.  The crowd is upbeat and the drinks are great. If you're new to the city and aren't street smart, this isn't the best place to stay.  If you've been here before and are used to far south of the loop, it's definitely worth it!",2
434,"I check into the hotel because I missed a connecting train at Union Station. It was Amtraks fault and this is where they put me. I get into the room and the AC doesn't work. They have no more rooms and bring up a man to fix the AC. I called the front desk and ask if they have somewhere I can get some beer. A guy comes and tells me he'll bring some up. I give him a ten and he never returns. He DID tell me his name,  don't give your money to this brother.",1
435,Pretty basic. Good staff. Clean. Short 1 mile walk to the McCormick convention center. Quiet. Shower head and water pressure not that great. La Quinta grade linens and towels. It REALLY IS in the middle of nothing. You'll have to take a cab everywhere. Wireless internet is craptastic at best. You get what you pay for. Don't be a cheap bastard. Spend a little extra for a nicer place.,2
436,"Gah... I booked this place on Hotwire, which says it's a 3 star hotel.  No, it's not.  The restaurant doesn't exist yet (but it will Real Soon Now (tm)!), the coffee shop doesn't keep open the hours they have posted, and the whole place just feel abandoned. Let's talk about the ""services"" that are on their webpage: Continental Breakfast: No sight of it! Day Spa Services: Where? 24 Hour Fitness Center: There's a room with a treadmill and an exercise cycle. Gourmet Coffee Shop: ... There's a place that serves coffee.  Their hours are awful (and disagree with what they post), and the food isn't ""gourmet"" at all.  It's mostly packaged stuff they heat up for you at a premium.  Oh, and if you have any questions about it, the staff will gladly tell you that the coffee shop is a separate company and they have no idea about it. Gift Shoppe / Art Gallery: Worse hours than the coffee shop.  I've been here for three days, and I haven't seen it open yet. Meeting & Banquet Facilities: no idea. 24 Hour Business Center & Free Wi-Fi: There's a room with some computers and some printers.  The wi-fi is free, when it's working.  Unfortunately the staff know less about it than they do the coffee shop, and can only suggest using an ethernet cable (which they will provide, also free) if you have any problems. Limousine Services: They have the number for a limo company up front, yes. Wedding and Tour Packages: I've got nothing. Ample Parking: True.  This is because the place is abandoned, you and the other guest at the hotel have your choice of many spaces. Along with all of that, the staff seem like they're just off their game.  None of the rooms (I've unfortunately seen more than one) are well cleaned, and the hallways and common areas (except for the lobby) are in worse shape than the rooms.  It looks like there's been a fresh coat of paint by someone who lost interest before they finished (areas where the paint just... stops...). At the rate they're charging (~$140/night with tax), there's no way this is worth it.  At the hotwire rate ($60/night including tax), well, it's better. Finally, the area of town it's in is kind of sketchy.  It's close to Chinatown, and I expected to walk there for food and whatnot.  The staff strongly advised me against making that walk in the evenings or night time.  I did once at night, a bunch of times during the day, and it was fine.  However, I'm a large dude, and others might be less comfortable with it.  Once you get into Chinatown it's fine, but between here and there is a bit shady. I get the feeling that this hotel just isn't doing well enough to survive.  I overheard the staff saying that they had something like 50 rooms full this weekend.  That's close to 1/5 full.  Ouch...",2
437,"The Good: It's cheap, clean and away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago. The Bad: It's away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Chicago. That's pretty much it right there. You're literally on the edge of everything and to go anywhere, it's either a mile walk, or a short cab ride (something I loathe). There's no coffee service in the room, no room-service. If you want anything to eat, you either have to take a cab somewhere, or order delivery from one of the local establishments. For those, like me, who stayed there to save money on he Hyatt (if you're attending a trade show), it's a very brisk 15 minute walk/trot to the Hyatt, and if it's cold, I wouldn't recommend it. So far, the only real plus that most other casual traveller hotels don't have, is a really deep tub to soak in (that was nice!).",3
438,"i consider this hotel like the old bait and switch scam. it's called the chicago south loop hotel.  so i assumed it would be somewhere near the loop.  it is about a 15-20 minute bus ride south from the loop.   it claims to be a ""boutique"" hotel, which it is totally nothing like. the first night we rode in on the train and took the bus over to the hotel.  as we got further and further away, we asked a passenger next to us where to hotel was and if we could get something to eat nearby.  he suggested not trying to walk anywhere at that time of day  in that neighborhood and to just order pizza.  our first not so great sign. the hotel itself is like in nowhere land.  there is nothing within like 3 city blocks of this place. on http://hotels.com it is described as 3stars and the amenities included free wifi, continental breakast, a bar and restaurant and a internet/business center.  my friend michelle and i only got to use two of these, the others we found to be missing. the business room was two computers with internet and a copier from 1996.  they even wanted to charge for computer use. the bar was closed at 10pm the first night we arrived and was never open when we wanted to have a cocktail. the only good things we found was the bus stop directly across and chinatown is very close. i would have given more stars, if the website and description wasn't a total lie. because really, the hotel is a little bare bones, but it's fine for cheapness and just sleeping while enjoying the city.  i was really unhappy with the fog and mirrors in the description though. love, juston",2
439,"I stayed here for a night this past December. The room was OK, fairly clean and pretty spacious. I picked this hotel because of the price (one of the 'best deals' I could find for Chicago area hotel that didn't seem like a complete dump) and the somewhat decent reviews I found on the Internet. I was on the top floor (5th) with a decent view toward the city and McCormick convention center. The neighborhood is not the nicest but I walked around at night and felt fairly safe. There aren't really any restaurants or stores within walking distance. I did walk to a Walgreens and to Chinatown at night but it was quite the walk. Better off taking a cab or hopping on the ""L"" train around there (the train runs parallel to the street right in front of the hotel). The gym/workout room was OK. The Internet in the hotel didn't work several times during my 1 night stay. Nobody had any idea as to when it might be working again. Besides a restaurant and a bar, there is also a small coffee/sandwich place in the building but it was closed several times although the hours shown on the sign said it should've been open. There is also a small store and a salon. A word of advice....stay away from the bar in the hotel! I can't comment on the restaurant across the hallway but the bar (SL Sports Bar & Lounge) is a complete joke...if this place weren't located inside of a hotel, they'd be out of business in no time. I decided to eat there at night because it seemed convenient. Although 2 bartenders, the manger AND the owner were behind the bar, not one of them bothered greeting or even acknowledging me when I walked in or even after I was sitting at the bar for several minutes and the same happend with several customers who came in after me. To order something, it felt like customers had to either beg them for attention or get angry and cause a ruckus, despite the fact that there were 4 people working behind the bar and only about 12 customers in the place. The place really wasn't that busy and by no means trendy enough to have any kind of attitude towards its customers. It was a plain, no frills hotel bar. One lady next to me got so angry about the fact that she was continuously ignored by the employees, including the manager, that she asked to speak to the owner ""Tony,"" who then actually tried to weasel his way out of having to deal with her complaint by telling her he was not the owner, despite the fact that the bartenders had already pointed him out. What a joke...have some pride (or at least the slightest bit of business sense) and try to make things right. After he finally admitted to her that he was in fact the owner, he tried to play ""Mr. Smooth"" with her, asked what the problem was but, at the end of the conversation, still made no actual attempt to rectify the situation. The chicken sandwich I had ordered to take to the room with me sat on the bar counter for close to 10 minutes until I insisted that one of the bartenders check whether that was my order and so, naturally, it was cold by the time I got to the room to eat it. I didn't think you could screw up a simple grilled chicken sandwich but this place still managed to do it. It tasted like somebody had cooked it over a week ago and the fries weren't any better. The chicken breast was partially ""rubbery,"" partially dry and partially burned on the outside. Conclusion...you're better off eating a sandwich out of a vending machine than spending your money in this place.",3
440,The reason I am giving it 3 stars is my housekeeper was amazing.  She was there outside my room every morning and I could get anything I wanted towels what not.  When I first arrived I didn't have a do not disturb sign.  She was just walking down the hall and I caught her and she returned with one in no time. On the other hand the food establishment inside the hotel was lousy.  They cooked everything on Coleman camp stoves and hot plates plus it took over 45 min for a breakfast sandwich. On Monday when I got back to my room my key no longer worked.  So I had to go stand in line at the front desk. It seemed there was always a wait at the front desk. If you stay here make sure to get your reservation on http://hotels.com or Travelocity or what ever your favorite travel site is.  It will be cheaper than calling them.  I called just to ask about getting the same price they said they couldn't which I found odd.  But hey what ever floats their boat.  The price was very good for staying in Chicago plus free parking.  Our tab was $82 a night. It was near china town which was great because I love chinese food.  Plus it was only like a 10 min walk to the red line which I used during my whole trip.,3
441,"This hotel had everything we expected and needed. Ample free parking, room was clean and spacious, coffee available in the lobby, friendly staff. We stayed here the night before running the Chicago marathon which worked out well. Great value for the money.",4
442,"This hotel is located in a total wasteland in the middle of nowhere. There are vacant lots on three out of four sides. There are no businesses  within walking distance in any direction. There is no pedestrian traffic outside at any hour. If you don't believe us, check out Google Street View for this block. It gives you a VERY accurate sense of what this neighborhood is like. The people who work at this hotel seem to fall into two categories: rude+incompetent and nice+overworked+incompetent. The woman who checked us in when we first arrived was screaming at one of the hotel guests on the phone so loudly that it could be heard throughout the first floor. (She seemed to be trying to convey to them that their pizza had arrived. Why this required screaming we're not sure, but the tone she took with them was more than a little inappropriate.) The internet didn't work.  Neither the ethernet nor the Wi-Fi.  Their website advertises that they have free internet in ALL rooms. It was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel since we were here on business and needed it for work . We called down to see if they could resolve the issue. The woman at the front desk said, ""I'm not IT and it's a free service."" At $109/night (still overpriced ""discount"" travelocity rate) we did not think any of the very basic amenities could reasonably be considered ""free""; I mean, the bed was free too, right?  Needless to say she did not resolve the issue, although the next night someone else at the front desk was kind enough to let us test other rooms. Dragging our computers with us from one floor to the next, we tried three separate rooms before we found one where the internet actually worked. We then repacked all of our stuff and switched rooms. When we came back the next evening we were locked out of our new room for some reason and had to go to the front desk to get our keycards reactivated. Apparently this had happened to several other guests as well. So how is the rest of the hotel? One word comes to mind: basic. Industrial-pile carpeting, hard and horribly uncomfortable mattresses that seem to be covered with some sort of plastic underneath very starchy and coarse sheets, lousy water pressure, no place to put your stuff in the bathroom, no full length mirror. We didn't have a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in our room so housekeeping woke us up at 8:50 am on a Sunday morning. When we sent them away so that we could get dressed before they did up the room, they never came back and consequently we had to do without towels that day. There was such a disconnect between what we experienced with this hotel and what we'd read in some of the reviews that we wondered if maybe people had gotten it confused with some other hotel. The best thing about this hotel by far is the parking. The parking is free and convenient. There are pretty much always spots available. Other than that...",2
443,"So a month later, the issue with my sister's missing ipod touch was finally resolved.  It took more phone calls and emails over the ensuing weeks before anyone finally contacted me, which I still find annoying, but the manager claims that they did look into the issue and speak with the housekeeper, who of course denied everything.  Whatever.  All I know is they sent my sister a gift card to the apple store to replace her ipod touch so the issue is finally resolved, but I still would not stay there again.",2
444,"The rooms were clean, but the minute we walked into our room, our toilet was not working. It took 5 calls down to the front desk before they answered and took the guy 30minutes to come up to the room to fix the toilet. The service at the front desk, was extremely slow and rude. The line for check in was 6 people deep and there was only 1 front desk person helping. The restaurant that is downstairs was horrible, it took 65 minutes for them to bring us our food, never did they fill up our water or coffee, we just sat there, we would ask where our food is and the waitress would say, they were cooking it and would be out soon. We were so pissed that we just wanted to leave. we did not leave a tip and was not happy at all when we left. alot of the other guest were annoyed as well to how long the food took. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone that is on a schedule, the staff has no sense of time and does things as they please",2
445,"Hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating.  The rooms are very nice size and clean.  The rooms all have oversize Jacuzzi tubs, without the jets, but still nice since they are large enough for those of us who may like the extra room.  The neighborhood seemed a little bit dumpy but I never felt threatened or afraid.  The parking lot is fenced in but not locked up or closed in and well lit.  It is away from the main stream of downtown Chicago, but close enough that you can easily get there in a taxi.  For those that are unfamiliar with taxi's, chicago is one of the cheapest places to use a taxi.  I took the taxi from the Hotel to a restaurant on the north end for under $12.  You just don't find that anywhere. Did I mention that the parking at the hotel is free as well.  If you have a large vehicle they do have some street parking behind the hotel.  With the hotel on State street you can easily catch a metro bus as well to downtown, quite frequently.",4
446,"Finally a decent hotel on the southside.  I have not stayed there, but I had a friend stay there, and his room was just fine.  Definately not the best, but when you go to visit an awesome city like Chicago, all you really need is a clean place to lay your head.  Now to be straight up, this place is not downtown, and there is not much in walking distance, so be prepared for that, but if you are driving then this is probably a great spot (no $40 per night parking charge).  And also, the Sports Bar in the hotel, seems to be a nice gathering spot for cool African American urbanites.  I met some friends at the bar the other night to watch the Chicago/Greenbay game, and the place was packed.  Everyone had their Bears shirts on and were having a great time.  The bar staff seemed to be a bit overwhelmed, and the appitizers that they had sitting out NEVER had the heaters turned on, so they might want to pay a little more attention to that, but over all I think that this place has the potential to be the place to be.  No more running to the north side.  And I also noticed that they have a nice new restaurant, that I will be trying out in the next few weeks.  The atmosphere is awesome.   The hostess was very nice and gave some good basic information.  I sure hope that it lives up to its potential.",4
447,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and loved it! It is modern, relatively close to the highway and eaterires and very clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful.(especially Ms. Jackie). THe hotel appears to be newly renovated so everything in the rooms is new. The bathroom is large and mine had a garden tub in it. There is plenty of floor space in the bedroom area and ample mirrors to see how you look before you step out the door. Free secure parking is a plus too.",5
448,"Very nice clean hotel. Looked more like a 4 star than 3. booked using hot wire wasn't sure what to expect. The staff was very friendly. Very live bar in the main lobby area. George Clinton was even staying there when we were there. The neighbor hood is a bit ruff, however it looks like they are trying to redo the area. But the public transportation is right out the door bus is only 2 steps from door. I will be staying again great price right down town. NICE",4
449,"This hotel is decent, and certainly cheap, with the bare necessities. I stayed for 4 nights splitting a room w/2 beds with 3 other people.  There is no continental breakfast, but ""Awake with pearl"" sells amazing breakfast sandwiches.  The rooms don't have a coffee maker, microwave, or refrigerator.  The neighborhood is kind of desolate, and there are not many restaurants or shops around, but it's very close to the McCormick Place convention center. They lose a star because they messed up my bill, and some staff members were a bit ornery at times.  A good place to stay if you can do without the works.",2
450,"A very classy place to stay in Chicago.  Friendly staff and an amazing find!  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Might be out of your price range, but worth checking out since the amenities more than make up for it and they offer some awesome packages.  Worth the splurge if you want to experience Chicago and leave relaxed.",5
451,"went yo farmers market and not worth the effort let alone an admission fee. Thought it was a Farmer's market, hope it is not an indication of there services",1
452,"Shockingly bad service. I booked one of my salesmen for a three night conference here. I booked over the phone for him, and I have the gentlemen at the front desk the salesmen's contact information should the need arise. He briefly told me the times of check-in, but I didn't note them as being anything unusual. Come to find out, check-in here is between the hours of 3pm and 6pm EXPRESSLY. If you don't check in during those times, they lock the doors and their system cancels your reservation. My salesman's flight didn't even get in until 8pm, so color him surprised when he shows up to a darkened porch and a locked door. Jorge, the manager on-site came to open the door after a certain amount of noise was made and let him in begrudgingly. He told him he was late and that they assumed he wasn't coming. They couldn't call to check? To make matters worse, on my salesmans 3rd day, he returned to the hotel to find Jorge waiting for him with bad news. Because he checked in late and his reservation was cancelled, they had double-booked the room. The couple waiting to check-in to his room was currently waiting in the bar. He was given 20 minutes to pack and get out. When he asked Jorge to call him a cab, Jorge told him that cabs don't come to that area and that he would have to walk four blocks to catch a cab or a bus. HONESTLY! My salesman is a better person than I as he handled it with grace, but I am furious over the way he was treated and how the situation was handled. It's a shame too, because the space is gorgeous and we would probably use it again if it weren't for the ludicrous business habits of the staff. Stay away unless you plan to play by their crazy rules and pay their crazy prices.",1
453,"The Wheeler Mansion is an amazing bed and breakfast and has been such a great asset to the South Loop.  I was truly surprised they would go out of their way to hold a free Farmer's Market every week on their grounds.  The vendors were great, the music was great and a lot of tasty things to eat and buy.  Can't wait to go back and support every week!!  What a wonderful market at a classy venue.",5
454,"I came to Chicago on business and was initially supposed to stay downtown; however, a colleague recommended this hotel--and I am so glad that they did! The attention to detail and finishing touches in my room are what made this hotel feel like home. Staying in a smaller hotel allowed me to connect with the local Chicago vibe, while simultaneously enjoying exquisite service from the staff, at a fraction of what it might cost to stay in a Magnificent Mile high-rise. Considering the quality, ambiance and charm of this hidden Chicago treasure, it made my trip a memorable experience. Not only was I able to secure a bike rental to avoid the high cost of renting a car, but I also was directed to some of the local galleries in the West Loop by the friendly staff members.",5
455,"I stayed at the Wheeler last September with my wife. I contacted their office to reserve a particular room that we had stayed in on a previous visit. Stephanie returned my email and confirmed my reservation. However, when I arrived, I was told the room I reserved was unavailable, and that they would substitute another room. The reason the room was unavailable was because the entire hotel (except for the room they gave us) was being renovated. Now, I'm no fool. You don't just forget that you are renovating your entire hotel. They had to know the room was unavailable when I booked it, but they did not tell me until after I arrived and they had my non-refundable deposit. This is the worst possible service, deliberately lying to your customers. Although the room I was given was very nice (and larger than the room I asked for), my attempt to recreate a previous special getaway was ruined. I really wish I could give them a higher rating, because the mansion is very beautiful inside, and the rooms are extremely comfortable. The breakfast in the morning was also great. Everything about the place is relaxing and luxurious. This could be such a wonderful place to visit, but I don't feel I can recommend it to anyone because of their current management. Edit: I have been informed that the Wheeler is now under new management. The building and amenities were always four stars in my book, and so I now feel comfortable recommending it for special occasions. I have adjusted the rating from two stars to four.",4
456,"The good: - The units are large. The living room was nice. The bed was comfortable. It was good to have a refrigerator and microwave. The bad: - Parking was outrageous (over $50 per night) - Poor water pressure - Although nice to have, the microwave and fridge were scuzzy Things that other people may find good, but I found terrible: - It was chaotic. There were kids running around everywhere and lots and lots of people milling about, mostly waiting in crazy long lines for free cheap alcohol. There must have been a pool, because there were a lot of dripping wet, scantily clad people everywhere. Kind of gross.",4
457,"When I looked for a hotel downtown near navy pier and michigan avenue, the Hilton Embassy Suites kept popping up with pretty good reviews.  I found a price that I could live with in a downtown hotel and it had a free breakfast.  I decided to take a chance. What I got was a corner suite with a lake view.  It was immaculately clean, spacious and away from the noise.  The king bed was so comfortable and I slept through the night for the first time in weeks.  The ""free"" breakfast was not just free, it was darned right awesome.  One line led to an omelet station and home-made egg orders, while another buffet line of eggs, bacon, and pancakes suited several fares.  Fruit, cereal, juices, fresh coffee, donuts and toast and more and it was all free.  THe manager said they served up to 1500 guests a day, so get there early.   BTW, the restaurant manager, Vadym, is fantastic.  He not only sets the tone for the friendliness his staff is known for, he sets the tempo for detail and work ethic.  His staff are constantly patrolling the seating area hoping to help by clearing dishes and whatever they can do to make your stay even better.   We highly recommend the Embassy Suites Lakefront for your next stay.  Keep in mind, there are two embassy suites downtown chicago and many different hotels with the Hilton connection.  But there is only one Hilton Embassy Suites Lakefront with the great breakfast, great staff and manager's reception that others have mentioned.   Truly a gem worth visiting.",5
458,"This review is for the Manager Reception:   Embassy Suites has the best deal in the hotel industry. It is the Manager's Reception. What the Manager's Reception is, is a 2-hour Happy Hour from 5:30-7:30 P.M. With a hotel key, hotel guests have unlimited alcohol beverages at no cost from 5:30-7:30 P.M. plus snacks. The alcohol drinks range from draft Budweiser to Bahama Mamas and Blue Hawaiins (my favorite). All drinks are served by personable bar tenders. And not only are there drinks, there are  snacks. My favorite is the tri-color tortilla chips with salsa (served on certain days).  I rate the Manager Reception 5 stars. If you are having a bad day, by two hours the Manager's Reception should change your bad day into a great night.",5
459,"Came here for a bachelorette party and it more than met our needs.  The rooms were well sized, especially in order to accommodate our entire party.  The biggest bonus areas for this hotel is the cocktail hour and breakfast served in the morning.  Though they give cards for both these times, in our experience none of the bartenders checked for them before serving the beverages, meaning we could get back in line again and again for a new, fun cocktail.  Fabulous!  The breakfast was similar.  It had a great amount of choice, from hot eggs, bacon, pancakes and potatoes, to cereal, breads, muffins, oatmeal and then made-to-order omelettes, as well as biscuits and gravy.  Though, it's important to take note that the made-to-order line can get extremely long, especially on weekends and later in the mornings.  If you don't want to wait, go early on stay during weekdays.   Only complaint here is the noise that can be heard from inside the hotel room.  Because the entire hotel is set up around a large atrium, any activity in the lobby, or any hallway can be heard from inside the rooms.  For a light sleeper, this can cause some issues, so sleepers beware. Otherwise, this hotel was a great deal for all of the perks they offer and somewhere I'd definitely stay again, especially for a girl's night or weekend.",4
460,"First off about my perspective in reviewing this hotel.  I love value and convenience.  I hate lines and crowds.  I am also a fan of Embassy Suites, so I am taking into consideration my stays at other E.S. properties. We stayed here for the final two nights of our family vacation trip, and I picked this hotel for its central location in downtown Chicago, the free breakfast, and the overall price / value compared to other nice hotels in the area. When we arrived it was a little confusing.  After parking in the public parking garage (E.S. does not have its own parking, although you can do valet), and taking the elevator to the Embassy Suites / street level.  Around the corner was the bell / valet counter, and then around the corner from that was another elevator to take up to the lobby level.  Although the atrium is huge, the front desk area is actual somewhat cramped when waiting in a long line to check-in.  Finally, 20-25 minutes after parking we were able to take the third elevator ride up to the room.   The room itself  was spacious and comfortable , with a set-up typical of an Embassy Suites.  It is a huge hotel with a vast atrium in the middle.  Overall this is a nice property.   One of my favorite things about Embassy Suites is the free, made to order breakfast, however, the first morning, going down to breakfast, I was frustrated to see a massive line for the made to order.  So I decided to forego it and just do the buffet.  There was a good selection and the food was fine, although finding a table was a challenge.  My oldest son did wait in line for a omelet -- took over 20 minutes.  The next morning I made it a point to get up early; the line was shorter, but still almost took 15 minutes.  Interesting, also, the helper asked about what sides you wanted, and put them on a plate before the omelet was started, so they were cold before the omelet was finished.  Along the same lines, we went down for the evening reception, and the line for drinks was just as bad as the omelet line  -- not worth it to me, considering the idea of having a drink is to relax -- waiting in line for 15 minutes is not relaxing.  Perhaps the hotel is too big for every thing Embassy Suites promises. A couple other things.  I will never understand why I can pay $59 at a Super 8 and get free wi-fi, but a $250 hotel needs to charge $15 / day -- not per room, but per device (we decided internet could wait).  Also, we heard voices from other rooms while in our room. Overall, the stay was fine, but for what we paid, I did not consider it a great value.",3
461,"I have stayed here a few times and my experience has been mixed. On the plus side, the hotel has a gorgeous lobby, with great views of the city around it.  It feels bright and open, much more so than most cookie cutter Embassy Suites. The rooms (suites) are nice and standard, and staff has been courteous and helpful on all occasions.  The pool that is right off the lobby is nice, as is the jacuzzi. On the minus side, the lines for breakfast can be atrocious, especially on weekend mornings when families stay at the hotel.  I am talking about 20 or 30 minutes buffet lines - forget about ordering a custom breakfast.  You really need to be there at 7 AM to avoid the lines, but that means you need to alter your schedule to account for the hotel's inability to handle a crowd.  The same is true of the evening reception - lines of 15, 20, 30 people to order a drink - frustrating. So I can recommend the hotel, but if the complimentary amenities are a reason for choosing this hotel, be prepared to dedicate extra time.",3
462,"The location for this hotel is perfect- I love staying here when I come to the city. The people who work here are friendly, and are very accomodating. The last time I stayed I arrived two hours before check in and they let me come in early with no fee. On another occasion they kept my luggage safe for me when I got there early and the room wasn't ready. The lobby and rooms are great- I've been here for a romantic getaway and also for a couple of girls trips and the rooms are great for both. The complimentary breakfast and open bar hours are also fabulous perks of this hotel. It is my favorite place to stay before a Bears Game!",4
463,"Going to Chicago on a weekday makes life better. We stayed here and no lines for drinks at the reception. The staff is friendly and the room clean. It is is your typical Embassy Suites and for the money,it works. If you want turn down and chocolates, go to a fancier place.",5
464,"Great visit to the Embassy Suites. The staff were incredibly friendly, the food was quite good, and the room was clean and comfortable. Location is fantastic to downtown as well as the CTA to get around town. Only downside was the ability to hear some noise between rooms. Not overly loud.",4
465,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location was great. It was within walking distance to most everything: Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile and Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due. We had a beautiful view looking over toward the river and the Wrigley Building. I stay at Embassy Suites whenever I can and find them to be consistent in quality where ever they are. This location was no exception. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. The hotel staff was helpful and attentive to our needs. We had a wonderful stay.",4
466,"My review from http://yelp.com: I don't get to vacation too often. I think the last one I went on was 5 years ago. Earlier this week, I stayed here for my very first grown-up-all-by-myself-vacation. I booked a room for 4 nights two months ahead of time so I could get a really good rate. I only spent $89 a night. I booked through the Embassy Suites Hilton website, not through Orbitz. For a Downtown hotel, I wasn't expecting too much. And I was a bit frightened that it would be a bit gross. Apparently, that was NOT the case here! This is one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed at! I know it's not super-fancy, but it exceeded my expectations! I stayed in a 2-room suite with a flat screen tv in the living area and one more flat screen in the bedroom, a sofa-bed in the living room, Crabtree & Evelyn shampoos and soaps, plentiful towels, 2 additional sinks (one in the bedroom and another near the microwave and fridge), self-fluffing pillows, a very clean bed with clean, soft sheets, free cooked to order breakfast and a free 2-hour evening reception at the hotel bar! The free breakfast and the evening reception isn't over the top, but it's free! I'm so happy they at least offer it! The breakfast was very good; you can choose what kind of eggs you want or get an omelet, and they also sausages, bacon, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, cereal, english muffins, donuts and other baked goods, fresh fruit (melons, bananas), yogurt. They had an awesome selection in case you don't want what they are cooking. I personally thought the omelets were pretty good. And there is a swimming pool, jacuzzi, and sauna. The kitchen staff, bartenders, and housekeeping staff were all very nice and they made sure I was taken care of. Seriously, who could ask for more?!?!?! There is only 1 downside, wifi isn't free. It's $14.95 a day. It is free if you are an HH member. But it is worth it if you pay in advance for a lower room rate. I would definitely come back again and again for a quiet weekend. Or maybe a week. I love that Fox & Obel is around the corner too in case you want gourmet eats without spending too much $$$. But that's for another review....",5
467,"Nice hotel with big comfortable rooms.  Parking is really expensive (~$44 per day to self-park w/o in-and-out priv., ~$53 to valet w/in-and-out priv.), but not out of the ordinary for the area.  The hotel begins on the 5th floor of the building, where the Sky Lobby is located.  Rooms go up onto the higher floors from there.  So, from the street, you should expect 2 elevator rides and a walk across the Sky Lobby no matter where your room is.  The location is very good, near the river, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Lake Shore Drive, Tribune Tower, NBC Tower, and the Chicago Loop.  They are well within walking distance to most of those places and plenty to do (plus, plenty of places to eat).  I did not take advantage of the bar, the manager's reception, or the breakfast.  However, the breakfast did look pretty busy, so keep that in mind as you read other reviews mentioning it. My only real complaint about the hotel is their keys.  If you insert and remove the key too fast or too slow, it won't work.  It's hard to gauge exactly how to do it right, consistently.  I heard others complain about this, too, on the elevator.  After a long day, when you're really tired, the last thing you want to have to do is fight with your room key.   Other than that, highly recommended.",4
468,"Four solid stars because of the price, customer service, the fact that every room is a suite, they provide free breakfast in the morning, they have free cocktail and snack hour at night and the hotel is in the heart of Chicago.",4
469,"I came here with a group of girls for a bachelorette party.  We met up at the Embassy Suites and hung out here for a while until everyone was ready to head out to the club.  The suite was nice and spacious.  I really liked how there is a covered area for cabs to drop you off and pick you up.  My only complaint about the hotel was that the bathroom in the bar area was closed for renovation which was a pretty big inconvenience.  Also, the smokers in the group were not very happy that they had to go down two sets of elevators to get outside for a cigarette.",4
470,"I'm staying my way through all of the Chicago downtown Hilton properties when I visit, so this Embassy Suites is the latest one!  Convenient to Navy Pier and a variety of shopping and restaurants, it's well-located and transit-accessible.  It's important to specify that this is the Embassy Suites on Columbus when you get a cab, by the way, because there's another on State Street and people get confused!   This is a ""sky hotel,"" meaning that the lobby and rooms are all on floors 6 and higher.  You get some pretty nice views, but it also means that you have to catch more than one elevator to get anywhere!  Luckily, they have enough elevators and they move pretty fast.  The lobby and central ""courtyard"" (like nearly all Embassy Suites have) is really quite spectacular and modern.  The lobby does have a bit of a chlorine funk, either due to the fountains or the hotel pool.  The bar and breakfast area are right by the front desk and very convenient - the hotel offers a free breakfast and nightly ""manager's reception"" like other Embassy Suites properties.   The rooms were a little dim for my tastes, without good lighting at any mirror to do my makeup.  Otherwise, very standard suites.  Living room/dining room area, wet bar, separate bathroom and bedroom.  Three sinks in total... one bar of hand soap.  I'll never get that.  The wifi is free for elite HHonors guests.   I'll keep trying different properties - I think my favorite so far has been the Hilton Garden Inn, followed by the other Embassy Suites on State.",4
471,"This hotel is lovely. I love the elevator and how you can view it from the outside. Its pretty kewl. The rooms are nice and spacias and the windows are really cute. The complimentary breakfast was tasty and there was a lot of options. We order room service, mainly finger foods, and everything was just right! I didnt hear any sex noises in the middle of the night, which is good! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone planning to stay in downtown Chicago for a few days.",4
472,"Good, not great. However, I'm a Hilton Honors member and their WiFi never did work.",3
473,"Very clean hotel, and the breakfast was excellent for a free buffet. However, you better hope that none of you have to stay in the front room right on the atrium.  It's like an echo chamber, and the hotel does not seem to care if people run and yell at all hours of the night.  I stayed Thurs-Sat night, and had to call and complain about the noise both Fri & Sat nights.   Also, on Sunday check out there was only one bellman working.",3
474,"Really loved my stay here especially after my stay at the Sheraton across the street.  The rooms are newly renovated so they are fairly new and set up like an apartment with a living/dining room and separate bedroom.  There is also a microwave, sink, and fridge which has lots of room for you to buy snacks or drinks, etc. and not full of overpriced liquors you don't want to buy.  There is also a Dominick's/Safeway right across the street so there is no reason not to stock your fridge.  There are tv's in both rooms so I'd be great for a small family to have some room to spread out. The atrium in the middle of the hotel brings in a lot of light and the glass railings are both cool and scary!  The extras that they throw in are what made me love my 3-day stay.  Free breakfast buffet, free happy hour from 5-7, a free US weekly newspaper at your door in the morning, and really nice Crabtree and Evelyn shampoos and soaps (this seems basic, but lots of hotels don't give you free shampoos anymore). Oh and they have an internet room that has free printing so you can check-in to your flights or check email.  All of this for less than what I paid for a single room at the Sheraton which was decent, but nothing special.  (No free anything at Sheraton!  Not even good soap!)   I have to admit I didn't have the breakfast here as I was too busy, but the fact that it is offered is a total plus in my book!  Yes there were lots of people in line during breakfast, but I asked a couple how the food was and they said the make your own omelets and fresh fruits were good.   The bell hops and valets downstairs are also curteous and friendly.  They will help you with your bags or get you a cab in a second.   One tip -- get your hotel on http://priceline.com for the best deal ever!",5
475,"I couldn't believe the price when I booked a suite here for me and five others. The rooms are not the most spacious, but for the price, it's great. And the location was perfect. They were located a few blocks from everywhere we wanted to go. To your left is the Art Institute of Chicago, Aquarium, Grant Park, Buckingham Fountain, and more. To your right was the Magnificent Mile shopping area, tons of restaurants, Chicago Water Tower, and John Hancock Observatory. Although we weren't directly located next to anything, it worked out perfect to me in close to everything rather than closer to some places than other. Another perk was that we located right across from Dominic's Pharmacy. We walked there regularly for snacks. Saving the best for last, the absolute BEST thing about this hotel is: - Complimentary breakfast buffet every morning. (Time varies by the day) - Made to order omelets of your choice. - Complimentary happy hour w/ chips & salsa and other snacks. - The nicest bellperson(s). Greeted everyday entering and leaving. And were very helpful with any questions we had. Other perks that I didn't take advantage of: - Indoor pool. - Gym. - Lounging area in lobby. I highly recommend this hotel! My friends and I were very pleased with our experience.",4
476,"I stayed here for Lollapalooza weekend - it's close to the north location of the festival and just a block away from Michigan Ave so very convenient. The closest L stop is Grand-Red which is a few blocks away. Staff was pleasant but not overly friendly - I appreciated that the front desk staff found an available room before check in time and everyone was helpful when needed, they just didn't go out of their way to make nice if that makes any sense. Rooms are standard Embassy Suites with the separate bedroom and living room. The bathrooms were roomy and the towels were the nice big bath sheets which is always a plus. Complimentary breakfast was just okay - when the hotel is sold out like it was the weekend I was there, the lines are long and they run out of things fast. But if you're patient, you can pretty much get whatever you'd want for breakfast. They also have the complimentary evening reception with snacks. I'd stay here again but can't really give more stars since I wasn't wowed.",3
477,"Embassy suites has some nice rooms with decent beds.  With the suites you get the seperate room which isnt much use in Chicago since you shouldnt be spending much time in the room anyway.  There is free breakfast here and a managers drink hour which isnt worth much either.  The breakfast is below average and you have to wait in a line across the lobby to get a free drink.   The location of this hotel is great with plenty of great restaurants near by and very close to Michigan ave, and the Navy Pier.   Dont plan on parking your car here since it is about $50/night try to find parking near by.   If you stay here skip the free breakfast and head over to Yokes which is awesome, also go to Joes steak seafood and crab for a great dinner",4
478,Nice place.  You get what you pay for.  Free booze from 6-730.  Free full buffet breakfast all morning long.,3
479,"I had a pretty darn good stay here over the course of two nights. The location is not quite as convenient as being directly in the loop but it is very close and near enough to many shops, restaurants, cafes and the lake. The value proposition here is two fold: firstly, the room, or should I say rooms, give you more of an apartment style set up than a typical hotel room. The key here is that because you have a living room and a kitchenette area separating your bedroom from the hallway, blocking out the vast majority of noise from passer-bys. My bed was huge and comfortable. I had a view of both the lake and the city. The second area they really stand out in is the extras: all you can eat breakfast, and a two hour complimentary happy hour in the evening at the bar. Combine this with a 24 hour fitness center, a pool and sauna and it is pretty difficult not to enjoy your stay here. The staff, especially in the dining area, were exceptionally friendly. As for the drawbacks. The carpet was ugly and the interiors themselves were drab and in need of an update. The fitness center could use an update too. The style of Embassy Suites means you have a view of the exterior of all the rooms all the way up to the top floor from the lobby. Because they all look exactly the same you get the feeling of looking up at an old tenement building in a former Soviet bloc country. The hotel is very, very kid friendly, which means it may not suit all business travelers. Summary: This Embassy Suites meets and exceeds expectations on every level except the aesthetic side, and even that was not so bad. I would definitely stay here again.",4
480,"Positives: close to many attractions, free breakfast and managers reception, very nice staff Negatives: $41/day parking, needs a little TLC Stayed for the long weekend with family. If we had to get somewhere and feed breakfast for the nine of us, would have been time consuming and expensive. You could have cooked to order omelets or buffet style scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, biscuits and gravy. Also had a managers reception with free drinks and snacks. Was nice to unwind after being out in the city all day. Some minor issues with soap rack in shower loose, toilet seat loose etc. I know that it is expensive to park in the city but at least cut something off for staying at the hotel vs. just parking there. Easy walk to shopping, site seeing or dining.",4
481,"Stayed at this hotel at the end of the year to check out the fireworks at the Navy Pier. The hotel valet enterance is easily missed (on a one way street), but made it in the 2nd loop. Also the valet area is very crowded with people checking in and out, as well as cabbies. We waited for a few minutes before we could pull in. (Our car blocked the drive during check out, but we were prepared to load up and go. So only about a 3 minute hold up...) Upon checking in, the car was moved safely into a heated garage space by the valet (yes we snuck out and checked later). The hotel registration is up the elevators to the right. After we cheked in, we went up to our floor, and was welcomed by a grand view (see posted picures to see what I am talking about.) Already mentioned in a lot of other reviews, but... 1) Cooked-To-Order Breakfast (6:30am - 9:00am) is basically a tailored omlette your choices of spinach, chedder cheese, ham, bacon, jalapenos, peppers, onions, sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes. I just went for everything! 2) Managers reception (from 5:30 till 7:30pm) is basically free drinks and appetizers (chips and fries). A nice perk. 3) The room has a bedroom with either two full or one king (we stayed at the one king room suite) and a door that separates into the living room with a pull out sofa bed. (I heard that it was on the stiff side, but hey I didn't have to sleep in it.) 4) Pool, gym and sauna (6:00am till midnight) are available for people who want to work out. I went for couple laps at the pool, and used the sauna. Very refreshing in the morning. 5) Walking distance to main shopping area of town (i.e. Michigan Ave.). 6) Navy pier is two blocks from this place. A great place for a family visit Definitely a great family hotel, and if the rates meet my budget, definitely will stay again.",4
482,"Wonderful experience.  This is not the most luxury hotel out there, but you definitely get the best value .They offer free breakfast and happy hour drinks.  The interior view is very unique. Rooms are clean and nice.",5
483,"We went here to meet my boyfriend's mother for drinks. When you enter on the street level, whomever the gentleman working the desk was, was rude and abnoxious screaming, yes I mean screaming, at somebody inside. We thought he was yelling at us. We asked for instruction on how to get to the lobby and he remained unapologetic and angry. Anyhow, we wandered around and realized we were at the wrong Embassy Suites (Monopoly : Another Embassy Suites is 4 blocks away). This Embassy Suites does not have a working waterfall fountain at this time.",2
484,"I stayed here for 3 nights and while it's not the best hotel I've stayed at downtown, it has some perks. 1) Free breakfast. And I mean a full breakfast, including cooked to order items. I didn't take advantage of that, but they had pancakes, bacon, eggs, pastries, breads, etc. It can get really busy so it might be difficult to find a table at times. 2) Big rooms. It was very nice to have a separate living room and a bedroom with a door on it. The rooms also had a mini fridge and microwave. 3) Super comfy beds. I mean seriously, they were awesome. 4) Convenient location. 5) Fast elevators. This can be a challenge at some hotels, but the wait was never long here. I definitely wouldn't pay full price for these rooms, but if you get a good rate it's a nice place to stay. If you're looking for luxurious, go someplace else.",4
485,"Shatangi had a blast at Embassy Suites. From day one, the staff went above and beyond to accommodate even the smallest request. The suites are well maintained and very clean. The breakfast is outstanding. I am amazed at the efficiency of the breakfast staff. In the PM, the bar staff that run the manger's special take the time to get to know you and always remember your order (remember to tip them well) even if the snacks are kind of costcoesque. It was a great opportunity to touch base with my colleagues and see them well liquored. Overall, a great stay in a well-run and well-located hotel. Shatangi told you...",5
486,"For an old building, this Embassy Suites is very well maintained and has been remodeled well.   If you ever want to see how old the hotel is...go down the stairs and check out what that's like...they never repaint or remodel stairwells.   The rooms are spacious (another clue that it is an older building) and laid out well....your standard ES....but still excellent.  The open atrium Embassy Suite trademark...makes it noisy at times in the living room...especially during happy hour or during a party.....but the bedroom in the back of the suite with it's locked door...takes the edge off the noise.  Four people can stay in this suite and not feel cramped at all...plenty of room for even 6 people.....if they let that many stay in the room. The included breakfast and happy hour...wine. beer and snacks...is very welcomed if you are on a per diem or budget.    One dinner downtown can set you WAY back......That takes the edge off staying downtown and its high prices. Breakfast is the best of any of the suites hotels around the country.   The highlight is the omlette station.   A chef prepares a custom omlette for you .   You pick out all the ingredients like peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, bacon, sausage, ham, cheeses, etc.  With that you also get fried potatoes or pancakes.   Quite a wide range of selection.   There is also a large fruit area to get all your standard fruits...melons, apples, oranges, bananas, etc.  There is a danish/donut/pastry tray as well as cereals and oatmeal.   Apple, cranberry and orange juices are available as well as all the coffee.   In downtown Chicago, this would easily be a $25 to $30 breakfast if you eat alot.   Everyone in your room gets this breakfast as part of your room rate.   In addition to the breakfast is the free happy hour as well.   All the wine, beer and sodas you can drink in 2 hours as well as appetizers.  The wine is one grade above screwcap bottled wine.   Beer is standard Miller quality.    One night was puff pastry mini hot dogs and cheese balls.    The next night was buffalo wings and meatballs.   Again, in downtown Chicago, you drinking a few beers or glasses of wine plus these appetizers could easily set you back $20 to $30 per person.  However the quality was not good for the appetizers....2 stars....most of the dishes were way too salty. My only complaint here is that many times no one answers the phone ...either the operator, concierge, front desk.   They get overwhelmed frequently.    I just hope an emergency doesn't happen here and I can only call out to get help For downtown Chicago at the lakefront area, Embassy Suites is an excellent place to stay, especially if you are travelling with a family.  I like this place much better than the Sheraton up the block.",4
487,"Just returned from a family vacation in Chicago. I have two active teenagers and this hotel served us extremely well.  Great location for a vacation, centrally located to most downtown activities.  The staff was helpfull and responsive to our needs.  Every employee seemed to enjoy thier job.  Breakfast was decent in quality and great in quantity.  Rooms were big and clean, great for a family.  The fold-out couch was just ok for a teenager but would have been very uncomfortable for an adult. The tv's were difficult to operate. Lots of families and lots youth soccer teams enjoyed the hotel so the noise level was high.  Not a place for a quite getaway but fit my needs of a family vacation.",4
488,"You could do worse.   Through a very strange hotel mix-up, i.e., budget cuts, I got booked here instead of my regular hotel.  At first, I was a big old cranky bitch about that - I travel regularly, so I have certain expectations, and I have to be here for 5 nights.  Ordinarily, I don't want to be staying in an Embassy Suites for 5 nights in ANY city.  It's nothing personal - they're just great for a night or two, then that's it.  Any more than that, you need a little TLC.  And, when I first walked in, it reeked so badly of chlorine that I thought I was going to pass out.  Not a good first impression. But, the bed is comfortable, they are keeping it clean, I have a lot of room to spread out, I have a great view of the city, and there is a really nice Dominick's market across the street that is keeping me well stocked in the snacky-time  essentials (Pellegrino, almonds, and fruit!  OK, OK...and Twizzlers.  Lots of Twizzlers.)   So, I think it's a matter of keeping your expectations in line - and for that, it's fine.  Walking distance to Michigan, close to everything - not top of the line, but certainly not bad for the price, especially when you're travelling on business.   However, if you aren't paying the tab, and the economy's not in the crapper - it ain't The Peninsula!  Just sayin.",3
489,"Spent this past weekend in Chicago and stayed (with 4 ""young adults + husband).  Booked two rooms, the kids stayed in one, hubby and I in the other.  There was plenty of room, even with 4 in a room.  Kids complained that pullout sofa was uncomfortable, as most of them are, but in the end, they slept pretty soundly as evidenced by the fact that we had to wake them up each morning!   The real draw for us was 1) location - within walking distance of Navy Pier, Michigan Ave. and many of the major attractions, and 2) free buffet breakfast and happy hour.  Buffet breakfast was pretty eh, the made-to-order breakfast (omlets, etc. are a better option) and the nightly happy hour gets so crowded you almost WANT to pay for your drink if it makes the line move faster.   Also, don't go there looking for top-shelf - it ain't happening!  They really should figure out some way to make this run more smoothly.   This property is somewhat older, but it is in very good condition; rooms and public areas were very clean and service was top-notch.  We arrived about 2-1/2 hours before the 4pm check-in, but the rooms were ready and they allowed us to check in early.  The elevators are a little on the slow side, particularly during the breakfast buffet and evening happy hour, when everyone seems to be wanting to travel at the same time.",3
490,"I usually don't review hotels in YELP (at least not yet) but I figured I would  for this one since I stay here so often. Embassy Suites Lakefront is my 'go-to' hotel when I stay in Chicago. It's in a great location if you need to be downtown. It's short walk to either Navy Pier or Michigan Ave, or just a short cab ride away to most other places in Chi-town. The hotel staff is very friendly across the board. The rooms are all pretty good and the hotel is clean. If you're a Hilton Honors member, be sure to ask if they have any corner rooms available, for they usually have larger living rooms than the traditional rooms. Their morning breakfast buffet is quite good with a lot of variety. Probably one of the best Embassy Suites breakfasts available (trust me, they're not all created equal). The made to order omelets are worth the (short) wait. The evening Happy Hour is also a nice plus and a great place to unwind or congregate before heading out to dinner. If heading to Chicago for a few days, be sure to consider this as an option for your stay.",4
491,"I had my wedding here last month and couldn't have been happier.  My contact, Brooke, was a doll.  She was always there to answer questions and made sure everything was the way it was supposed to be on my bid day.  We booked about 25 rooms for the weekend and everyone seemed pleased.  The remodel of the rooms is gorgeous.  They are very nice.  You really can't beat the free breakfast.  Since they don't collect the coupons we joked that we were going to go there every weekend for breakfast.   I deducted one star because we got a free room the night of the wedding. They made it seem like this was some fancy suite and it wasn't much different than the regular rooms and they made a huge deal about getting us into it.  Which I still don't understand.",4
492,"Very modern hotel, beautiful sky ceiling to look up to from the lobby.  Looks nice inside and out.  The lobby bar has free drinks from 5 to 7pm, which would have been nice, had I not been working until 8:00 most nights I was there!  The free breakfast is made to order omeletes with sausage, hash browns, bacon; other dishes include hot oatmeal, fresh fruit, bagels, toast, and yogurt choices.  Starts at 6:30a.m.   Rooms are all suites, which makes it nice and roomy for two, and decent for a third or fourth person.  Plenty of closet space and an extra sink in the master bedroom.  Two tv's make it nice when sharing or if entertaining.",4
493,"I'm usually not a fan of the big conglomerate hotel chains and much prefer the smaller local places... but when i looked it seemed that this was the most bang for the buck.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The hotel has an updated style and a modern feel.  The check in was a little confusing to me, but that's probably b/c i live in a place that doesn't normally have basements and such.   The hotel lobby has a modern water - statue thing that was pretty neat looking till my bf said that it resembled an urinal... uhm, there goes that modern feel!  lol.  nevertheless, my initial take was that the lobby was clean and comfortable. The suites are well maintained and clean.  The bathroom was updated with granite counters; unfortunately, they didn't update the whole thing and the wall paper was peeling a little, but it wasn't a huge deal.  Otherwise, the bathroom was fine. Love that they had a microwave in the room, esp. with all those HUGE Chicagan portions!   Really loved that they have a managers reception with free drinks and snacks at 5:30 - 7:30.  Helped me finish some reports before i starved to death before dinner!   The gym was ok, on the small side, but it had most of the equipment one needs.  The pool was a lap pool, but there were kids in the pool that didn't treat it as such, so i didn't try it out. Breakfast was fast, lots of choices.  Overall, a great location, great price and good service.  Only thing keeping from the 5 star rating was that the business center was incredibly small (3 computers, one printer) and they charge for internet which i think is ludicrous in any hotel!",4
494,"Embassy Suites is always perfect for families.  The suites are large enough - two full beds in one room, and a pull-out in the other (yeah - you'll need a back re-alignment in the morning).  Microwave and fridge included.  They have a managers reception (read free beer/wine) downstairs in the lobby, but it never really appealed to me - lines seemed way too long - no thanks.  The cook-to-order breakfasts are a big hit with the kids and easy on the wallet (included).    It gets fairly crowded so you should probably get down there early (8-9 am).  The pool is small and heavily chlorinated - so take advantage of the free skin exfoliation. Kids loved it, and if the kids are happy . . . .dads happy. Location is great - especially if you want to walk along Michigan avenue pre-Christmas.  Navy Pier is also just a couple blocks a way. Careful when ya travel - especially around holidays and breaks - during these periods make no mistake about it - this is a FAMILY hotel.  If you go expecting a nice, romantic, quiet evening - you will be disappointed.  It's wide open and loud, and kids are everywhere.  That can be good or bad depending on your status.   For us, it's perfect for travelling with kids.",3
495,"The beds were comfortable enough and the location is nice for downtown happenings... We had someone trying to sleep in the ""first"" room, on a Friday night, and that was a mistake, as the lobby stayed pretty loud, and a group of drunken revelers tried to get into our room at 3 in the morning... they finally did manage to get into the room next door, and the walls are pretty thin. $15/day for internet is completely unacceptable. Breakfast was ok, especially for the price (free) but the cooked-to-order stuff is the way to go. The buffet offerings don't stay warm or get refilled often enough... you have to get lucky.",3
496,"I enjoyed a 2-night stay here over my birthday weekend.  It is a nice hotel with extremely courteous employees and clean rooms. In addition to the great employees, the breakfast each morning was great - and this is coming from someone who isn't a big breakfast eater!  Seriously, all these complaints about it being busy are RIDICULOUS.  Obviously it's going to be a happening place with all the options you have - scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, omelettes, cereal, donuts, pastries, yogurt, fruit, soda, milk, juice, pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns... How could you not be happy?!  I was there on a Saturday and Sunday morning which I assume would be busier than weekdays and both times had no problem finding tables. Now on to my cons... Parking.  Parking is $49/day.  That's probably normal for Chicago hotels, but still... that's murder, and a very pathetic way to spend $100. Exercise room.  The room is TINY and has like 5 cardio machines (3 treadmills and 2 ellipticals or something like that.  I really don't remember since I didn't get to use anything).  For a hotel of this size, that's ludicrous.  I ended up going for a jog outside in rainy, 50-degree weather which wasn't ideal, but whatever. Room issues.  None of these ""complaints"" are a big deal, but I'll share them anyway.  The sitting area/office room that you walk into is pretty big.  It has a flat screen tv, desk, etc.  (No free internet...)  And then there's the bedroom - it's small, or at least seems small thanks to the huge bed.  There was probably a foot of walking space on each side of the bed so it wasn't easy to do anything but sleep in there.  I left my suitcase, got dressed, etc in the other room.  Also, the tv in the bedroom is the old cube type...kind of strange to still see those, especially with a newer tv in the other room, and what was even stranger was the extra sink in the bedroom!  So random. Also, taking the elevator to the lobby then the lobby elevator to the ground floor was interesting, but nothing to hold against the place. 5 stars - 3 stars for cons = 2 stars plus 1 star for an overall good experience and being a ""good deal"" (minus the parking) for a total of 3 stars.   It was fine, but I'm not sure I'll stay here again.",3
497,"I really like this place.  I went here with 11 of my friends last weekend and we reserved three rooms.  These rooms are suites so they are much bigger than  regular hotel room!  Pluses included that there was a sitting area (plus a pull out bed in case), plenty of sinks (one in the bedroom, one in the sitting room, and one in the bathroom), fridge, good breakfast, and free drinks in the evening.  And we also hd a party in one of the rooms after we came back from going out...and it fit everybody. The location is also pretty good.. two blocks from Navy Pier and two blocks from Michigan Avenue.  And it's much bigger than the other Embassy Suites in downtown. The biggest thing I didn't like was the check out time was 11 am.  Way too early in my opinion.  Also, the check in time was 4 pm.. a little too late.  But they have a great concierge service to leave your luggage with them.",5
498,"This turned out to be the perfect hotel for a spontaneous weekend trip in the city. We got a great last-minute rate on a two-room suite with a lake view, and the place itself is within walking distance from Navy Pier and Michigan Ave - perfect for someone who's just looking to chill out and enjoy Chicago without having to figure out how to commute from point A to point B. The free continental breakfast is okay, but I don't think it's as impressive as some previous reviewers mentioned. Definitely eat there before you start your day, but don't expect a gourmet experience! I would recommend skipping the free happy hour cocktail because everybody bum rushes the little bar at that time.",4
499,"As a loyal Hilton traveller, I would rate this the better of the two Embassy Suites in Chicago. Still, I guess I have a thing with them because I feel like there's a cost you pay for having a suite and having free breakfast. The workout room is slightly above average, the breakfast is pretty good and the staff is quite friendly. Big negative in getting a smoking room, though I didn't mind that much since it didn't smell. Also, negatives for not recognizing my status (yeah, I have it so I'm officially that guy) and for making me pay for the internet. The manager's special is a nice touch, though you only get well drinks and draft beers. The food is slightly edible. I guess I'd come back here, but still want to try other hotels in town first.",3
500,"Good reasonably priced hotel, rooms are clean, bed is very comfortable, 5 pillows - love that.  rooms are suites so very large for one or even 2 couples. Very close to all the Downtown action. Watch out for rooms with no cell phone reception, $15 wifi and $50 parking. Overall very enjoyable.",4
501,"Good location, right near Navy Pier. Great view from our room facing the lake. However there was NOTHING fancy about the room, it was the exact one you get at a Country Inn & Suites suite for a lot less. It was weird to have to take an elevator to the lobby, then another to the room. There were kids everywhere. Too many kids, you would think there was a water park in it or something. I'm a Mom myself but this was a kid-free (our own at least) girls trip with 4 of my friends (we all fit in the room fine btw) and I wasn't in the mood to deal with apparently orphaned kids running amok, with parents nowhere in sight. A group of 4 or 5 kids decided to sit on the floor in the hallway  in front of their room 2 doors down from us and hang out. At 10:30 p.m. We went to use the Jacuzzi, it it was full of..you guessed it, kids. More like teenagers but still kids! Also at 10:30 p.m. I called the front desk, who said they would call security and make them leave since kids weren't supposed to be in there. Went back down and there they were. UGH! We never did get to use it, or the narrow tiny pool (also brat filled) Waited FOREVER to get a drink at the manager's reception (didn't mind though since we brought our own drinks from the room, and by the time we got to the front they had been drank.) The drinks were gross, my friends' apple martini was disgusting! And I have never been known to turn one down. I slept through breakfast but my friends said it was good. Nice building and location, but I wouldn't go back.",2
502,BUSINESS ONLY.  Other than the friendly tip hungry Italian evening bartender - this place is all business.  Large desks that you can work long hours at.  The front room is quite a nice office.  8am is like a herd of cattle as high heels and luggage rollers rattle down the hallways as coffee slugging kids who take their jobs too seriously rush to another meaningless seminar.  There is a lack of warmth to this place and I only stay here when working long hours.,3
503,Good value. Really easy to get to off Columbus from Lakeshore and close to everything. Wifi free to HHonors gold.,5
504,"This hotel has a good location close to the lakefront, Navy Pier, and Michigan Avenue; all are less than a 10 minute walk. away. There is a large supermarket right across the street, so for an extended stay you can get drinks or snacks to keep in your room. Extensive and high quality breakfast buffet included in the room price. Internet access is costly ($15/day); it should be included. The only complaints I can muster are (1) accessing the street requires using two elevators and a short walk; the guest elevators reach a ""sky lobby"" at 4th floor level and then you then have to go to another elevator to get to the street and (2) it's not near public transit; taxi fare from Midway is about $30 and from O'Hare about $45, or you could take the trains to Union Station and then a taxi for about $10.",4
505,"Thanks to Chicago yelpers, we were here last week. You get a 2 rooms suite with free breakfast and free drinks at night. The breakfast is a good spread and it is the same menu everyday. You have the choice of 1 line with cooked to order omelets and biscuit with gravy or 2 lines with already made tray of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries potatoes and pancake. You can also get oatmeal, dry cold cereal, english muffin,toast, small danishes, donuts,oranges, banana, yogurt,coffee, tea, orange juice, cranberry juice or apple juice. The drinks at night is from 5:30 to 7:30 PM. The snack items are the same every night: nacho chips with salsa, peanuts, yogurt pretzels, raisins, banana chips, trail mix. and  sesame sticks. The kiddis drinks every night is cherry sprite, lemonade,sweet tea or orange slices in water. The place was packed with kids. It is nice to have 2 TV sets and an extra room. It is about 6 blocks to the CTA station. You have to check in on the 5th floor. PJ Clarke is right on the property. Walgreens is down the street. Dominicks is right across the street. Close to everything but not near anything. We were down for breakfast before 8 AM and never had to wait.",4
506,"Stayed here for five nights - didn't have a car (thank goodness). I think it was the time frame we were there but the hotel seemed to have a lot of families.  Nothing wrong with that, just take it as a comment.  I'm more used to staying in hotels that were more business people or couples.  When you add in a bunch of children it changes the dynamics a bit. Breakfast -- Crowded but seemed to work itself out.  You either went early or went last minute.  If you wanted the ""made to order"" then you would need to be there early (tips are accepted).  The cook was amazing.  Also amazing were the people who cleaned up after the hordes.  These folks kept tables cleaned and new people got tables. The food was broken into three areas.  Made to order, hot dishes (eggs, bacon, pancakes) and then continental breakfast. Kudos to Oscar -- always had a smile and kept tables moving... Rooms - Ours had a comfy bed and the rest of the furniture was a hodge-podge.  The televisions had a limited number of channels and the only pay per view worth watching was ""The Kings Speech"", but why spend time in the room.  There was a fridge and a small microwave.  You will have to borrow some plates/silverware for your food. Dominicks is across the street so you can get food from there if you really need it. Evening food/drinks -- yep, it's there.  Nothing to go nuts over (no pun intended).  Small drinks (beer, wine) and some mixed drinks.  You save a little with not going to a bar but it depends what you like.  Munchies were of the nuts, salsa/chips variety. Noise -- even with the noise of the families your room isn't that bad.  Yes you can hear them next door but if they aren't the party type then all is good.  Put the TV up a little. Elevators -- very fast Internet - go across the street to Dominicks or down the street to Panera Bread and use theirs.  Also there is a business center on the ballroom floor that you can hook at cat5 cable into and not use the wireless but it is a small room. Workers there were very very nice -- even with the rude tourists.  I never saw them lose control.  Even the mother who dumped orange juice all over the place and proceeded to yell at everyone.  They cleaned it up and kept things moving.  I like the people there. Would I go back, sure, if the price was good.",4
507,"By far, one of the best deals on a nice hotel in Chicago.  My mom stays here when she comes to visit, and after seeing some of the other hotels she has stayed ta in the city this is by far my favorite.  The rooms are two room suites, which give you tons of space.  Free breakfast with made to order omlettes, yum- I tried them and they get 5 stars for sure!  Free open bar from 5 to 7 I think.  This hotel is blocks away from Navy Pier and blocks away from Michigan Ave.  I think the average price for a night is about $115, which is super cheap for downtown.  Very clean and all of the staff seemed very pleasant.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a nice hotel on a budget right downtown.",5
508,"We had a wonderful time here.  My husband, I and our almost two year old son took the train from Kansas City to Chicago.  This hotel was just what we needed to spend 4 days in Chicago.  The hotel itself is pretty.  The room was beautiful.  It had a separate bedroom that can be closed off.  It had a little fridge and a microwave which was perfect for milk and snacks for our little boy.  They also provided a crib.  In the morning, there's a build your own omelet breakfast.  It was really nice.  it's not your typical continental breakfast.  My favorite was the happy hour.  Every night from 5-7 or so, most of the drinks at the bar are free!  Yes! I said free.  You can just lounge around the bar/eating area sipping a cosmpolitan martini munching on some nuts or chips and salsa.  The best part was that this hotel is close to everything.  I mean walking distance to the The Miracle Mile, the Pier(which was awesome)Childrens museum... For the price we paid, we definitely got our moneys worth at this great hotel.  And, would recommend it to anyone staying in Chicgo.",5
509,"The rooms were okay. Honestly, the bedrooms were probably smaller than the living room area. It wasn't the nicest hotel I've stayed at, but it definitely wasn't bad. I like that this place has a free breakfast buffet, free drinks at the bar from 5:30p-7p, and location.",3
510,"This modern Embassy Suites features very fast glass elevators, so just riding up to your room is cool. Look down upon the atrium space to the main floor below. The rooms are all mini-suites, and the buffet breakfast is a big spread. The hotel is connected to a large movie theater complex and is not too far from many of Chicago's attractions, though it not really next to any of them.",4
511,"Have stayed at many an Embassy Suites in my time from coast to coast, this one was disappointing.  Now mind you, did get to stay free due to Hilton points, but meh is meh and would've been pissed off if I were paying!   The hotel is based on the older models of Embassy Suites, ie. the prison cell block model where all the rooms are squared around the central atrium look.   On the positive side: Two blocks from Navy Pier and two blocks from Miracle Mile.  Walking distance to a few other things too. Grocery store across the street was cool for getting stuff to put in room and a Walgreens a block away. On the negative side: It was crawling with little kiddies of which one we heard crying at night through our room walls (very thin walls I think), the room had no safe or makeup mirror, it had a sink in the bedroom which I thought was rather odd, it took a hella long time for them to bring our bags up after we checked in, they say it takes 20mins to get your car out of valet and for you to call well in advance, OMG you could hear the drunks at the atrium bar at night even with our tv on (the sound just echoed up 10 floors), front desk only had 1-2 people working it at any given time and the concierge was not very helpful or friendly when she was there - which wasn't often, this was the first ES we've been to where they had signs up in the elevators telling you what times breakfast would be more crowded than others, and let me tell you about that!!! Made to order breakfast often had a long line unless you hit it just right and all I saw people get were omelette's and bacon, sausage, and potatoes.  Breakfast was THE SAME everyday!  Two buffet lines with eggs that looked and tasted like powdered eggs, bacon and sausage links, pancakes, and yogurt.  Also watery oatmeal, 3 dried cereals, lots of donuts, and toast and English muffins.  One buffet line had food that was always not warm and you only got orange or apple juice as your choices.  The managers reception in evening was alright. Cell phone reception was zip in our room and valet parking with in and out privileges was 49$ but self park without in and out was 42$.",2
512,"I've stayed at the ES twice now, both for business. The rooms are very clean and modern looking. The front desk staff is quite helpful. The location is great for walking to Michigan Avenue and nearby attractions. A taxi ride to Wicker park for instance cost me about $6. The breakfast each morning is good, although I didn't care for the eggs. The gym is small: there are 4 treadmills and a small variety of free weights. I would continue to choose the Embassy Suites Lakefront as my hotel of choice when visiting Chicago.",4
513,"We had our wedding here and it was perfect. For a downtown location, it is very reasonable. We worked with Thelma and she was so wonderful. The room is a little narrow and long, but that is my only issue. The staff was so nice and they dealt with many of our annoying family members with tons of grace. They did have a light malfunction that no one could fix, but our dj set up a make shift lighting arrangement with his equipment. It actually looked pretty cool! Overall, our wedding was wonderful and The Embassy Suites had a lot to do with that!",4
514,"Stayed here a couple days to see the city before going to MI for a wedding.  A suite that sleeps 6 (but 4 comfortably) for $149 was great. Very convenient downtown location, close to many things, including public transit (we took the bus, train and free trolley - which was sadly discontinued by the city yesterday).  There was a fridge and microwave in the room, which came in handy after visiting Chicago restaurants, which served Chicago portions.  (Also to keep the beer cold - buy that across the street at Dominick's/Safeway.) We stayed over the X-mas/New Year's holiday and the place was swarming with kids.  It made the manager's reception (free select drinks and bar snacks for a couple hours) a little difficult since half the bar line was ordering ""kiddie cocktails"" aka Shirley Temples.  A staff member commented that the place was always like that when school's out.  The breakfast was also a little chaotic, but worth the wait.  Cooked to order omelets and biscuits & gravy were hits with us.  The pool and hot tub are open until midnight, which was nice.  Parking at the hotel was expensive, so we used cabs, public transit and walked as much as the cold allowed. Surprisingly, the hotel charges $10/day for WiFi, so go across the street to the Starbucks inside Dominck's where WiFi is FREE.  Also, you don't get to opt out of housekeeping, which was a little weird.  And the ceiling fan was disgustingly caked with dust, which was also a little weird.",4
515,"We stayed here last weekend. Loved it. Great rooms for groups. When you enter the room there is living room area with a couch, chair, and table with two or three more chairs. Across from the bathroom was a kitchenette with sink, microwave, coffee maker, and mini fridge. Bedroom was a good size with two beds, sink, and mirror. The alarm clock comes with a plug to hook up your ipod. The beds are really comfortable, I slept like a rock. Our room was on the 12th floor and the view was amazing. It is also worth mentioning the elevators are made of glass so the view from them is pretty good too. We did not have any of the made to order breakfast so I can't comment, but the other stuff was well put out and no lines. We do the managers reception (did see long lines) either. The lobby was crazy Sunday morning, mostly because people were checking out, long waits for the busy elevators. Pj Clarks is just off the lobby, great for drinks and late night eats. There is also a pretty cool bowling alley and sports bar, and an AMC movie theater right next door.",4
516,"I was offered a free room for a night by someone who could not use it so who am I to say no to a free suite just 2 blocks from my office?!?  I got there just a few minutes before the cocktail hour was ending so I had time to get a drink, go upstairs to my room and go back down for 1 more before they closed for the night.  Cocktail hour(s) also includes some goodies to snack on.  The suite I had was okay, it looked out at the Sheridan and NBC Towers.  The sitting room had a chair and couch that were not all that comfortable and seemed old to me.  The bed was really comfy but I can't stand feather pillows so fortunately there were about 20 pillows on the bed.  The bathroom was an average size, towels were thick but not soft or large and the shower itself was pretty big.  Breakfast is really good.  There is everything from made to order omelets to a hot buffet consisting of eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, potatoes but also the cold stuff like bagels, cereal, yogurt, donuts, muffins, etc.  The lobby is really quite big seeing that they have 2 events for guests that require use of the lobby, plenty of tables, chairs, and couches but seemed ""cold"".  I did not get a chance to use the fitness room or indoor pool (which is actually quite small).  Overall, I could not beat the price!",4
517,"For the amount of money we paid, this was a great hotel.  The hotel is located only a couple of blocks from Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile.  Our suite had a queen size bed in the bedroom, as well as a convertable sofa in the living room.  The living room also had a flat-screen tv.  While all of these amenities were nice, in my opininon, the hotel's best feature is the complimentary manager's reception from 5:30 to 7:30 each night.  For two hours, they offer their guests free well drinks and free domestic draft beer, as well as free chips and salsa to snack on.  Needless to say, we took full advantage of the hotel's generosity during our three night stay.  Depending on what night of the week you are there, there may be a bit of a line for the drinks.  This was the case on a Saturday evening.  We quickly learned that the best way to deal with this was to get our drinks and then get back in line.  By the time we finished our drinks, we were at the front of the line and could order more.  The hotel also offers a complimentary breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30 on weekdays and from 7:00 to 10:30 on weekends.  We never woke up in time to make it to breakfast, but apparently they offer made to order omelettes.  Ironically, I think our taking advantage of the complimentary evening reception may have in part contributed to our inability to make it to the complimentary breakfast.",5
518,"At one time or another I've stayed at nearly every major brand hotel in the Loop and this property would rate in the top 20% in terms of staff, value and location. The staff couldn't have been more pleasant, from the front desk to the bell and door folks, they were simply nice people to be around.  The property itself is a good value considering the great location.  The room was clean and nice, not extravagant, but I don't always need extravagant every trip.  Very happy the WiFi worked well, which is not often enough the case everywhere.  Free breakfast was... well free.  As is often the case the guests can descend like wild beasts when free food is involved, so no surprise with the feeding frenzy and it's not the staff's fault it can get crazy in the dining room. (Hint: Rick Bayless's XOCO is one block away if you want a phenomenal breakfast) In short, you're unlikely to find better lodging at this pricepoint downtown.  I'm quite sure I'll make a return visit.",4
519,"I am not *quite* sure how to write this review yet.  My friend had booked us a block of rooms for a GTG we all were having.  There were about 8 rooms used, and I guess they were all supposed to be suites, there were supposed to be refrigerators in the rooms, and there were supposed to be microwaves.  I personally, just got a double room, and I guess nobody else had a suite, either.   And my friend got the paperwork in on time while going through the worst time in her life.  So Hampton Inn and Suites, PLEASE get your act together. All of that being said, there were a lot of great things about the hotel.  The complementary breakfast was comprehensive and wasn't lacking anything.  The rooms were comfortable (slightly small).  It was in a good location.  And when I called down and asked for a fridge for my leftover pizza, they waived the $10 charge for it. I wish I could give a better review because the service was outstanding, but they just didn't earn it on their end for the lack of customer service in the room-booking department.  They needed to hold up their end of the deal.",2
520,"Clean, nice hotel.  Way more than I expect from a Hampton Inn.  But beware, IT IS SO LOUD!!!.  They even give ear-plugs in the hallways to help with the noise. There is a police/fire-station nearby and the sirens blare all night long.  I couldn't take the noise and had to use the ear-plugs.  Other than that, the experience was great.",3
521,"This is a wonderful hotel with a friendly staff and outstanding service.  Tracee at the front desk was wonderful.  The rooms are large, beds are comfortable with a duvet cover, fluffy towels, reasonably sized kitchen area.  Breakfast is excellent, although sometimes difficult to get a table.  Pool is good - spa a little hot for most, but stil ok. The only negative... it is located near a fire station, as is other hotels in the area.  So get a high floor if necessary, as was our 11th floor.  It was not that bad.  Valet service is competitive and excellent, but takes about 10 minutes. Overall - this is a terrific value, great services, friendly staff..  Take if from someone who travels frequently.  This hotel was nicer than the Chicago Hilton, without the fancy ceiling.   The Hilton does have one of the cows.   that's what you're paying for.",5
522,"Clean spacious rooms. I managed to snag one of the corner suites on the 5th floor which was gigantic. Got a nice kitchen, dining area, lounge and gigantic bedroom. There gym is pretty nice. Got a lot of cardio equipment, free weights. Would have liked a bit more weight machines but it did the job. Swimming pool is nice. What I really like is that it's connected to Ruth Chris which is awesome. Walking distance to pretty much all the bars and clubs in River North. Staff was friendly and very helpful. Price was extremely reasonable considering that the other hotels in the area were more expensive.",4
523,"Very clean, comfortable spacious rooms. The hotel has a great small gym which I took advantage of and also a pool that looks very nice although I didn't have an opportunity to go swimming. The best part is that breakfast is included with your stay and you can get a hot beverage any time of day. I will definitely stay here again on my next business trip to Chicago.",4
524,"This Hampton Inn was great. The room was clean and comfortable, the free breakfast was good. Outstanding location !! It was a 2 block walk to the Grand red line stop and this made it very convenient for me to get to work each day (and it saved me $18 per day parking at my job site). Tons of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. My fav restaurant was Bandera. The only thing that I didn't like about this property was the $42 per day for valet parking. I think this is on par with other hotels in the downtown area, but that still doesn't make me like it. I parked at the public lot next door to the hotel for $30 per night (another steep price for parking) - this lot doesn't allow in/out. I walked everywhere or caught the train, so next time I probably wouldn't even rent a car. As mentioned in other posts for this hotel, the Fire Station is right next door and I heard the fire trucks every day. They were loud, but luckily they weren't going out frequently. I have to give a shout out to Andrew who was very helpful with getting an AAA room rate assigned to my reservation.",4
525,"I recently threw a Bachelorette party here renting a king suite and a joining double room. The suite was perfect for the preparty doing gifts and things. I had about 16 people there and there was plenty of room. The staff was great, very accomodating. The location was awesome and the hotel offers free wireless AND free breakfast. The breakfast was much more then continential.",4
526,"I'm completely torn on how exactly to rate this hotel. There were a lot of things I liked about it, and I will probably stay here again, but it could use some improvements. The Hampton Inn is truly within walking distance of everything we really needed. We drove from Detroit, parked the truck, and only used it when going outside of downtown. We walked the magnificent mile, we walked to Millenium and Grant Parks, we walked to Navy Pier, I walked to get Kolten's hair cut. It's in a great location! Parking: never cheap doing valet! But for $42/day....We were staying here for 3 1/2 days... and it's just not justifiable in my book. I opted for the privately owned parking lot across the street for $25/day with unlimited in-and-out privileges! Note: cash only! It was impossible to get a smile out of the owner too. Valet/Bell Hops: great during the day! They saw us coming with the stroller and opened all of the doors =) At night, we were pretty much on our own. That's not a true complaint, but it should be more consistent. Breakfast: continental breakfast! The hot foods changed each morning but the rest was still more than enough to fill me up before starting out our day. Fresh fruit [grapefruit, pineapple, and oranges], box cereal, muffins, bagels, juice, coffee.... a definite plus when vacationing! Price: Excellent for the amenities offered!! Remember to book it with the discount [AAA, etc] to ensure the price quoted reflects the discount. They even allowed late check-out without any extra cost since no one had booked our particular room, which allowed us to get in some last minute stops without driving around with all of our goodies. Pool was a great way to get Kolten used to swimming and to wind down in the afternoon. It's not olympic size but there is also a jacuzzi tub and steam room in the pool area on the 2nd floor. Hotel key entry. The room itself: -industrial view. We were not blessed with a city view. More like the alleyway, but that's okay- we wanted to see the city up close and personal..not from the room window. Plus, when we were in the room, the shades were closed to drown out the light, to lull Kolten to sleep. -Major plus for mom's/traveling with young ones: kitchenette. FRIDGE, stove, microwave, dishwasher and sink. Perfect for storing Kolten's gallon of milk, drinks, fruits, string cheese, and all of our water and snacks! I was really relieved when the honey mentioned we would have the kitchenette!! -living room partitioned off with solid french-like doors. The doors needed some serious WD-40! It made the most obnoxious loud screech whenever you tried to open it. It was useless to try to open them quietly without the monster waking up. The teeth clenching and eye squint didn't help either! -Couch, a chair with ottoman in the living room and another identical set in the bedroom, 2 flat screen TVs- one in the living room and one in the bedroom, desk and office chair, kitchenette table and chairs, coffee tables, etc. Keep in mind the furniture isn't ""dingy"" per se, it could use some updating, or maybe a good steam cleaning. The upholstery looked kind of grandma-ish. -The bed- king sized with white linens and breakfast tray. This is where the magic happens...LOL! Surprisingly, this bed didn't give me the hee-bee-gee-bee's like some hotels have in the past with their floral bedspread and nasty blankets. This my friends, is comfy, clean, and crisp. Notes: 1. When up in the morning and getting a slow start, remember to put the ""Resting"" tag on door....or else the housekeeper will get a peek of your goods coming out of the shower! 2. When tilting the 1 1/2 yr old back in the office chair and spinning it around, always check underneath to make sure it has both bolts... or else the back falls off along with the child. Thankfully, he was alright, and the manager on duty came up apologizing and filed an incident report. We also got a replacement chair. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends, if they weren't looking to stay in a penthouse-style hotel.",3
527,"Reasons why I chose the Hampton Inn Downtown in the middle of it all!  Walking distance (its good for the mind, body, and soul)! - 1 minute to Ruth's Steak House - 2 minutes to Rockit - 2 minutes to one of my favorite sports bar:  Mother Hubbards - 5 minute walking distance to Magnificent Mile - 5 minutes to the clubs (Excalibur, Cabaret, Andy's Live Jazz) - 7 minutes to Brazzaz (Brazilian Steakhouse) - 8 minutes to Hooters - 15 minutes to Millennium Park - 15 minutes to Sears Tower - 18 minutes to Bukingham Fountain - 20 minutes to Field Museum - And when I walked... I found all these intriguing hole in the wall places you can't experience when you take the taxi. King Suite - King size bed with tv, breakfast tray, and privacy doors. - Personal bath and closest with a security safe. - Living room to host your local guests. - WI-FI (so I yelp when I get back to the hotel room at 3:00am) - Kitchen with stove, refrigerator, microwave, and small dining table with chairs. Complimentary Breakfast each morning from 6:00am-10:00am - Its not Denny's but its enough to get a big breakfast before I started my tourist day.    Now I do compliment the hospitality of the morning servers...they're friendlier than Denny's. - Okay.. its not that great.   Mostly pre-made meals like waffles, processed eggs, and a juice machine.    But I enjoyed the fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits, and sausage. Service & Hospitality - They got it down.   Smiles at the lobby.    I know I should have told her in person, but ISABELLA ... You're freakin HOT!   Thanks for helping out with my room selection and your smiles at the elevator!   * yes, i can't stop smiling when i think about IT!  * - Firm greetings by the bell service.    Easy to load and unload upon arrival or departure.    They got the great connection for taxi service and local recommends. Other Amenities & Services: - Tiny lap pool (worth visiting if you want to spend time alone and distress). - Fitness center - Skip it!  Way to small to declare it a workout center.   You're better off exploring Chicago on foot. - Luggage Hold:  Thank you Nathan for securing my luggages while I finalized my downtown Chicago visit.    This helps alot when you have a busy schedule. Drawbacks? - It's next to a fire station.   So at night, you might get the sirens depending where your room is at. - I wasn't lucky enough to get a great view of downtown Chicago.   I opened both my windows and saw a great big business building.   Argh! No major complaints here.    More compliments!   I spent about six hours a day at the Hampton Inn.    I didn't need a five start hotel because I really need a place to get some rest, keep my drinks cold, shower and change, internet access, and SPACE!    I really hate staying at crowded hotel rooms.     So this was a perfect palace for me.      Cleanliness and excellent service exists here (we'll that's because this was a King Suite).     So I officially crown Hampton Inn as my official Chicago hotel to stay.   I'll be checking in again soon in Spring 2008.",4
528,"I stayed in Dec for 4 nights and the hotel was great. The standard room is fine with the view of fire dept. It's a few blocks to Miracle Mile, dining, and other attractions.  Traders Joe and Jewel Osco is not that far from the hotel too.  The staff are nice and friendly. I would come back to this hotel. The only improvement is that they need to improve on their free breakfast.",3
529,"Huh? Did all of these people stay at the same hotel I did? I stayed here for 2 miserable nights and  will not be back. The ONLY reason to stay here is that it is close to the redline. I booked a room for some last minute travel right before New Years. Since my stay in Chicago was going to be over the holiday, I wanted to be close to the redline so I could visit friends. This hotel fulfills this need well. The room was clean, but horribly dated. The counter/minibar area was beat to hell. Huge gouges in it, I have no idea what happened. The bathroom was much the same way. The cabinet doors under the sink were hanging off their hinges. Not what I expected staying on the Hilton Honors floor. Putting an LCD tv in an otherwise 30 year old room does not update it. This is all cosmetic, so I didn't care much. And for those of you reading this thinking I simply put down Hamptons, read my other reviews, I tend to stay at Hampton Inns more than any other hotel. This is by far the worst I have ever been to. There was 1 open outlet in the proximity of the bed/desk area. Huh? some of us have to charge our phone and laptop at the same time. Imagine that The ABSOLUTE worst, is the fact it is across the street from one of the busiest firehouses in the city. Nothing better than listening to wailing fire engines all night. I honestly think the guy that was passed out in the elevator when I got back on New Years slept better than I did in my bed. If you are looking for a hotel in the area, look elsewhere, or bring earplugs.",2
530,Location Location Location and very clean. I love being close to it all and this is about as perfect as you can get. The price was great for the suite we had - great place to stay!,4
531,"I stepped in and felt like I had stepped into the 70s. And the floor was so dirty. We took our shoes off, and after about an hour, the bottoms of our feet were all black. So gross. Most importantly, several of my girlfriends came over. We're all professionals in our late 20s-early 30s. We were laughing and giggling but definitely were not screaming or being loud. An extremely rude manager came up and told us that we were being too loud, he could hear us downstairs, and that there had been 2 complaints. If there was a 3rd complaint, we would have to leave the hotel, which we should have done anyway. First of all, 2 of our friends were resting in the bedroom because they had headaches and barely heard us. We were on the 5th floor. So if they could hear us in the lobby, the construction must be outrageously poor. 5 minutes later, they sent a cop up, who was actually very pleasant. But really, a cop? By then, we were just sitting around, trying to figure out where to go. Not being loud at all. Go spend your money somewhere else. There are plenty of better and cleaner hotels...with more pleasant managers. The only pleasant people we encountered at the hotel were the valets. They were the only ones to get a nice tip.",1
532,"The least pleasant aspect of the hotel was trying to relax in the whirlpool tub while there were young children in it. The rules sign says children under 14 are not permitted but both times we tried to visit it there were children. The first time a mom brought 4 young children in who were splashing around and knocking into me and my boyfriend. I mentioned to her that children weren't allowed but she didn't do anything. I told the front desk as we were leaving that day. The next time I noticed it before we got in, so I called from a hotel phone to the front desk to let them know. They said they would take care of it, but I did not see a hotel representative during the next hour or so we were there, and again, children were in the whirlpool. I feel that the staff of the hotel should regularly monitor and enforce this rule, since the parents seem unwilling to follow it on their own. We tend to really enjoy the pool/hottub at hotels we visit, so I'm not sure I'd come here again... The free breakfast was a little similar but reasonably good each day, especially the make-your-own fresh waffles. Wifi worked well, staff was friendly and responsive (except for the whirlpool issue). When it was raining they let us borrow a couple of umbrellas. Only a block from the Grand stop on the red line.",2
533,"I live in a box in East Lakeview....(who doesn't?!), so, when I found out a bunch of my friends were coming into the city for my birthday, there was no way we'd all fit at my place. I booked a room at the Hampton because I'm a point fanatic for all Hilton properties.  Plus, it was right around the corner from Rockit, which is where I wanted to have dinner.  How convenient!  It's a good location, overall, for people visiting the city. The parking here is like $40 for 24 hours.  Not too bad for RIver North, I suppose.  There's adjacent lots for cheaper, but I'm not sure how secure those lots are for overnight parking.  Staff here is super friendly.  Like, whoa.  I didn't know the service at a Hampton could be so awesome. I got a rate of $189 online.  That's a pretty great price considering you get two rooms, two tv's, a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, and pull out couch.  It's way spacious, good for pregaming, and I think they give you free popcorn.  Rooms are clean, bathrooms are small, but functional. Hampton's also offer free breakfast, which are handy in attempting to cure your morning after hangover.  If you're lucky, you'll be there when they serve up my personal fav - waffles.",4
534,"It was long pending from my side to review Hampton but somehow it slipped out of my mind. So here it goes.. I stayed here almost an year back for 20 days. -Location: Hampton is located in the heart of downtown. It's just a block away from red line station. It's very near to all the good restaurants and Chicago River Walk.Clubs like Excalibur, Andy's live jazz and restuarants like Shaw Crab house,Braazars,Benny's Steak House are very close. -Room: My room was quite big with all the facilities like a small fridge, microwave,coffee machine,ironing board, iron and flat screen.Bed was very big and comfortable.It had a couch and small table.The room had a very good Wi-Fi connection.Closet with security safe. The bathroom had all the basic amenities and was very clean. -Staff: Staff is very helpful right from the doorman, receptionist and manager. They go all the way to help you out whether it's getting a cab or getting tickets for the local cubs game. -Hotel: It had a business centre which has Internet,printer and fax facility. The pool and jacuzzi area is clean enough to be used.Gym is very basic,they should add some more equimenmts. -Food: The complimentary breakfast was very good.It consisted of waffles,coffee,cakes,eggs,juice machine,fresh fruit, buttermilk biscuits,sausage and different variety of cereals. The bad part is if you are staying too long in the Hotel like I did, one does get bored with the same breakfast daily. I did request them to change their menu.Will have to stay again at Hampton to check if they changed it or not. -Drawbacks: It's very near to fire station so there is a constant disturbance due to fire alarm voice. Even when the windows are closed the sound is quite prominent inside the room.",4
535,"Nice location, decent room for the price.  We were in town to see a show at House of Blues, down Dearborn a couple blocks.  We were able to walk everywhere we planned to go with at most a 15 minute walk.  We did some shopping at Water Tower Mall, hit a few of the bars on Hubbard, wandered to Pizzaria Uno for late dinner Friday.  We were going to take a cab up to Rush St bars on Saturday, but were wiped out from the House of Blues show we went to,.   The free breakfast was decent.  We had a mini suite, 2 beds in one room, a living/dining room with sofa and armchair, tvs in living room and bedroom.  The full sized fridge was handy for leftovers and to keep the booze we brought with us cold.  Had we known we'd have a stove-top, we might have brought other stuff along.   Valet suggested we could self-park across the street for $25/night instead of their $42/night, and had in/out privileges.",4
536,"I like hampton inn, more like a big hotel with small hotel service. bed and room are nice. get a higher floor, because chicago is notorious for their ambulance. free breakfast, free internet. close to shopping.",4
537,"Loved my stay here! My room was spacious, modern and very clean. The little kitchenette definitely came in handy for saving dinner leftovers fmand having them for lunch. Hey, I'm cheap like that! Speaking of cheap, this hotel is an unbelievably great price. Granted I stayed in the middle of bitter Chicago winter, it was only 80 per room. Also, the location was super convenient with all the major downtown points only a few blocks away. I'm a pleasantly surprised fan.",5
538,"You've probably  stayed in hotels of this type: clean but absolutely no frills.  Bathroom not glamorous  (dayem I love those high-end hotel bathrooms) and my suite was slightly run-down (but clean) but here's the thing: the people who work here rock.   Helpful and accommodating...down to every last interaction.  Impeccable.  Forget about redecorating, Hampton Inn.  Take that money and give your awesome staff a big fat raise.  They totally deserve it.",4
539,"Great location!  It's close to L stops, great restaurants, and cool bars.  Very nice room and facilities.  Having free WiFi is a big plus.  They also have a great breakfast buffet!  Would definitely stay again.",4

541,"This is a step up from the typical suburban Hampton Inn, as it features Prairie Style interiors in a nod to the Midwest location. The lobby is nice, the rooms are pleasant, and so is the free continental breakfast buffet. The feature restaurant on the main floor seemingly changes yearly, but the hotel itself is fine.",4
542,"Wonderful location, a few blocks from Michigan Ave and 1 block from the Red Line El. The king studio was clean, spacious and had a mini fridge and bar sink. Décor seems old-style but not old. Definitely would stay here again, since the value was great ($143.10 - $224.10) and the location was good. Why spend $300+ on a room that you'll never be in!?!",4
543,"The hotel is very nice based on my stays at other Hamptons.  The location is super convenient to major downtown businesses and attractions.  Don't stay in a room near the elevator.  You will hear noise from the hallway and elevators.  The rooms have modern furniture and televisions but if noise is an issue, you may want to stay elsewhere.",3

545,"My (new to me) SUV, 2008 Iron Man Explorer now has a crappy crack and the cover of my hitch is pulled away from the bumper. I'm disappointed, the response from management was to be expected - they will not be responsible. I drove away this morning since I left at 6.30am, and just looked at it when I arrived home in Michigan. I absolutely know that my vehicle was only parked in the garage at the Hampton Inn during my stay. The rest of my visit, someone was in the truck at all times. Right before I left home to visit Chicago, I worked with the hitch for the trailer I am about to purchase to ensure I saw how everything should be connected. At that time, (two days earlier) there were no scratches, no cracks and the bumper was flush with the hitch cover. I paid $42 per day for parking and the care of my vehicle was crap. Do not park at this hotel. Additionally, my room was noisy (I heard every conversation down the hall at all times) although the hotel staff was mostly pleasant. Altogether this was an extremely disappointing visit.  Park across the street if you stay here.  I lived in Chi Town for 2 years so I'm used to the fire engines/ambulances everywhere but cannot stomach the horrible care of my vehicle.",1
546,"Ian!! Congrats you did it again. Total home run, great space, great ambiance and total class act. From the bar to the pump room to the overall atmosphere...favorite new hotel--period. Couple of observations: reminds me of the Gramercy but in white and a little more homey.... . The rooms while awesome (caveat---I was in a suite), do have some of the original features of the Ambassador so the bathrooms are a tad small and there are a few other quirky nuisances.  But a small price to pay for a bad ass experience.",5
547,"** Updated Review ** I wrote a previous review on Trip Advisor about an item of mine that went missing at my stay at Public Hotel. Since then, the hotel has followed up and I thought it was only fair to update my review as well. Mary Beth was kind enough to call me the following day to apologize and make sure that my item was promptly replaced. It was a hugely generous offer and even though it was an unfortunate incident, I'm happy to say that the customer service at least, gets my vote of confidence.",3
548,"We were part of a wedding block.  Let's put it this way, I wouldn't pay full-freight for this place. Pros: 1. Great service.  Guest services responded promptly to all requests. 2. Free Wifi.  I wish every hotel had this. 3. Drinks in the bar were good and we had some small plates which weren't bad. Cons: 1. Place needs like two more elevators.  At least. 2. Walls are paper thin. 3. Everything in the room is a bit ""off"".  One of the lights in the bathroom (not a lot of light to begin with) went out.  Twice.  The bathroom door kept sticking.  They gutted this building and they couldn't replace the bathroom door knobs/hinges? 4. Also (and this may sound strange), but they include a body lotion tube but not a shower gel?  I feel like shower gels are the norm these days so I was surprised to see a bar of soap in the shower. 5. Did I mention they need more elevators? Just an FYI, as noted in the other reviews, the whole lobby basically turns into a club at night on Friday/Saturday.",3

551,Recently traveled to Chicago and decided to stay at this hotel opposed to the Fairmont which is my usual choice. The hotel is recently remodeled and looks wonderful.  The rooms are average size and tastefully decorated.  The hotel staff was prompt and responsive to all my needs. This hotel is located in a great little neighborhood and there were many places within walking distance. I love the restaurant and the food was excellent.  This hotel will definitely be at the top of my list of choices for my next visit to Chicago.,4
552,"3.5 stars for this hotel. I'm rounding to 3. Let me start off by saying I am in love with decor in the lobby and surrounding areas. The all white gives a very clean appearance and looks fantastic with the black accents. If it weren't for that, I'd give the hotel 3 stars. Our hotel room mirrored that, but was a lot more basic (and I mean-A LOT). The bed was comfortable and we had no problems with the TV or air. Our bathtub would not drain which was no good but other than that, very satisfied with our stay.",3
553,"Honestly, public has always been my favorite hotel in Chicago area, I stayed at this place couple times. But this time, I have to give them 1 star, and if I could, I would give them a 0. And I will never stay there again. Here is my story: Me and my boyfriend stayed at public on Tuesday and we checked out on Wednesday and went back to Indiana. When I was home, I found I left my jacket in the room. And we called the hotel, they said nothing was found in my room. But my boyfriend and I both clearly remember we left the jacket on the hanger in the closet! We are pretty sure about this. I was so sad because this is a rare find Chanel jacket which I just purchased in Miami two weeks again and hasn't worn once! And it still has price tag in it, which says 5000 dollars! I don't want to assume the housekeeping people stolen my jacket, but there's no other way I can think of it! And we drove four hours to Chicago that night just want to make sure if we can find back my coat, but the front desk people said they never found it. I guess I just lost it forever. I was so disappointed about that, and this is the worst hotel experience in my whole life. I don't think a decent hotel should expect this kind of things happen. So if you want to stay at this place. Make sure you take care of your belongings. Otherwise, it is gonna disappear forever!",1
554,"I'm just wrapping up a two night stay at Public and I can't say enough great things about this hotel - however I'll try to sum it up below. The Pros: - Amazing Staff. Everyone from the doormen, to the people at the front desk, to the folks delivery room service. They are super nice and super helpful. - The decor is beautiful. I would love for my house to look like this. It modern, tasteful, and looks like something you'd see in the most upscale NY Hotel. - The beds are super comfortable. - The water pressure in the shower is excellent. (Nothing is worse than discovering a hotel with low flow shower heads!) - The happy hour and night life is great. (And this was on a Tue and Wed - The weekends are probably even better.) - You can walk to lots of great restaurants and shopping. - They have bikes that you can borrow - FOR FREE! - Wifi is free and easy to access. The Cons: - None, Zero, Zilch I will definitely be coming back to this hotel.",5
555,"Beautiful hotel with fantastic rooms. However, the TV didn't work the entire three days we were there. Air conditioning was also very flakey (coming in and out for no reason) on the hottest weekend of the year. The morning of check-out, two separate people came to the room before 10 am to ask what time we would be checking out (not to mention the maid coming twice to see if we were out of the room). After telling the two different people that we would be out of the room by 1pm, the manager then called *again to make sure we would be checking out. After paying full price for two nights at the hotel, plus drinks at the bar, plus dinner at the restaurant, we thought we'd earned the right to enjoy our last few hours in the room. Instead, we felt hurried out. When I expressed this to Emilia, the director of the front office, she responded that she was sorry, and had expressed our frustration with her colleagues. No offer for a discount on future stays with them, or even to take the $15 minibar charge off our bill. In a city with a lot of other hotel options, you'd think they'd take every opportunity to build customer loyalty. They definitely fell short, here.",1
556,"I REALLY wanted to write a bad review for this place. Why? Because I would love to go back. Confused? Let me explain. The staff at PUBLIC cares a lot about their guests. It shows in everything they do from check in to check out. One example of this care can be seen while scouring other yelp reviews. They have a staff member who replies to negative reviews and offers to be contacted to talk it over and, I only assume, offer something in the way of compensation with a free stay. This is business 101--please the people who have not been pleased--but is something you rarely see anymore these days. So I was really hoping to have bad things to say in this review so that I could receive such contact and get to go back to PUBLIC for another night. Sadly, my experience was superb all the way through. I booked hotel PUBLIC with my Visa Signature, since it's part of their Signature Luxury Hotel Collection. This was a great idea if you're able, because it means a 2 night stay will come with $100 food/drink credit, complimentary valet parking, breakfast and a late check-out. This will help you go even further in enjoying what PUBLIC has available. Their restaurant, The Pumproom, is a slight revamp of the Chicago classic. Photos in the lower level show the hundreds of powerful people from Chicago's history who would sit down there at ""booth 1"" where they could take calls at the resident phone. Prices were hi, as expected, but food was superb in flavor and presentation and they threw in a couple shotglass sized samples of their gazpacho soup, which was a highlight. They also have ""the library,"" which sports a changing coffee shop/bar, depending on the time of day you make it there. We brought a friend with us to enjoy cocktails there on our second evening and everyone was very pleased. Everyone working there is very kind and seems very sincere. They are able to work in what is obviously a high class environment without being snobby or snooty. Swell folks. The room was comfortable, nice lighting options, great water pressure, considerate housekeeping (even plugged my laptop in for me when they were in there). I hope to go back some day on my own dime, because the PUBLIC hotel is totally worth it.",5
557,"White, White, White!! Love the decor Great staff Great night life in this hotel Good size rooms I agree... The water pressure is excellent. Everything is white and clean You get what you paid for :) However, we had an issue with the air conditioning... But, we just turn it off  and on and done! TV didn't work properly. Will stay here again.",4
558,"Nice swank hotel especially if you can get at a discount. I came to Chicago for one night and got a great deal on Public from Jetsetter.  Located in the middle of everything, within walking distance to Rush Street, shopping, bars, restaurants, and many good things in Chicago.  Cool lobby bar with great drink options in a pimp setting.   The room itself is nice - spacious, decent view, comfy bed albeit on the floor.  It's an older building that was upgraded to make this hotel, but with a nice staff, sexy young bar in the lobby and good enough rooms this does the job quite well.  Plus a quick walk and you're in the heart of good Chicago.",4
559,"There was this big event during the weekend of my stay so the place was packed. The staff was friendly and nice. The restaurant downstairs had great food and divine desserts, and very good coffee.  There was a bar that was quite full the whole period of my stay and a decent selection of wine. I love the room decor and I had a nice view out my window as well. The bathroom was teeny tiny but it was adequate for one person. The room itself was spacious enough and uncluttered, just the way I like it. I think the location is wonderful, the general area was pretty safe. I'd say that the main negative for me was the noise level from outside the room during the day (while cleaning? not sure) but it was fairly quiet at night.",4
560,"The Public is by all accounts an Ian Schrager hotel.  Which is lovely....if you enjoy your bed on the floor and your  bathroom miniscule.  I don't.  So I'm not the perfect Schrager-stayer so to speak. The bed feels like a futon, but the sheets were nice and soft.  Decent TV and an ipod dock.  NO ALARM CLOCK.  Which is annoying.  I want an alarm clock in my room please.  Desk was not very user friendly and definitely not comfortable.  Bathroom was teenie tiny and I ran out of hot water the first day at 7:30am.  Apparently they had water heater issues that day, but they failed to let us know. On the plus side the little coffee bar is fabulous.  Very good lattes.  And the bar is cool and hip and has decent wine.   Overall, I like a little more comfort when I stay away from home.  So I can't say that I loved the Public.",2
561,"Public is a stunning hotel in the best neighborhood in Chicago. The decor is to die for. The hotel was previously The Ambassador hotel and it's face lift to Public was well worth the effort. I stayed over the weekend and received excellent customer service. There are many spaces in the hotel to sit and relax with food, cocktails or coffee, each space more fabulous than the last. On the weekends the place was packed with people going to the restaurant and bars, definitely a see and be seen kind of place. I can't wait to come back and stay again.",5
562,"We stayed in one of the suites for my friends' weddings so that they could have someplace for people to hang out if there wasn't room elsewhere.  The room was nice enough.  The staff was awkward and aloof, maybe a little bit rude, but maybe they were just having a bad moment....The air conditioning was really loud.  There were cords all over the place because the hotel is old and rather than *actually* renovate the hotel, they painted it white.  I rarely interacted with any hotel staff.... Except for the valet attendants... and that is where things got really bad for us.  We parked our car there both at an hourly rate and overnight over the two days that we stayed there (the first night I drove home to the suburbs to be with our baby)s....  I paid for the valet, tipped the attendants who had parked my car waaaay off to the side (of course!) and got home after our stay to find that my brand new car was damaged noticeably in two places--the fender and the bumper.  Mind you, this isn't the 'I didn't notice' kind of damage.  Rather, someone tapped (rather hard) against a wall or another car, and another car skinned my car's rear bumper.  And so begins my conversion from lukewarm guest to horribly dissatisfied guest.   The hotel gave me the number of the valet company and told me not to call that day because the owner, with whom I would need to speak, would be out of the office.  I called the next morning and spoke with Kathy from GP parking who said she would call me back.  Three days later, still no return call, I call Kathy, ask to speak to Tom, the owner, she says that she is actually the person I should talk to and 'why did I wait so long to say anything--and why didn't I say something when I picked the car up from the attendants--and not to say that you would, but you could have had an incident on the way home that caused this damage but you want to blame it on us so that we pay for it.....'  She continued like that, accusing me of lying and being overall incredibly rude, disinterested and insulting about the whole thing.   So I called the hotel.  The ladies at the hotel (first Emelia, then MaryBeth) were nice as pie to me and supposedly did get in touch with their valet company.  By their accounts the valet company conducted a thorough (impartial????) investigation and will not take any responsibility for my vehicle's damage.   I am, absolutely, without a doubt, 100% certain that they did, in fact, damage my car.  And I PAID THEM TO DO IT!  I EVEN TIPPED THEM!!!!!   My friends' Most Expensive Wedding I Ever Paid For As An Attendee/Maid of Honor continues to suck my wallet dry.  The damage most certainly exceeds the cost of my hotel room (and I mentioned we stayed in a suite, right?).  Of course, Public Chicago is not responsible because the hotel hired the horribly rude folk from GP parking to do their valet for them, but they do charge for the valet directly through the hotel.  They didn't even, as a simple gesture, offer to refund the valet fee.  Or any portion of my hotel stay.  Or agree to fire their valet service, which frankly would have been a slightly satisfactory response.....  If they had just told me then and there that they had damaged my car, I would have been okay with it--and I really would have appreciated their honesty.  But they didn't have the decency to do so, and now I hemorrhage more money.  And, did I mention, I absolutely DETEST the institution they call the Public Hotel Chicago????  I do.  I am horribly dissappointed and insulted by the way I was treated.",1
563,"I love staying in new ""concept"" hotels so when Public opened last year, I wanted to check it out. We stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it but it didn't make as big as an impression on us like the Conrad and Palomar did. This is the former Ambassador hotel and Public plays with a lot of the Ambassador style.  This was not a total renovation. Public simply added a few modern touches. Rooms are minimal in style but effective and comfortable. Our room had a very narrow entryway in which a room service tray could barely fit through.  Doors on the closet and bathroom are the originals left over from the Ambassador so they are old and don't close very well.  I love the placement of quirky photos around the room. My biggest complaint with the rooms would have to be the fairly thin walls. If the person in the next room talks slightly above a normal speaking voice be prepared to hear everything. Bathroom was small but had nice clean lines. The bathtub walls were really high for some reason. We ordered their room service, Public Express, for dinner and breakfast. While the dinner was exceptional, breakfast was just okay. Better than Burger King but I've had better at other hotels. The rest of the hotel looks great and the lobby and restaurant are packed on the weekends. Fitness center is very well equipped. But as other people have noted on here, the hallways and especially the elevators are too dark. You can't see which button to push to get to your floor.  Location is nice since it's close to Michigan Avenue but not directly on the busy street.  All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. So why don't I love it? Like I said, Hotel Palomar and the Conrad ""wow"" me with their style and service. I think Public is going more for an ""understated"" vibe which is good. I guess I like my automatic upgrades for being a Hilton Diamond member @ Conrad. Or I look forward to my wine hour and zebra print robes @ Palomar. It's a hotel. I kind of prefer ""fancy"" not ""understated"".",4
564,"The aesthetics at PUBLIC are great, but I don't think enough (or anything at all) was done to upgrade the infrastructure of the aging building. The under-window air conditioner/heater was noisy: the fan rattled and the compressor made a distinct rumble that carried through the floor to my head on the pillow. It wasn't bad enough that I think it was broken; I think it was just poorly made. The bed and linens were fantastic, and I slept soundly after I turned off the heater. (Luckily the room remained a comfortable temperature anyway.) I was awoken in the morning, though, by a loud sound that I first thought was static from the TV or iPod dock. It turned out to be just the water rushing through the pipes as my neighbor took a shower. My own shower was just above lukewarm, even with the faucet open to full hot. The walls and floors must be pretty thin, as I heard plenty of coughing and footsteps from above and next door. I would normally cover these sounds with the steady white noise of the fan, but the rattly fan was worse in this case. I loved the design of the place, but the fact that they didn't do more to mitigate the age of the building and the resulting flaws would probably keep me from coming back.",3
565,"I walked through the front door of Public (which is actually on Goethe, not on State) and immediately felt like I was in the middle of someone else's wedding or charity ball.  The entire main floor was hopping with hundreds of well-dressed people socializing, drinking and lounging.  Normally, this type of scene at a hotel is represented by a demographic in their mid to late 20s.  Not at Public.  Here, the social club is comprised of many people who are 40+, but still have it going on.  This is clearly the ""it"" place to see and be seen by the non-clubbing club. I checked in at the front desk and the service was very friendly and polite.  The elevator took me to my room where I spent a couple of minutes looking for the card reader slot.  I then realized that there is no slot, you simply have to flash your card in front of the plate on your door and it opens.  That's pretty cool.   Once inside the room, I took a quick look around and was immediately reminded of hotel stays I've had in other locations.  I saw flashes of the Mondrian (Los Angeles) with all the white on white on white hues.  There were hints of The W hotel chain with all the modernistic furniture and black & white photo/art accents.  As many people have said, the aesthetics of this hotel are incredibly appealing, mixing classic old school charm with very contemporary flair. As for the functionality of the rooms, we were less impressed.  We quickly learned that beauty doesn't necessarily mean as much when you realize that the shower is so narrow you can hardly turn around inside of it.  Once you get out of the shower, there are no robes, either.  The bathrooms also have no exhaust fans (or as some refer to them ""privacy fans"").   I needed to iron a shirt and pulled the ironing board out of the closet with the iron.  I then spent the next 7 minutes trying to figure out where to plug-in the iron in a space large enough to accommodate the ironing board.  The places where outlets existed did not afford enough space for the board.  I ended up pulling the ironing board into the bathroom and pressing my shirt next to the toilet.  Yes.  I did this. At one point, my wife and I decided to check out the Library bar next to the lobby.  This is a beautiful lounge with comfy furniture, a blazing fireplace and pretty people everywhere.  The waitresses were all wearing these super skin-tight black dresses with one bright silver zipper down their backs.  While they all looked sexy as hell, I began to feel sorry for them the longer I watched them having to lean in and bend over repeatedly in those very tight and slightly revealing uniforms.   Need ice?  You're in luck if you happen to be on the 8th or 17th floors.  Otherwise, you're getting dressed and going for an elevator ride like I had to do. Granted, it was the middle of January and very dry, but our room was incredibly full of static.  Everything we touched gave us a shock, including our bed linens.  We resorted to turning on the shower in an effort to steam out the static at one point. Later, we realized that because our room was on the 3rd floor and immediately above the main entrance, it gets quite loud.  As cabs pull in and out of the valet and drunken hordes of partygoers are coming and going at all hours of the night  several honking horns and ""whoohoo"" noises easily came into our room after we had fallen asleep.   We decided to order the room service breakfast the next morning and it was delivered quickly in nice brown bags with the Public's branding all over them.  Unfortunately, the delivery guy didn't bring us a slip to sign, so I couldn't add a tip for him.  I was forced to pull out a $20 bill and ask him for change...of course, he only had $7 on him, so he got a 50% tip on delivery.   Don't get me wrong.  This is a very nice hotel worthy of many accolades.  Service is top notch.  They spared no expense making everything beautiful to the eye.  However,  we experienced a few minor inconveniences in our stay that were worth noting here.  I think we'd definitely consider staying here again sometime, especially considering the great rate we received $125/night to be in the Gold Coast and Old Town.",3
566,"Customer service here was exceptional! From the moment we got out the cab, everyone was on their toes ensuring that our stay was comfy and stress free. The white plain but modern rooms were trendy and unique. Although it was close to nothing but white, the furniture around the room made the difference. The bed was so soft and comfy that I didn't want to get up - also because it was 12 degrees outside haha. This hotel looks like it aims for the 25+ young professional crowd, it reminds me of the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas. This is like a mini version in the Windy City and without the casino and bright lights. Love it!",5
567,"I love this hotel!  I'm here for business and found a great deal on their webpage.  It's really nice, without being too fancy.  My room is pretty big and free wi-fi is nice.  The lobby has a really fun vibe and the staff are all really nice, and really helpful - even over the phone; is so refreshing.  For the price, this place is way more fun and easy going then some of the other business hotels in the same price range.  I feel like I'm on vacation, I'm so happy I stumbled upon the PUBLIC Chicago.",5
568,"The Schrager crowd all grown up!  happy to see a more cosmopolitan crowd and less dancing twenty-somethings in the lobby and  hallways upstairs.   Room service from The Pump Room by Jean-Georges is the best room service one can hope for from a hotel. All in all it was a pleasant experience, I enjoyed the residential location as well as the decor and the fact that there is a Jean-Georges outpost on site. Somewhere the tag line ""At PUBLIC, service matters most."" doesn't quite translate successfully.  The staff, although attentive, is not quite there in terms of anticipating a guest's needs.  A birthday cake was delivered without silverware or plates to eat it with.  A quick call to the front desk solved the problem in less than 10 minutes.   I requested said cake too late in the afternoon the day before my arrival so the hotel was not able to accommodate my request.  The concierge was at a loss as well.  I had to suggest to her to see if there were any bakeries near by which could come thru.  I was able to arrange for the cake from 35,000 feet in the air.  I would think that a good concierge would have been able to manage it from less than  1/2 mile away. If the hotel were not to bill itself as a new breed focused on service then I would have given them all 5 stars.  But when they are so focused on selling themselves as a service institution and then come short, I simply cannot be an 100% fan.",3
569,"I really wanted to like this hotel-great location, cool-hip vibe (love Ian Schrager), earnest staff (meaning they TRY), and great rates.  However, number of problems.  First, it's VERY loud-as in very little soundproofing.  Second, you can't order a meal at the bar.  Well, technically you can, but it's a ridiculously limited menu.  When I'm traveling on business by myself, I do NOT want to sit in the dining room and I like the convenience of eating at the hotel if I'm particularly busy.  And it's too bad-I would have easily eaten there every night of my four night stay (as I have been known to do at times) if the food was good, but I never got a chance to try it.  Third, they charge you 18% service for oatmeal to go in their cafe (really???).  Fourth, room service comes in ""to-go"".  That's fine, but don't charge me 18% service for that-at least put it on china.  Or just tell me to go downstairs and pick it up.  Oh yeah, they charge you 18% there too.  I agree with some of the other comments, the staff here is really nice.  But some of the management policies are silly.  And not sure I could overcome the noise issue.  Probably will not stay here again.",3
570,"Public was recommended to me by a couple of friends who recently moved from Chicago.  I was intrigued by the idea of a new Ian Schrager hotel.  They made a great suggestion. Travel Date:  July 2-8, 2012 We were greeted at our car by an eager bellboy.  He quickly packed the luggage cart with the aid of our Echo Limousine driver (recommended).  The common spaces are lovely and well appointed.  At check-in my partner and I were promptly assisted.  The desk clerk noticed I had booked a smokin' hot special online for a regular queen room.  When she saw the height of my partner, 6'3"", she said, ""let's see if we can find something a little bigger.""  She upgraded our room, at no additional cost, to a corner King Deluxe.  We had three large windows, a full walk-in closet and plenty of room for our week long stay.   The building is two blocks from the Lake and in a beautiful Near North neighborhood.  Just a few blocks south is the Rush St and Division St scene.  Good nightlife, restaurants, music and cocktails.  A taxi was always waiting and if you prefer public transportation the Red Line has a station at State/Division.  If you like car service, UBER has fantastic coverage in the downtown area and is never more than a couple of minutes from Public. Pump Room provided a fantastic Fourth of July Dinner for 11 guests at a moment's notice.  They even comped a selection of flatbreads.   Our stay was not without hiccups...  We experienced Chicago's hottest July Fourth in over 100 years.  This caused the satellite receivers to overheat and we lost TV reception for two partial days and one full day.  Upon inquiring about the loss of signal, several options were provided, free movie tickets, free bike rentals or assistance booking other entertainment, spa services & tours.  Our shower head had a leak that sprayed water backwards directly on the wall and ceiling.  It didn't bother me but I figured I'd let them know to avoid future damage to the walls.  They sent a repairman after we left the room for the day and when we returned we had a voice-mail from guest services notifying us of the repair and apologizing for the (nonexistent) inconvenience.   Everyone we encountered was fantastic; great service in Pump Room, fantastic mixologists in both bars, quick room service and helpful guest relations.   The only thing missing is a day spa, of course I knew this when I booked the room.  They partner with a place just down the street but I feel that a Hotel of this caliber should have an in-house facility. I will gladly stay here again.",5
571,"PUBLIC hotel is  Ian Shregers project of transformation and new beginnings but is it all its cracked up to be? Or is it just a mirage in the shariah desert?   I booked PUBLIC hotel on http://bookaroom.com, loving the price and wanting to try something new besides the occasional Hyatt or Hilton. Being from Ohio and having lived in Los Angeles, I wanted something that was moderately priced, but had a trendy flair. As far as appeal, PUBLIC exceeded my expectations. I liked being greeted by men wearing trench coats and chuck Taylor's and being waited on by beautiful people in a Tom Ford add ( remember I did live in LA), however I felt a ltittle betrayed and left with slight bad taste in my mouth. Everything was great the free wifi throughout the hotel, the clean modern gym, the nice hospitality, but when I payed for the hotel two weeks ago, I thought that was only charge I was going to receive. They didn't mention that there was a 150 dollar holding fee and being that it was a debit card the funds were withheld. You can imagine how I felt when I found out that the card I was swiping for shopping and eating was running empty. When I approached the hotel they were very apologetic and handled the situation very timely. I understand there was a lack of communication and telling people that their is a holding fee is something that is not top of their list. I am really not here to beat down on PUBLIC hotel, throw a few punches yes. I just wanted to warn people of this fee because if this happens again and you caught say a  ""New Yorker"" on a bad day, the hotel will not hear the end of it.",3
572,"This Ian Schrager retooling of an iconic Chicago hotel seamlessly melds classic architectural details with modern style and service. The hotel hasn't been open for long, and the quality of service is where this fact is most obvious. The staff are all improbably attractive, and tremendously green. I'm sure that they'll get better, but the generally inexperienced staff -- front desk, valets, coffee bar, bar -- are what cost this hotel a star in my review. Probably would have cost them two stars had they not all been so good-looking! I'd definitely stay there again!",4
573,"Worlds collide.  Old dog, new tricks.  In a nutshell, well done Ian Schrager, well done sir! I have always been a fan of the Ian Schrager Hotel group and I was thrilled to hear that they were opening in a grand old dame of properties, the former Ambassador East.   I wasn't quite sure how a finger on the pulse, New York second kind of guy would treat the aging beauty but I was dumbfounded by the gentle transititon that holds true the elegance of the days of grandiose with slick and contemporary style. Gratefful a dear friend was touring with an old school rocker that was housed in this gem and got to take a mini staycation while hanging out with rockstars.   So yes, the Pump Room was not my Grandma's cocktail salon and Kup and Harry Caray were just hovering from the heavens above but it was a definitely a hot crowd full of ""all the young dudes"" and lots of smoking hot beauties holding court.   Staff was fantastic as is expected from the Rockit Ranch crew and service was fast and furious. Rooms were spacious for a Schrager property says the girl who has spend extended stays at Paramount, Royalton and Morgans in my day.   Like double the size.  Ikea like in nature but sleek and comfy none the less.  Exquisite linens and lux robes and towels were my saving grace.   I will note I mistook a mirror for a door at one point and may or may not have lifted it off the wall but we'll leave that for later.   Staycation was amazing....... Public rooms are exquisite with soft yet sleek design elements, engaging staff and absolutely gorgeous finishes.   Clean, chic, sophisticated cool.  Worlds collide.  In a nutshell: old dog did new tricks quite well.",5
574,"The wife and I stayed here for a night as a reward for not going insane after being cooped up with our newborn for three months.  Yes, probably a Holiday Inn would have been quite fine at that point, but i tend to believe i am a good judge of things, and the Public Hotel deserves my accolades.   The staff were incredibly friendly to start.  The lobby was beautiful, with lots of places to relax if you needed a break, but didn't want to be in your hotel room.   The hotel room, which was reasonably priced compared to some other local hotels, was really cool and modern.  They did a nice job with the old bathrooms, without having to completely redo them.  The bed was cozy, and the bath products were top notch.  There was a nice flat screen with an easy to use operating system.  My only complaint on the room was that there was a gap between the door bottom and the floor, and when our neighbors returned to their room at 5AM (must have been a good night), we heard their whole conversation through their and our closed doors.  I opened the door and knocked on theirs and asked them to keep it down. We ate at the restaurant that evening, and the food was excellent.  I had the Pork Tenderloin and my wife had their Weiner Schnitzel.  The Schnitzel was outstanding.  They also had a good wine list, however later i found out the glass of $12 Chardonnay i was drinking retailed for $10.99 a bottle.  That is some mark up. After dinner we had another drink in the lobby which turned into a total 40 to 60 year old meat market.  We went to sleep early, but i hear the crowd gets younger as thee night goes on.  It was good people watching anyway. Brunch in the morning wasn't bad, but next time i will meander over to the Original House of Pancakes off Rush street. We also loved the location of the hotel.  It was in a quieter area, but only minutes from the action by foot or by cab.   We would definitely stay here again.",4
575,"This hotel is a lot of fun. The design is great, as is the vibe. As you walk in, it feels opulent, some of the neo-classical and art-deco architectural elements are smoothed out with a soothing neutral palette. Service is excellent, both at reception, in the coffee bar and throughout the hotel. The lobby after 5:00p.m. can feel like party central, as it seems to be a hip after-work hang out spot - which didn't bother me, but it is a bit loud in the lobby in the evening. None of this noise affected me once I was off of that floor, however. The coffee bar is wonderful, too! The coffee is well-priced, and while it is a bit watery, this is standard across the United States. In a city that is known for its coffee roasters and coffee shops, however, definitely check out other places! Nonetheless, the decor is great at the coffee bar and the pastries they offer are not bad. The room was very comfortable - very visually soothing and a great place to unravel from my jam-packed days!",4
576,"Wow. If zero stars was an option thats what I would have.  I really cant say one good thing about this place except that their food is ok.  If you're looking for a hotel and not just a good restaurant do not stay here.  Being from New York and knowing what Ian Schrager is capable of is clearly not a good thing.  Our expectations were high and this place didnt even come close. The 24 year old staff was completely unhelpful.  In all honestly, you could get a better bathroom at a Holiday Inn.  There are a lot of great hotels in Chicago, don't let a reputation like Schragers lead you away from them.  This hotel was a waste, felt unfinished and was an overall lazy effort.",1
577,"I stayed here recently for a business trip.  Before its OFFICAL opening, I got a great deal on a room.  I was never a devotee of the old Ambassador East Hotel, so I can't speak to the comparison.  What I do know is that I LOVE this hotel.  It works for me as I am a minimalist, modernist and I dig clean, spare spaces. I booked on price line and got a very good deal, but when I showed up, they upgraded me to a one room suite on the 16th floor...which had the MOST amazing view of both the towers and a little picnic table and a cupboard for the dining implementry in a completely different room. The living room was done all in white and was gorgeously appointed.  The bed was a king size, low to the ground and extremely comfortable.  Very Asian in feeling, but Swedish in style. Bathroom was a little bit small, but well turned out.  There were two large flat screen tvs...I don't really watch tv, but I'm sure a sports fan or news junkie would have been pleased. The iPhone/iPod charger didn't seem to work for my 4G, but I didn't try my Nano, so I'm not sure if it was just a compatibility issue. I loved the location.  Only a block or two away from the Zebra Lounge...a funky little piano bar with a tiny space but an excellent vibe.  Also, only blocks away from th Rush/Division bars that stay open all night and on warm nights, which this was, is a place where people congregate outside regularly.  Good people watching. The hotel staff was INCREDIBLY nice and accommodating.  When I called at 12:30 am for a turkey sandwich and chocolate pudding room service delivery, they forgot or messed it up and, not being a very fussy person, I didn't bother to call back to check on it until 4:30am, where they immediately said they were SO sorry and could they please sendit up now, gratis, and also could they buy me breakfast in the morning?  Yes and yes, thanks!  That was the best 5am turkey sandwich ever.  :) I really loved my stay here and will book again in the future.",4
578,"Stunning hotel. Knowledgeable and helpful staff. Room was 'ok', taking on a minimalist decor which i did not mind as much as the lack of comfort i experienced, particularly on the bed. Had breakfast in the restaurant once. Great food, good service and gorgeous setting, but I noticed they put up a 15 minute fuss when I wanted to pay in cash for what was a little more than a $20 meal. i didnt really quite understand what the fuss was all about. Sure, most customers will pay credit card for most payments, but surely a hotel establishment will make arrangements to accept cash as a form of payment. Really? I did think that was was totally ridiculous. They also made me wait 10 minutes before being seated when the restaurant was completely empty; table for 1 that is. However... coffee bar is fabulous with very yummy treats and a beautiful seating area with chess boxes and books to enjoy with your coffee. Excellent location. So close to everything you need.",4
579,"I stayed here for a few days in October 2011, shortly after it opened. I saw a great deal on http://hotels.com, and though I didn't know anything about Public, I was familiar with its predecessor, the Ambassador East, and read a few articles about Schrager's remodeling plans, so I decided to take advantage of the great price and make a reservation. Overall, it was a very good stay. The place is quite clean (as it should be, since it's practically brand new!) and sleek. The staff was friendly, though no one went ""above and beyond."" The fitness room was great, and I really liked the location - walkable to the Gold Coast/Mag Mile area and an L stop, but in a very nice residential area rather than in an entirely commercial area of downtown. Some of the decor was a bit too Euro trendy for me -- I could have done without the fake animal skin throw on the chair in the room, and a real bed instead of an almost-on-the-ground no-box spring Ikea-type bed. But all in all, the room was comfortable, if small. Computer area and library/coffee bar in the lobby was a nice touch. Biggest complaint: My room was right next to the elevator, and all night, I could hear the clank, clank, clank of the elevator pulleys and the doors opening and closing. Next time, I'll ask for a room away from the elevator. Overall, a very nice stay at an unbeatable price.",4
580,"My fiancé and I have stayed in several Ian Schrager hotels in San Francisco and New York. I thought it'd be hard for any hotel to knock the Clift in SF off thentopmof the charts, but Public does! Great staff, nice big clean rooms makes for a great weekend getaway. My fiancé and I had a great time here! Having the Pump Room downstairs helps too!",5
581,"From the minute we pulled into the entrance to the time we pulled out, we experienced incredible customer service. Our room was beautiful, unique, white, cool, crisp, hip, trendy, minimalist, soft, and stocked. The sheets and bed were so comfortable that we slept til 10 each day...among other things ;-) Very cool hotel. They really remade this into an instant classic.",5
582,"We had the pleasure of being a guest for the Opening Night event this week and I must say, I was blown away. This is true Ian Schrager style and cool charm without all the glitz and spangles and at a REASONABLE price point! Hotels seem to be reaching the breaking point with their prices for rooms these days.... The food was outstanding and the service was impeccable! EVERY employee, from the door man to the cleaning staff were most knowledgeable about the space, it's history as well as helpful and charming in their own way. Definitely a return spot for us and clients. I TOTALLY disagree with the post by the last person....js",5
583,"Trendy hotel, the rooms are pretty no frills they are pushing the minimalist thing here. The Pump Room is the place to be seen at lot of ""beautiful people"". Would stay here again when I am in town, got the room for free with my miles.",4
584,"Room and facilities were fine. Nice area to sit and have coffee in the morning, with good coffee and free WiFi (throughout the hotel, as all hotels should have). But we stayed on a Saturday night, and the whole lobby level is basically a nightclub. Plus, lots of noisy, boozing guests, guests with TVs blaring, etc. If you're a 20-something looking to party and aren't worried a good night's sleep, this place is fine. If you want, as I usually do, a peaceful place to relax and sleep, this ain't it.",2
585,"Well, if there was a rating for less than 1 star, that's what I'd be handing out.  The only redeeming quality seems to be the new bar in the Pump Room. I live one block from the hotel and have used the hotel (when it was the Ambassador) as my 'guest room'.  Well, this time I stayed at the hotel and allowed my guests to use my condo.  OH MY GOD!!!!  I'm so glad I did not let my guests stay at the hotel.  I would have been mortified.  I've not stayed at the hotel since it switched from the Ambassador.  I now can say 'I remember this place when it was a good hotel"".  Other than some cool lighting, the rooms are nothing more than cheap IKEA furniture.  There are no coffee makers in the room.  If you want coffee before 0630, you will be rudely told by the front desk young lady that you can walk over to Starbucks.  It's just over two blocks away.  A very easy walk however who the hell wants to do that at 0500???????  The staff is rude.  In general, one is made to feel that staff is being bothered by one's presence.  In fact, I think they thought they're doing me a favor by staying at their hotel. Public has managed to take what was a magnificent hotel with great customer service and turn it into nothing more that a cool looking Day Inn Motel or Hotel 6.",1
586,Their Greek Yogurt is to-die-for. I'm craving it already. And the ambiance is truly fabulous.,5
587,"Because I think Peter W's comment below is quite misleading, I wanted to make clear that I never had any conversations with him. The extent of the explanation provided to me of the issues is in full pasted below. I remain very interested in hearing what the alternate explanation of the power situation. All I have been given is a carefully worded response hinting that the issues were MINE. I believe I am very much owed this as a matter of customer service. Email received from event staff of PUBLIC: Dear Jeff, Thanks for your time on the phone yesterday. I am sorry that you had trouble with the sound for the party and with the bathroom incident in your guest room. Because I would really like you to return to the hotel and hopefully keep us in mind for other events or hotel needs, we would be happy to waive the cost of the speakers completely.  Everyone seems to have a different story but I enjoyed working with you and would like to do so in the future. I will have a revised invoice sent next week when accounting returns. Happy Holidays and please let me know if I can be of further assistance.",2
588,"Wow.  We stayed here last summer while it was under renovation and were pretty disappointed.  What a difference a year makes.  Now the combination of the great location, great staff and great new look make this a place to come back to.",4
589,"Hotel management came to a resolution on my earlier complaint, so this is a deserved update. I don't love everything about this hotel -- the modern face-lift on old infrastructure shows through sometimes -- but it is a great hotel at not-unreasonable rates. They also have free wifi, which every hotel in the world should offer, but for some reason many still charge $10+/day (crazy).",4
590,"Just opened but you'd never guess it. Great staff, great feel and look. SERVICE WAS FABULOUS during my business stay for a week! Although i do like modern and busy hotels. If you are a light sleeper it may be tough...the walls are a bit thin and it is a hot spot for nightlife activity, but i enjoyed the accommodations, service, food and staff very much!",4
591,"I can't say enough great things about my experience at the Public Hotel. Not only will I stay here on my future trips to Chicago, the hotel alone makes me want to come back as soon as possible! Here are just a few of the reasons why I love this place: 1. Every single staff person throughout the hotel was friendly, warm, and welcoming. (They must hire them all from a modeling agency because they are unbelievably good-looking too!) 2. The public spaces are not only interesting looking and luxurious but also comfortable! If I have to spend 3 hours working at my hotel, why not do so sitting in a cozy sheep skin-covered chair, next to a fireplace with a delicious coffee drink! 3. Speaking of drinks, the cocktail menu is interesting and delicious as is the food menu. I haven't eaten so well since... I can't remember when! And yet the prices are affordable! 4. The social scene here is very cool. People of all races, ages, and styles make for great people watching but the mid-western charm of the clientele made me forget I was rubbing elbows with the chic and glamorous. 5. Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel is just an acknowledgment that we are living in a technology world and should do so without limitations. Charging for internet is like charging for air. 6. Free access to the nicest gym I have ever been to: totally unique design, more pretty people, AMAZING classes, (I'm still sore!), and top-quality gym equipment. 7. Perfect location - walking distance to restaurants, shops along the miracle mile, and just steps away from the shore, (you can't beat that view!) I could go on but I shouldn't need to. Book your room now! You won't regret it.",5
592,Absolutely love Public Chicago...BTW the best morning coffee ever...Stayed 3x in the last 2 months...excellent service,5
593,"I was initially excited about this hotel, but after staying here a couple of nights, I was disappointed. We had a 2 room suite, and while the rooms were large, the bathroom  was tiny for the size of the suite, but it had two walk-in closets. Who needs that? Go figure. Also, if you drink coffee, there is no coffee maker in the room, forcing you to order room service at $7-9 dollars a pot. No hair  dryer in the room, and minimal toiletries. They didn't even replace them the next day. We had requested a room early on the highest floor and they gave us one on the 6th. It has 17 stories, I believe. Also there is not even any complimentary coffee in the lobby. I went to the bar area to buy some. $3.50 a cup! I just went and got some down the street at Starbucks. Also, no exhaust fans in the rooms. On, the positive side, the lobby and Pump Room were renovated well, and full of trendy people on Friday and Saturday night. The staff was nice and efficient, good customer service for the most part. The drink prices are on the high side, even for Chicago. Would I stay here again? No, there are much better places in Chicago.",2
594,"- a cacophony - an expectant bustle - a needy discomfort - a collection of types looking at you - you, in turn, look at them - such anticipation - as if something worth marveling over has only almost arrived - as if greatness can be achieved by osmosis - as if perhaps the photographers are late - all this in precise unbreachable surroundings -",3
595,"Upon entering the hotel, I knew that I'd found my home away from home. It wins the prize for best lobby- you'll actually want to hang out there and with rooms decorated in creams and whites, I easily conjured heavenly and celestial images. The express lunch offerings are genius- I recommend the beef brisket sandwich. My husband declared that the morning coffee offered in the library is the best he's ever tasted. The freshly baked pastries, specifically the blueberry muffin, is a must for getting your day started. The gym, though small, is well-appointed and had everything I  needed.  The staff is warm, friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location nestled in a pristine residential area but close to the beach, and in walking distance to the Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park and the action on State Street. If you're looking for a fun yet relaxing place to stay where you'll feel comfortable but not miss any of the Chicago's energy, stay at the Public Chicago. Wins the prize for best lobby- you'll actually want to hang out in it.",5
596,I come up to Chicago about once a month to see my girlfriend and tend to stay at a different hotel everytime i visit. So when it came to NYE I thought why not pick a new hotel and decided on Public Chicago. My gf and I were enamored with the place from the minute we got out of our cab. The  guys working outside to the clerks working the check in were very hospitable and friendly. We both loved the decor of our room. What's also nice is the hotel is near rush and division and not that far from Michigan Ave. Next time I'm in Chicago I will definitely stay here again.,5
597,Great bar and lounge area and as another reviewer mentioned staffed by very good looking people.,4
598,"Many positives to this hotel.  The service was great here, the rooms large, nice fitness room, great location, views, safe area to walk around at night (woman travelling alone, so very important).   The room was modern and took a bit getting used to with the very low bed and more austere deck chair, but ended up being pretty comfortable. While quite spacious as far as square footage, the area for clothing was tight, so would have been difficult with more than one person.   As often happens in the older hotels, the bathroom also was tight, small shower and very little counter space for hair drying make up application, etc.  Net is I would definitely stay here again as a single, but would look for something with more clothing and bath space if travelling with my husband.",3
599,"I have now been to Public twice and they have won me over. My first trip, I missed the old Ambassador East but now I am a Public fan won over by the friendly staff, cleanliness, service and fun vibe. Well done Public!",4
600,"This was a great hotel.  They let me check in at 6am and they even upgraded my room.  I stayed here for 4 days and I got cookies every morning and they have all the amenities you need.  It is close to public transit and is nearby shops, restaurants and everything else in downtown.  They have a nice somewhat-rooftop deck with a pool (massive spiders on the rails on the steps up)  I would of given them a few stars off for the spiders but the hospitality here was next to none.  I will stay here again! BTW parking is $33 a day",5
601,"So I live just 12 miles North of here in Evanston, but decided to stay at a hotel off Magnificent Mile so I could be close to a conference a few blocks away. Pros: * Location (a few blocks from Ohio St. Beach; a few blocks from Michigan Ave.) * Relatively cheap for a brand name hotel close to Magnificent Mile * Good quality pillows * Cute (gimmick-y) chocolate chip cookie upon arrival Cons: * Unreliable elevators. At any given time, only 2 out of the 5 elevators will be functioning (sometimes only 1 at a time!). I've seen people waiting for 15+ minutes on the ground floor waiting for the elevator. I waited 5 minutes to catch the elevator from the 6th floor going down. This is unacceptable. * Spotty wi-fi. I paid to get wi-fi and not some trash that loses connectivity every few hours even though all my devices still say 'connected'. * Under-stocked hotel bar in lobby. It was my birthday and a colleague of mine wanted to buy me a drink--just about everything I wanted seemed out of reach given the supply here. TL;DR - Cheap given its location, but I wouldn't come back.",3
602,"If I am ever in Chicago again, I definitely will stay here. Our room was clean, comfortable and inviting. Every staff member was professional. Carolyn on the cleaning staff let us use the staff elevator when we mentioned that there were 3 full elevators that stopped on our floor and we had been waiting for about 10 minutes! I thought that was superb customer service. The location is very close to Michigan Ave and certainly within walking distance to Mag Mile.",4
603,"I would give this hotel a 3.5. Having visited Chicago many times and having stayed in several similar hotels, this offered a larger room than we usually have in Chicago. The location is near pretty much everything downtown and has two bus stops within a block. My complaint would be that they came by to service the room at 8:45 am. Naturally, being on a trip for leisure, we were not out of the room at this time, but didnt have the do not disturb on the door because we were planning to be out by 10. Unfortunately because we were not ready for the room to be serviced at 8:45, it was not cleaned! This happened two days in a row. It just seems senseless to me to not plan to clean rooms that will remain occupied for a few more days later than 8:45. I didnt have any of the issues with the televisions (big flat screen in our room) or elevators (fast and always available). I would definitely stay here again, but would have had a better experience if the room cleaning had been different.",3
604,"Parking: totally sucks! self-parking overnight is $45. The elevator/garage area is not very clean and is obvious that it's not been attended to.. No A/C, paint chipping, not a good look! Check-in: Staff was very pleasant and it was very easy and quick. Room: Very small! There is a small closet door that kept getting stuck- and with it stuck, you can't open the front door, so it was very frustrating.  Room was clean overall, but bathroom can use some updating. Also, the A/C / heater unit is extremely loud.. I kept waking up through the night when it turned on. Lounge: there's no lounge here. Business center: You can take the stairs down to the business center from the  lobby. OR you can take the elevator down, then take the stairs up to the business center. For someone traveling with a suitcase, I find it annoying that it's not on a floor where it has ready-elevator access on the same floor.  Not to mention that it costs to use the computer and to print; and the printer-on software wasn't functioning. Breakfast: It's one of the better breakfasts I've had! Eggs, potatoes, AWESOME sausages, fresh fruit, coffee, the usual. But the quality is much better than many other hotel breakfast buffets. I will not likely stay here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it either.",3
605,"Nice hotel for a conference. We stay there every summer.  They've updated the rooms and lobby over the past couple of years.  It's in a great location, central to anything you might want to see and do in your free time.  And the cookies are good :-) Staff is really great too!",4
606,"I did this place last week as a little overnight get away. I also did not know that they damn restaurant show was in town as well and half the show was booked in that hotel. Anyways, it's in a fantastic location and everyone I dealt with at the hotel was extrememly nice and helpful. It was a horribly rainy day when we arrived, but the lobby was spotless and fresh smelling. We were checked in quickly and got our free cookies... WOOHOO!! (Got one later too!) The room was spotless with a great view. Extememly quiet and the bed was like a cloud. So much that I took an quick hour nap and forgot who I was... or was that the Jameson...  Up, out and on the town to the Cubs game for an awesome night and wrapped it up with a free breakfast in the hotel the following morning. Again, good tasting, clean, plenty of staff and friendly!",5
607,"Good price in a great location (set back from Michigan Ave with easy access to it) with cookies when you check in. Not a whole lot else a gal could ask for! Room was spacious and tidy, and the bed was comfortable. The shower was also great and service was helpful when needed. Hotel has also recently been remodeled which is nice. The lobby has ample seating and a cozy feel. Breakfast is not included(no surprises here) but there is an Einstein's in the lobby if you need to grab a quick bagel or a coffee (though there is a coffee maker in the room as well).",3
608,"The Doubletree Magnificent Mile is exceptional! Our room was comfortable with a great view. We were within walking distance to Navy Pier, Michigan Ave, Millenium Park, lots of places to eat & drink...  The staff was extremely friendly and efficient, our son is a big fan on Pablo. Only drawback, free wifi in lobby only, slow elevators and front driveway construction was a bit of a nuisance. Highly recommend!",4
609,Nice hotel in the right location. They are currently doing some renovations but I didn't feel like it got in my way at all. Try Timothy O'Toole's Irish Pub across the street for some really good bar food.,4
610,"A friend and I stayed here on a recent vacation to Chicago.  As it was our first time in the city, we were most concerned with finding a hotel centrally located to many of the Chicago tourist attractions, as we were not renting a car. Not only is the Doubletree in a great location, but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the rooms were nearly everything we could have hoped for.  The only thing missing in the room was a fridge (what is one to do with all that left over deep dish pizza?!?!).   The hotel is a 5 minute walk to Michigan Ave (shopping, restaurants, etc) and a 10 minute walk to the train station.  Also within walking distance (bring your walking shoes) are the Chicago River, Millennium Park, Grant Park, The Art Institute & Willis Tower. Although check in is at 3pm, we were allowed to check in at 1:45pm and were given some delicious chocolate chip cookies!   The room was cleaned nicely every day and when I requested a firmer pillow, the maid service brought not 1, but 2 pillows.  The concierge staff was helpful when it came time for dining and public transit recommendations. If I ever happen to visit Chicago in the future, I will definitely consider staying at the Doubletree Magnificent Mile.",4
611,"Fresh Cookies Daily!!! I am surprisingly satisfied with the Double Tree... Yes, its an older hotel and its not the fanciest nor is it the cutest little boutique hotel, but its functional and clean. - Check in and Check out... done with ease - Fresh and warm cookies every day! (you just have to ask for them at the check in desk) - Comfy and clean bed - Clean Room - Crabtree & Evelyn Toiletries (One of my faves!) - About 4 short walking blocks to Michigan Avenue - Hotel towncar ($45 to airport), which was cheaper than the $55 flat cab rate - Super friendly staff. Always had smiles.",4
612,"My best friend hates to fly...She even hates it more when the flight lasts more than two hours. A flight to Chicago for us was about 4. She decided to go around this by booking us on a red-eye out, hoping she could pass out and wake up refreshed in Chicago....Perfect plan, except..... Our plane touched down in Chicago at 5:45am...Most hotels don't let you check in until 3pm. This was going to be interesting. We arrived at Doubletree shortly after and were greeted by the front desk person...Or maybe ""greeted"" is too generous. I'm pretty sure he kinda just nodded. Hmmm. We asked if there was anyway to check in early but he explained that they were completely booked solid and he didn't have anything available. I asked if we could get a room once people started checking out and he told me, ""I don't know, you're going to have to get with the first shift about that"" Huh? I don't speak hotel lingo, but I'm no idiot. He basically said, ""I don't care, it's not my problem but the next shift might care and want to fix your problem"" Whatever. We checked our bags and hit the pavement. Great location....comfy beds....and cookies....Einstein Bagels downstairs with my favorite coffee.....Pluses! I couldn't 4 star this joint because of the busted elevator, or maybe it wasn't busted but there was only one that worked at any given time....took forever.....sardine can style every ride no matter what time of day or night... And of course the douchey night audit guy we met our first morning there...what a miserable little person. If you can avoid this d-bag and get lucky with the elevator, I would recommend this property.",3
613,"Overall its a decent hotel. The advantages are great Hilton family services, very comfy beds, free DT cookies, and the hotel restaurant was very good. The disadvantages are they charge for WiFi, bad HVAC system, funny smell in the hallways and really slow elevators. I also found it to be a loud hotel since they didn't have thick enough walls or good enough windows.",3
614,"As others have mentioned, warm chocolate cookies upon check-in were delicious! A great treat after a long flight from the west coast to Chicago. Great location. Walking distance to Navy Pier and to Magnificent Mile. I got a good deal from priceline but unfortunately, we got a room on the 3rd floor with basically no view. Beds and pillows were very comfortable! Room was cleaned everyday with no issues. Sucks there is no free wifi in the rooms but there is AT&T wifi available as well as free wifi down in the lounge. Didn't use the gym but the equipment looked new. Overall a pleasant stay for our trip to Chicago.",3
615,"I wanted to steal the pillows.  The best pillows of any hotel I have stayed in to date.  I think they have a site where one can order them.  I have to check it out.   The service was excellent from every person I encountered in the hotel and even from the Einstein's bagel shop which is, oh so conveniently, located in the lobby. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious.  The bathroom was large and the shower provided instant hot water.  There was a nice window seat. Room service was prompt and the food was good.  Beware: the stuffed burger feeds two and will put you in a coma. I did not give all 5 stars, as I did not check out the gym,, the restaurant, etc. The room I had was one of those doubles that has a door leading to the next room: not sound proof.  So, I had to endure an argument of the couple next door.  I let them get it out, and it quieted down nicely.",4
616,"Stayed for a week for biz and pleasure.  As others have said, it couldn't be better located, within walking distance to shopping, sites, and restaurants. Housekeeping staff were fantastic, and always had my room cleaned and enjoyable to return to after sightseeing.   Check-in/out was easy, though they did accidentally give me somebody else's bill under the door along with my own.  Initially reading it I was thinking I'd been doubled charged for a couple days of my stay, but then realized it was under another name.  Front desk quickly resolved it when I walked it down.   Front desk staff were very personable and professional. The rooms are well-appointed.   I would only ask for two considerations: 1) wi-fi shouldn't be based ""per device.""  I signed up on my iphone to access email while on my bed, and then when I went to use my laptop to complete some work I became aware that I had to repurchase wi-fi for that, and, if I chose to, again for my IPad.  That would be $30 for the same person.  I'm sure there are some couples out there, too, that wouldn't want to have to pay twice to obtain their emails on different phones.  You could charge a room rate, and let it go at that.  Also, as another reviewer said -- what to do with leftovers from the fantastic restaurants, including the hotel's own?  The pressure sensitive mini-bar essentially eliminates the option of taking a soda or snacks out of the mini-bar to put something in (leftover pizza, dessert, my own bottled water, whatever).   I also had a problem with my room phone sometime after day 2 -- no dial tone and couldn't be used.  I ended up needing to call the front desk for something and had to use my own phone.  Told them while I spoke about the other issue that my room phone wasn't making calls, but they didn't send anybody.  A night later, I had to call the main desk via my cell to get connected to room service, and I mentioned again I was calling because my room phone wasn't letting me make calls; no action. One other disappointment: the fitness center.  Several pieces of cardio but only 1 leg option and a multi-function piece.  If somebody else was doing their workout when you came in (as happened several times), you're stuck with cardio.  I actually found a gym a couple blocks away that had more equipment and offered a 6 session pass so that I could get in the sessions I needed.  One plus though, the Doubletree fitness center is open 24 hours -- many hotels arbitrarily close at 10 or 11p.  Still, if a good workout is important during your stay, consider other locations. That said, it was affordable, even inclusive of a holiday weekend.  My stay averaged $160.  I had considered the Intercontinental two blocks away, but that was $75 per night more...may have been somewhat better appointed according to a couple biz colleagues, but why pay so much more if you can have an overall good experience for significantly less?  And cookies, too. =)",3
617,"3.5 stars. I want to give this place higher, but a couple of things just didn't cut it. Let's start with the positives, then move to the negatives. Pros - location: near Michigan Street a couple bus stops, which help - cookies: try them & you'll understand - lobby w/ free wi-fi - nice gym (open 24 hours a day) - comfy beds - nice pool Cons - my parents & bro/sis had a hard time getting extra toilet paper - the maid service took all day - a shower leaked/broke and took a while to fix - a charge for wi-fi in the rooms per day Overall we were pleased, but if you take the location away it might just be 3 stars. We got a pretty good price and we weren't in the hotel much anyways. I'm thinking I wouldn't mind staying there again if I visit, but I'd probably take my chances on Priceline and see what I get.",3
618,"Stayed here for a small/mid-sized professional conference.  Our room rate was secured at $99 with discounted parking and free wifi.  For the price and location, you couldn't beat it.  I ended up driving to the city and the hotel was easy to find, parking was convenient.  Bed was comfy, pillows were good, concierge was very helpful.  The room temp was easy to control (but the a/c was loud).  Walkable for many attractions and train.",4
619,"Pro's - Einstein bagels in the lobby - Warm cookies when you check-in - Great restaurants/bars nearby (Timothy O'toole's, West Egg Cafe & Gyu Kaku) - Close to Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier and all the stores - Free wi-fi in Lobby - Decent price. We got it on Priceline for about $120/night Con's -Doesn't include continental breakfast -The smoking floors are AWFUL!! Cannot believe people can smoke in hotels there - 3 out of the 4 nights we stayed there our ""do not disturb"" sign disappeared in the morning and the maid woke us up....not a happy camper!! - Walls are thin so we heard the man next door to us coughing/throwing up two mornings in a row",2
620,"Cashed some points out and got 2 nights at Doubletree MM. New flat screen HDTV in our room (21st floor being a Hilton Honors floor). We got a ""special needs room"".....you can tell as these rooms have no bathtub just a straight walk in shower. Also there are 2 ""peep holes"" in the door. One for standing folks and an additional peep hole for folks in wheel chairs. Did not eat here but did avail ourselves of the Einstein Bagels. Those $4.50 frozen drinks tasted good. The pool has some nice views: Hancock, Trump, Tribune Tower and that really cool blue top building that I never remember the name of. Great location. Michigan Avenue is 2 blocks away. Navy Pier is 15 minute walk. The only downside was no hot water the first day we were here....quickly fixed by maintenance. Overall a good experience.",4
621,"Stayed here 4 nights during my first time visiting Chicago.  Couldn't be more impressed: 1.  Service: Every Doubletree employee was SO nice and helpful.  They helped with directions, always had a pleasant demeanor, and let us check our luggage into a room since our checkout was in the afternoon and our flight was during the evening.   2. Beds- These beds are INCREDIBLE.  I must admit that although I was excited to be exploring Chicago for the first time, there were moments that I thought about how excited I was to get back to the hotel so I can curl up in the bed.  Yes, they were THAT amazing. 3. Location- the location is perfect.  it's right in the middle of shopping & dining, and public transportation...we had no problems getting around and catching buses within a block from us. 4.  The smell-I have no idea what scent Doubletree uses but I want to buy it in a bottle and febreze my closet, sheets, and apartment in this scent!!! The entire hotel smells sooooo gooood. Thank you, Doubletree Magnificent Mile.",5
622,"I indeed had sweet dreams last nite at the Doubletree Magnificent Mile. We were there for one night. It took about a minute to check in, we grabbed our delicious chocolate chip cookies and headed to our room, that was clean, spacious and lovely (lots of pillows and a great bed). We used the concierge services to book a tour and they were knowledgeable and friendly. Love the location, right in the middle of all the action and the price we got on Hotwire was very reasonable. Like others have said the parking is $41 but that is actually cheaper than many other hotels in the area. We saw signs advertising close to $60. It's downtown, to be expected. Only disappointing factor was the wifi situation. We wanted to look up some addresses but did not want to pay over $20 for decent internet speed. I was even going to go for the standard grade at $10 for 24 hours but it wouldn't let me charge it to my credit card, only the room (there was an option for it but it wouldn't activate). We stayed at another Doubletree this past week in another city and their internet was free. But that was only a minor disappointment in another wise lovely stay.",4
623,"Great service, location and rooms. The cookies are awesome. I ordered and got two boxes for some friends when I checked out!",4
624,"One Liner for those needing a fast read:  Good choice if you get a GREAT price (under $100). Excellent location and great service at the front desk.  They even let us check in early (11am)! However, the rooms were not the cleanest that they could have been.  For example, we dropped something under the bed and were surprised to find all kinds of trash and ""remnants"" from other guests.  Yuck. Additionally, we got the ONE room on the 5th floor that is by the ice machine...not good. Very loud all night...not just people filling their buckets, but also water running in a pipe to fill it. It should be noted that the pool is OUTDOORS, so to use it in March wasn't possible. The description should make this distinction. There is an indoor pool to use for a $15 fee per person. Overall though, for the Hotwire price of $77 ($88 with tax), this was a good stay and the location was right.  Note that overnight parking is $41 with in and out privileges.",3
625,"Can you believe that I was a model in a fashion show here? This is what the world has come to. Suck it. I didn't stay here but hung out in the public areas. Nice hotel, Clean and conveniently located. Standard banquet spaces. Generic hotel bar in the lobby. $8 for a beer. Ouch.",3
626,"I am not impressed with the Doubletree.  The first room we tried smelled like an ash tray.  Not very appealing when you specifically reqeust a non-smoking room.  We headed back down to the front desk and luckily scored another room.  This room was fine - ok, kind of clean, not sparkly and new...just meh.  The parking was over $40 and it was self-park!  Ridiculous!!!  The breakfast for HH members was the continental buffet only, but don't be fooled, you can order off the menu (we didn't know this until we heard another customer ask).  The cont. buffet was depressing-The best item was the Dannon Yogurt and the muffins tasted like saw dust. We did not spend any time downtown, so perhaps my review would be better if we were looking for an excellent location near Michigan Ave.  I think I am becoming a hotel snob!",2
627,"Pleased w/the hotel despite the initial biatchy front desk gal & the miscommunication about the type of room, got smoking.  ICK!!!   Transferred into a non-smoking room after the first night & it was literally what the pillows stated, 'Sweet Dreams': -Lots of pillows -Neutrogena bath products -Fluffy towels -Chewy, warm walnut choco cookies, that STAY chewy.  OMG. -Numi tea bags -Wolfgang Puck coffee -Super friendly doormen -Location, location, location. Check out was seamless & I wouldn't hesitate to book nights here again.",4
628,"What you are going to get here is your standard Hilton stay.  Don't expect anything fancy.   Positives: Great location. Clean rooms. Comfortable bed and pillows. Great views. Great service. Kiosk for boarding passes Negatives: That Hilton room decor Loud air conditioning No free wireless in the rooms (come on, get with the times here) Overall though...a comfortable stay which is all I need on a business trip.",4
629,"Please put in some fans in the bathrooms! Why do most of the hotels I stay in these days forgo the wonder of a fan? Water gets on the ceiling, the mirror is foggy, and well, you know, sometimes you need one for other unmentionables. The rooftop pool was not as awesome as the photos would lead you to believe - not really a surprise, though. Check in and out was easy - also easy to sneak extra people into a room as the lobby is always packed and has folks milling around constantly. Our room was cleaned even though we hung out a ""do not disturb"" sign, which was kind of annoying.... We pricelined the hotel and got a great deal for two nights, so it was worth the money.  The hotel restaurant/bar is actually pretty decent as well! We enjoyed a late night 20% off bottle of wine...yummy wine.",3
630,"I love Doubletrees in general because they have the best chocolate chip walnut cookie!! I'm absolutely obsessed with them. 5 stars for the following: -Cookies when you check in -Fast check in process and friendly staff -Rooms are clean -The beds are comfy and firm mattress -The location is great, right by Navy Pier and close to bus stops and Michigan -Cookies whenever you ask for them!! And I asked (....a lot) - Room price was ~ $150 a night -Check out was fast and the lady gave me two cookies!!! YUM. -Einstein bagels open inside -Good location for Lollapalooza Oh and the cookies here are good!",5
631,"HORRIBLE!!!  Management is to blame!   1.  No doorman was on staff to help open the door despite the amount of luggage I had... CORRECTION!  There was a doorman, but HE CHOSE TO IGNORE ME!! 2.  RON, the front desk guy informed me it wasn't his problem that no doorman was on staff... Thank you! 3.  COFFEE MAKER?  Seriously, do you check your rooms before admitting new guests - you have a fridge but I can't keep anything in it?? *** After making a request for one, you STILL MAKE ME WAIT 30mins plus for it, WTF?!/! 4.  Air Conditioner - OMG!!!  That thing is loud!!  When I said LOUD I mean seriously loud, waking up in the middle of the night loud! 5.  STARCHY Sheets!! I don't understand, some downey wouldn't hurt. 6.  Modern Decor completely misses the ball, the burgundy, green & brown combination was not doing this place justice... (if there was any for this place!!) DON'T STAY HERE!!  It's really not worth it!  I have stayed at many hotels such as Swissotel and Fairmont and NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING was THIS BAD!!! I wish the management would train their employees to be more friendly, help each other out and remind them that they are their to service their guests!",2
632,"Very nice hotel! Friendly people, an extremely comfortable bed and yes, the pillows were awesome! Supposedly they have free internet in the lobby???I wasn't there for business, so I didn't need it. Very nice work out room. Awesome restaurants nearby (check out the Armenian one and the bakery on Illinois near navy pier). Great price, 75/night! Concierge was very helpful and the coffee in the room was very good! No complaints, we will be back!",5
633,"My daughter and I stayed here on Tuesday night while in town visiting another daughter who is moving to DeKalb with her husband.  The Doubletree had a great special mid-week price of $90.  The hotel room was clean and had a lot of extra amenities -- such as Neutragena SPF face cream and cleanser along with the usual shampoo, conditioner and body lotion.  Also, you are greeted upon checkin with warm, fresh chocolate chip cookies. Didn't try the workout room, but it looked very adequate.  The hotel staff is friendly and anxious to please. The parking was expensive - $41 for about 24 hours - but that is expected in Chicago.",4
634,I stayed here for three nights. The service was friendly and our room was very clean. i will definitely stay here again during my next trip to Chicago.,5
635,"Reasonable rates.  Friendly to families.  Great location.  Beds were very comfortable and the shower was HOT!  Down the street from a grocery store, and several other cheap dining options.   Market House, the in hotel restaurant was very nice, a bit upscale but not prohibitive, and very welcoming to children.  We would stay here again.",4
636,"I had moderate to high expectations from this place. But I was very unimpressed. We checked in pretty late at night, the person at the front desk was a lady, she was ok but either did not understand my question or did not want to answer it. I asked the lady for a room with a view, and she said, ""here are your keys, your room faces south."" I asked again, ""does it have a nice view."" Her response: ""it faces south."" UM OK? By the way, it did not have a nice view. All I saw was the building in front of me, which was all glass. I thought maybe our window was the kind of glass where we could look out, but no one could look in. No, I was wrong. I could see myself in the glass window of the building across from us. The bed was comfortable and the room was pretty clean. The next morning, I had to print something for a conference, so I went to the business center, and the internet was (I think) about $6 for 15 minutes. They REALLY should NOT be charging to use internet in the business center. I understand if you charge for internet in the rooms, but really?? The internet was SO SLOW. It took 15 minutes to load http://gmail.com and open a one-page word document. I called the guy in-charge of this, his name was ""Eddie."" He was unapologetic and said ""people use this all the time."" Then he swiped his card on the other computer and asked me to use it, again same thing. It was SO SLOW and did not load. Eddie still did not apologize or anything. I looked for a fedex closeby and found one in the Marriott. It worked flawlessly. The next thing to happen was that my room key did not work. The REALLY RUDE woman at the front desk said, ""if you keep the key near your phone, it deactivates."" Well, I did not keep it near the phone, so I don't know why it deactivated. Also, there were two other people in line whose keys also were deactivated. Third bad thing: the showers are difficult to figure out. Seriously? You need instructions for the showers. All in all, not worth the price and I am definitely not going back and not recommending it to anyone else. You can get better service and experience in another hotel for sure.",2
637,"I had no real experience with the Doubletree, but seeing as it was a Hilton, I had some expectations.  Upon inspecting the website, the rooms looked very sophisticated and modern.  When arriving the main lobby was very spacious, smelled amazing and had many friendly employees to help out.  They gave us our free cookies and kept them coming throughout the stay.  However, once arriving to our floor (4th), the experience started a downward spiral.  The hallway was not air conditioned, and extremely muggy and hot.  Our unit was nice and cool, however did not have the flat screen television that was on the website, but our 27 inch tv was fine.  Other electronic snafus included the house phone on the nightstand not working as well as our mini-fridge having a sensory-based system so we couldn't even take out the items to keep our drinks cool.  There were also snacks upon the counter that the stated that it was electronically weighed and if you touch it, you will be charged.  Families traveling with small children must have a lot of charges!  The cleanliness of the bathroom was less than desired.  There was painted-over mold on the ceiling as well as chipping paint.  Likewise, there were stains on the wall above one of the beds.  The blankets were amazing and down, however the pillows were too soft and there were no extra blankets.  The satellite also went out multiple times, which was probably due to storms at least one night.   The location was very convenient and riding the CTA wasn't challenging at all.  Due to the few issues we had with cleanliness and electronics, I may be deterred from staying here again.",2
638,"I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute I spent at this hotel. Three nights here and no qualms whatsoever. Awesome location. Within walking distance of Navy Pier, The John Hancock Center, and fabulous Michigan Avenue shopping. If you need to go anywhere else, ask the doorman (who's UNBELIEVABLY attractive) to hail you a taxi. Cool looking lobby with a bar. Adjacent Einstein's Bagels. Excellent staff who make sure you're feeling welcome. Cookies at check in - delicious ones at that. The front desk people here are great. Really friendly and took care of my stupidity of placing my roomkey next to my credit cards and BlackBerry. Very clean, with cute rooms that are decorated nicely. Super comfy beds! And the thing that I judge any hotel by...the water pressure for the shower was unparalleled. This hotel is a winner.",5
639,"I enjoyed my 3 night stay  here. The only thing I didn't like about my room was that it didn't have a microwave or  a fridge. I mean they provided us with chilled alcohol and water in this mini cooler looking thing and also candies and snacks (none of these we touched). lol Also, for some odd reason...i noticed that hilton hotels do not have any fans in the restrooms. lol Other than that, I loved their beds and their cookies. I asked for their delicious cookies when I checked in, walked out of the hotel, came in the hotel, and checked out of the hotel.  lol  It's that good!   We stayed on the 18th floor so we got a nice view of the swimming pool and downtown. This location is great, close to the navy pier and you can just walk to all the shops.",4
640,"Awesome hotel, good location and deal. Playstation in the room!!!  Free wi-fi if you go into the lounge downstairs, I guess that's cute so people can socialize.  Great during our Holiday trip to Chi town!",5
641,"Great hotel. Stayed there three nights and enjoyed my time in Chicago. -Clean rooms -Great location (close to Michigan Ave, John Hancock, Navy Pier, Gino's East) -Great price w/ expedia (80/night for two queens, non-smoking) -Free internet if you plug your laptop into the network downstairs at their  business center. -Cookie at check-in -Only reason i won't give them five stars is because of the thin walls. We were able to hear music coming through from next door. But it really wasn't a problem.",4
642,"The bellmen here are the nicest!  Antonio, Rafael and Derrick were genuinely friendly and helpful.  Rather than taking a cab to the airport, Derrick recommended a car service that was prompt, reasonably priced, and the smoothest, safest ride I could have asked for - ask for Mike!  Convenient location with Panera in the next block.",4
643,"Service - Superb.  They even allowed us to check in at noon and gave us amazing chocolate chip cookies!  Kudos to the front desk, cleaning crew and bell boys.  Everyone was really friendly and had a great attitude. Location - Unbeatable location and price!  A block from the heart of Magnificient Mile for a low promotional price. Ambiance - Swanky and busy.  Fireplace at the bar although I never saw it open for business. Rooms - Pros - Spacious, great view, Crabtree and Evelyn products, safe, trash can has a recyclable container, looks just like photos. Cons - Lump beds, super soft pillows, no one answered the front desk for twenty minutes when I called at 1 am.",4
644,"I'm writing my review based on the overall experience I had with the staff and services of the hotel and the people that helped me make my wedding a HUGE success! Both ceremony and reception took place here in their LaSalle Ballroom and I will post pictures once I get them from my photographer.  The ballroom is decorated with beautiful chandeliers in an amber wash but the carpet, though new, is slightly hideous - but I guess hotels have to have ""busy"" carpets to keep the dirt from showing. Rebecca Kuzelka - the most amazing and organized wedding coordinator ever!  There is something to be said about someone who already has a full plate on her hands, yet she does an incredible jobs of making ME, the bride, feel like I am her ONLY account.  Her attention to detail, her proactive spirit to make sure I have not forgotten anything (when there is so much going on, only a professional like Rebecca can point out the little details that may have been overlooked).  I had 10 months to plan my wedding and unfortunately, the person that I signed the contract with decided not to show up to work one day and I was lost without a coordinator for over two months.  Rebecca took on the position in June and was on top of everything as soon as she started.  What also made it really easy was that her ""style"" was similar to mine - Minimalistic and trendy - so the way she executed her job was the same way I envisioned my wedding.  Of course, I did my homework and outlined everything I needed done and was worried that the actual day wouldn't go smoothly - However, the day was seamless and I put my FULL trust in her and she made my day the happiest day of my life (well almost, marrying my best friend was even better)!  She organized all my vendors, all the staff, ensured everyone was where they needed to be and had everything done before I even thought about it.  I couldn't have been happier! Ben - I guess he is the lead doorman - Wow - he treated my guests with a smile all the time, no matter how long his shift was!  Thanks Ben! Alfredo - awesome concierge - really took care of me and my out of town guests who probably bombarded him with questions and reservations of all sorts - Friendly and professional Chef Alfredo - Executive Chef - I had always wanted an Asian Fusion menu for my wedding because I knew that the traditional Chinese banquet would not suit all the palates of my friends. He welcomed all my suggestions to incorporate many of the Chinese traditions of a wedding menu.  We were able to include roast pork, peking duck, udon noodles, wasabi, ginger, enoki mushrooms, bok choy and fish into the menus and the food was incredible!  We requested medium rare filets for all who ordered it and they were all cooked PERFECTLY medium rare!  It's not easy to cook for 85 guests to perfection but all of my guest said that this was the BEST wedding meal they have EVER had in their life.  I think the Hors D'oeurves were really the star of the show, people couldn't stop eating them! Waitstaff during the reception - I don't remember the name of the head honcho there, but he was extremely attentive to our needs during dinner, making sure that we enjoyed our food and it was hot enough etc.  His wait staff was classy and elegant serving everything butler style in tuxedos and white gloves!  Loved it! Bridal Suite - We were booked into room 2616 which is the Michigan Suite - gorgeous city views with a HUGE dining table, wet bar, seating area for 10, a Murphy Bed - then adjacent to the room was the master bedroom and a giant bathroom with a standing shower and a bathtub fit for two.  Largely impressed with this and tastefully decorated (recently renovated).  It also had an alarm clock with iPod connections but the TV was outdated and no DVD player in the room.  Our king sized bed was super comfy and the murphy bed even, was AWESOME - my maid of honor slept there the night before and she has insomnia - even she was able to catch a couple hours of zzz's prior to the big day! I'm so thankful for the people at the Doubletree who made this a great day for us!  I recommend the staff and services of this hotel to anyone looking for a wedding venue in downtown Chicago.",5
645,"I've never actually stayed in this hotel. However, I stayed at a Doubletree before in Austin, and really liked their cookies. So when I see a Doubletree in the Chi i decide to ask if I could get some cookies, and they were super nice. They gave us one for each of us (3) no charge. So 5 stars for that cuz those cookies are fucking incredible.",5
646,"My sorority hosted our convention in beautiful summery Chicago and booked all of us here. 200+ women all in one hotel ...yep, a lotta ladies and googly-eyed men. I arrived in the late afternoon to hundreds of sisters as well as another company's convention and regular guests. I thought, ""oh man, this is gonna suck."" I was surprised because check-in was fast and sweet. We got warm cookies with our room keys (yum!) My room on the 25th floor had an amazing view. Our rooms were so clean and well decorated. The bed was very comfortable and made those 15 hours of meetings and walking in heels wash away. We had plenty of towels, which were also replaced everyday and we always came back to a tidy room. I really liked the staff here. Every single person I spoke to was very, very friendly and helpful and never appeared annoyed with us. The gym exceeded my expectations with their up-to-date equipment and clean workout area. The gym is essential to me because grease and fat in those Chicago style pizzas aren't gonna run themselves off my thighs. There's also a nice outdoor pool on the 5th floor. This is a great venue to host events because the rooms we met in were huge and the staff was very accommodating with everything we needed from setup to food. Great location, cheery staff, and clean rooms. All I really ask for. Note: No fridge/microwave and AC doesn't go below 78 degrees. Trade off: there's a bar in the lobby :)",4
647,Beautiful large clean room. Dream bed. Warn chocolate chip cookies upon arrival. Wolfgang Puck coffee. Spa toiletries. Found this room on Hotwire for $77. Normally it would be 200.,5
648,Stayed here for a girls night out in Downtown. It was a pleasant experience. It's nice that there is a Einstein Bagel accessible from the lobby. They also have smoking rooms which are nice for the smokers.,3
649,"Spectacular service and personnel everyone was friendly and accomodating, plus the rates couldn't be beat.",5
650,"Nice property, $89/night on hotwire during a busy period in October.  Room with 2 beds accommodated 5 people (2 adults, 3 young kids) - no problem with the hotwire reservation.  25th floor, nice room, flat screen tv with real HD.  Nice location - walking distance to North Michigan shops or Navy Pier.  We used buses down to the museum campus and up to the zoo - no problems there.  Several breakfast places nearby and tons of restaurants in the area.  Had a nice stay, really positive for the price.",4
651,"This DoubleTree did not let us down, it was exactly to the standard that we expected. We did have a bit of a hard time with the room keys which was annoying but the staff was quick to fix any problems or issues we brought up. The beds are very comfy and the bathroom are large with nice showers. My only gripes were that they have a super-ultra-modern theme and big 'ol tube TVs in the rooms from 1990... it might be time to upgrade, oh and the wifi is $10/per day if you want it in your room, it's only free in the lobby, which was pretty blah if you ask me. Good location though, walking distance to lots of fun stuff, Michigan Ave, Navy Pier, restaurants etc.",4
652,"Mmm great service, and warm chocolate cookies!! mmmm Thank you Doubletree~~~!!!!",5
653,"Yes, the cookies at check-in are nice. The hotel is nice. I thought the room decor was actually better than the W Lakeshore which we had stayed at the week before. Clean. Employees were really friendly and helpful. It sucks that so many hotels make their guest pay for wifi, it's not very hospitable. It is available in the bar area though which is weirdly placed in the lobby. For a decent price I would stay here again and I guess that is all that matters.",4
654,"A decent, reasonably priced hotel.  Nothing particularly fancy, but it was clean and conveniently located near a  bunch of the touristy stuff we went to see.  The beds weren't too comfortable in my opinion, but I like everything fluffy and a billion pillows.",3
655,"This is probably one of the most beautiful Doubletrees that I have stayed at. The staff are some of the most genuinely friendliest people I have ever met. Mad props to Chase, Ben, Antwan, and Rasheed. Also... LOCATION is AWESOOOME! Not too far and not too close from the main streets of downtown. Also close to the Magnificent Mile so if you ever feel like doing some last minute shopping, it's all within walking distance.",5
656,"had some work done at home so temporary stayed at doubletree for a few nights recently for the price, its not bad at all, convenient location, friendly staff, warm cookies, comfortable bed we were unlucky to have a bunch of teenagers next door, they were quite loud and the walls were thin aside from that, no complaints, its not peninsula but hey, i didn't have to pay peninsula prices either",3
657,"As mentioned, great location. Staff was great, cookies are a great touch and a nice room. Also, a small thing, but I do like the Neutrogena products. I was kind of surprised that the nice HD TV offered no HD programs. I also see how the mini bar could create a problem with unknown charges as mentioned. I overheard a lady talking in the restaurant how she must have moved something on the weight-sensitive trays and was charged. I don't know why they have to set it up that way. It should allow for a delay in case something is picked up and examined. Maybe five minutes. I was also a little disappointed that the free breakfast with my Gold status with Hilton was only a continental breakfast and to get anything hot it was an extra $6. The free for Gold members at the Hilton Garden Inn up the street was much better. Nice and hot in the Weber Grill Restaurant. Not a bad stay at all, but didn't blow my socks off. If price dictated I would stay again, but might not if price wasn't a factor.",3
658,"Check in was fine.. I had such a long day, I couldn't wait to take a nice hot shower/bath. I stepped into my room to find a used washcloth in the middle of the entryway. Nasty!  I also found a used napkin in the minibar tray! Gross!!  There isn't a tub, only a shower. Low and behold the hotel gives me a handicap accessible room that has one of those removable shower heads. The shower head is stuck in the lowest position. I hate those removable shower heads, especially if you have to fight with it to stay in place, much less try to keep the shampoo from getting in your eyes. I couldn't get the locking mechanism to stay in place, so I called to ask if they would change my room. She said unfortunately, we are sold out and I will call maintenance to fix the shower head. A half an hour later after 2 trips and 2 men, the shower was finally fixed. The bathroom looked run-down to me.  The mirror was broken and jimmy rigged to the wall; the seal in the shower area was worn and coming off. The floor I was on was pretty noisy and I checked in pretty late, like 11pm. Also, I went to the hotel website to pull the spec sheet, which is right on on the website notes a ""hot breakfast bar"". No such luck!  Know before you go.. no breakfast offered other than room service or the bagel shop downstairs.",2
659,"Fantastic location if you are visiting or working in the downtown area.  I stayed a week in the hotel and never slept better.  I'm a big fan of the Hilton hotels and this was the first Doubletree I've stayed in.  Rooms were spacious and being on floor 17 offered a great view of the city.  The door man was fantastic and the service was great.  There is an Einstein Brothers Bagels downstairs, which was very good.  They are about 2 blocks from 'Magnificent Mile'.  It was a great experience for the money.",5
660,"We went thru Priceline and got a great rate on a Tuesday nite. Room was nice and clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom was adequate and I liked the Neutrogena products. BE AWARE that the mini bar and snacks on top of the fridge are sensor activated so if you even lift something up to look at it, you get charged!!  We did notice in the hallway that a tray of room service food stayed in the same place for approximately 18 hours which I thought was a bit gross. It is within walking distance to many attractions in the area including Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile. Our only problem was finding a place to eat late at night close to the hotel- we were there for the Cubs/Phillies game which went into extra innings, so we didn't get back to the area til about 11:30pm and NOTHING was open - not even TGIFridays or ESPN zone. That info has nothing to do with the review of the hotel,  just general knowledge.  Thank goodness for the chocolate chip cookies we got on arrival, they got us thru the night, even though we were looking for appetizers and a glass of wine............",4
661,"The staff here was friendly and they'll always hand you warm cookies. The rooms are nice, but certainly not fancy. I enjoyed the one night I stayed here. Location is decent.",4
662,"good rooms, great views, cool lobby, friendly staff, good location, good price. only complaint was half of the local tv channels were fuzzy to unwatchable and would it kill ya to put in some flat screens?",3
663,Solid place.  I went there with my brother for a weekend of site seeing and drinking... mostly drinking.  Nothing really going on at the hotel.  Place was nice and the beds were comfortable.  Close to navy pier and michigan ave.,4
664,"I am not kidding...every single person that we encountered at this hotel that worked there from the front desk, to maintenance to housekeeping were so friendly and greeted us with a smile!  That alone to me deserves 5 stars! I am all about great service and this hotel went above and beyond with it for sure! My hubby and I and another couple stayed here for a night on the town visit and we enjoyed our stay for sure!  Our room was clean and well kept!  The location is great.  We usually take the El to the city, and its about a mile from the Clark/Lake blue line station...I suggest you just walk it!  Right by the wonderful shopping on State street and the best part....GARRETTS POPCORN!  They have a flippin' vent to blow out their delicious popcorn smells to lure you in...sneak sneaky..but it works!   The hotel has a decent sized pool...not sure if they have a whirlpool, we did not see one.  The fitness center is nicely sized as well.  The location is right by several restauarants and a short walk/cab ride to even more! Downstairs their is the Viand Restaurant/Bar and there is a Starbucks and a little market for juice, snacks, sodas, etc. If you want to be in a great location with excellent service then this is the hotel for you!",5
665,"So...for this review I decided to wait and see if I was less irritated and my memories of a wonderful night were more blurred by time. Not going to happen apparently. This review should begin with me finding a great deal at this hotel, one within walking distance of an L stop, Navy Pier, and super close to my dinner date destination. I made reservations, gave a credit card number and everything. In preparation for my romantic weekend, I called the hotel to ask about parking and other random questions. I got all the answers I needed from a super helpful desk attendant and gave a rave YELP tip accordingly. Fast forward to the actual weekend. We parked in the adjoining parking garage, no breaks on price even though you're staying with the connected hotel, at 9AM and started our day around town. After trekking our butts around all day, we finally got to the hotel and started to check in. Since this was a surprise for the bf, I was in charge. Let me take this chance to say they checked me in as the wrong person. They took my name, double checked that with my ID and charged my card. They said they'd put a ""hold"" on my card until the next morning when the bill was settled, but online banking and handy text alerts let me know they charged my card 2 minutes after checking me into my room. The odd check-in procedure where they welcomed me back (I'd never stayed there before), tried to have a reservation for one (when there were clearly two of us; I said we were celebrating a late Valentine's for God sake) and looked down right confused when I said I'd only be staying for one night, should have tipped me off, but I was ready to take off my boots and sit the f*ck down. The person it should have tipped off was the desk attendant checking me in. Regardless, they produced two keys for an amazing room. The satisfaction on my bf's face alone was worth the hassle, so far. We got ready for dinner, the concierge called us a cab and we were out for the night. Fast forward to 1AM. The bf and I return from the best steak dinner and drinks we've had in forever, we're a little tipsy and ready to pass out, snuggle style. This hotel uses keys to operate the elevator, safety first, hell ya. So we use our keys and get to our floor. (Note: the keys work). We get to our room and try my key. Doesn't work. Maybe I'm more intoxicated than I thought. Try my bf's. Also doesn't work. Flabbergasted and quickly sobering up, riding down to the lobby. After a bit of chatting with the attendants, we find out there was a mistake and they checked me in as the wrong person so they'd have to CHECK MY ID to give me new keys to the room. Security is one thing, but YOU let me into your hotel, charged MY card and have ALL of my things in your room, which I can't access because of YOUR mistake. A few weird looks from the staff and two new keys later, we were back in our room. They slipped the bill under the door sometime in the morning and apparently that meant we were checked out. Though that was not apparent to me, so I spent 10 minutes waiting in line to check out, only to have them look at me like I had five heads. The bottom line: parking is super expensive (9am Friday to 2pm Sat = $146) and super convenient for the hotel. The hotel is beautiful and has a decent location,  but the customer service leaves something to be desired.",2
666,"Stayed here on my anniversary.  Got a room with a king sized bed on the 17th??? floor. Love the close proximity to the Mag-Mile.  Love the free wi-fi as opposed to the Hilton, which charges you on a timer.   Super clean... control your own A.C.  Modern and with flat screen tv's.  Pull out couch was clean.  Spacious.   This place didn't have a personalized kiosk like other hotels, but it didn't matter because sometimes those kiosks aren't all that helpful anyway.   The only downside was something kind of funny.  The bathrooms don't have a fan.  Haha.   Tell the wifey, to wait it out if you drop a deuce...",4
667,We love our hotel neighbors! The staff is always friendly and great. Come visit Viand and the Courtyard!,5
668,"This is my default hotel property when I visit Chicago.  One block from the Northwestern University Med Center office I do business with, this property works great for me as a business traveler. Around the corner are several good restaurants:  my personal fave for an early dinner, Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBq (3-6 p.m. food and bev happy hour.  Check it out.)  For breakfast, West Egg is just down the street (the huevos rancheros...real live chorizo.  Yum).  Three blocks away is the Purple Pig wine and tapas bar. BUT WAIT... This Courtyard has what no other Courtyard has, in my extensive experience.  Their restaurant, Viand, is really...really...good.  The first time I tried it (out of necessity...sorry Jerry), I was knocked out.  Food was great.  Nicely outfitted beer and wine selection.  Quiet.  Sports playing on the tube.  DUDE!  Breakfast is great too.  The coffee is bold, unlike most ""institutional"" blends.  Last visit, I had the eggs benedict.  Hollandaise was a little citrus-y but didn't detract. This is a great value in my experience.  Plus, the manager, Jerry, writes follow-up emails.  Dig that.",5
669,"First time I have stayed at this location and would return in a heart beat.  The service and the room quality was outstanding.  Neal, the concierge, recommended and great breakfast spot.  A Starbuck's is attached to the location and an Argo Tea shop is right around the corner. Centrally located to all the shopping on Michigan Ave.  Great location.",5
670,"why do i give it five stars, its not a five star hotel but the service, clean comfortable rooms and the location was perfect for me and my family. my room was more like a suite, kids room was smaller. the staff are extremely polite and friendly great place to stay.",5
671,"We picked this place for our one-year wedding anniversary, mainly because we're cheap and wanted to use my husband's points and Gold status to our advantage. I noted in the reservations what we were celebrating because I'm a glutton for free stuff- I can't help it! Everyone loves an anniversary...! Our check-in was smooth and they could not have been friendlier. I wish I remembered the names of the people we worked with, because they hooked us up with a room on the 23rd floor and a lake view, and when we got back from our night out on Friday, we found the front desk staff had sent up a really sweet card and piece of cake, congratulating us. So awesome! The attached Starbucks was super handy, the rooms were small but comfortable and we were central to everywhere we wanted to go- everything was a short walk away. One hiccup to our stay was housekeeping, we were gone Saturday from 10 am- 4:30 pm, and our room wasn't touched. They got us fresh towels as soon as we asked, and it's not like I make my bed at home, so this was a minor issue. Also, they had charged us for parking ($42 a day, W.T.F!!!!) even though we flew down. Whatevs, the cranky Sunday front desk woman eventually took care of the charge... she also messed up our late check out, but since I'm so kind and flexible, it wasn't an issue ;) This place is no frills and not cheap if you don't have points, but it seems reasonable enough for the location.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5
672,"Extremely nice hotel with a great staff! The only drawback and the hotel cannot help this are the constant sirens. There is a hospital nearby so any hotel in the area will have the same problem. The rooms were not as big as I thought they would be but the view was gorgeous. The lobby was really small. For 220.00 a night you would hope for a huge bar, big restaurant and all of that but things were just a little smaller compared to the Marriott down the road. I would recommend the hotel but be weary of the sirens.",4
673,"Was in town for a week for a convention and decided to stay here primarily to build up my Marriot points.  I was very happy with my stay here.  It's very nice to be able to walk a block west and enjoy the Michigan Ave. shopping.  It's also a very short walk from one of my favorite places, Corner Bakery.  The rooms were very spacious (no different from any other big-city downtown Marriott) and the staff was incredibly helpful.  I bought a few groceries at the nearby Whole Foods and realized while I was there that my room did not have a refrigerator.  I called the front desk and they were able place one in my room before I walked back!  Even better, as soon as I walked into the lobby the concierge said, ""Mr. Etim, you'll find the refrigerator you requested next to the television.""  Take a bow. The attached restaurant, Viand, was okay - the eggs and sausage were a little pricy compared to other restaurants a few blocks away.  Will definitely consider this place for a possible vacation stay.",4
674,"Was here from Thursday - Sunday this past week and the service staff were outstanding.  They were very helpful in checking our baggage because we arrived early as well as checking them when we checked out early to travel the town without lugging everything around with us.  Wish we could've had a room that wasn't directly across from the elevator, but that's how things go sometimes, definitely not worth taking a star away.  The hotel was very clean and what little time we did spend in there, it was very comfortable and relaxing.  Great location as well.  Would definitely stay there again.",5
675,"Jerry K. wrote and offered apologies for my bad time at the Marriott. I have great respect for that!  That's class, Jerry!  Thank you for taking the time.",4
676,"We treated ourselves (for a change) to a centrally located hotel in Chicago this past weekend.  We chose the Courtyard Marriott because it is relatively affordable for Chicago and it's known brand name.  They offered a military discount which was great.  We paid for parking (pretty common in the big cities) and chose to self-park, which was entertaining as the garage was extremely tiny! The staff was very nice and helpful.  The room was big and very clean and comfortable.  We had a nice view as we were up pretty high.  It wasn't noisy in the hotel and the beds were heavenly.  Plus, they get an A+ for having curtains that actually close all the way over the windows! My only complaint was that there was no mini fridge, which was a bummer since we had a lot of leftovers we wanted to eat for lunch the next day. All in all, this was a great hotel and in a really perfect location.  A short walk over to Rush, Navy Pier, the river, downtown, and the Red Line.",4
677,I'm a big fan of Courtyard properties for providing top-notch service without being as pricey as say a full service Marriott.  This one ups the ante thanks to their position just off the Magnificent Mile.  Rooms have been recently renovated and they're nice and comfy.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  And free Wi-Fi!,4
678,"Great location for our New Years Eve stay (2 days). Michigan Avenue a 15 second walk away. Navy Pier 3 blocks away. Garrett Popcorn right next door. I even noted a Saki bar across the street. The pool (10th floor) is one of those ""why even have a pool if it is this size""? A Starbucks in the lobby...but I recommend better coffee at half the price at the Dunkin Donuts across the street. Not much of a view in our room (could see a slice of Michigan Avenue). Went with the larger size suite...which worked out well as we had 7 (2 were the grandkids) in the room.",4
679,"Excellent location! And when I mean good I mean good. It is 2 doors down from the very famous very addicting Garrets Popcorn! Staff was very friendly. we stayed over New Years Eve weekend. I think the regular Valet/door man guy was on vacation. The service we got Saturday and Sunday, was not that great. Paid $42.00 dollars a day to park, and they would not go get our car to warm up early, and when we pulled up to the hotel, we never had anyone come out to get our car. But on Monday the day we left, Neil was there, and he was friendly and over eager to help us. So, I think he was on vacation. Hotel was clean, easy to get a round. I would stay there again.",4
680,"When I stayed there, I was surrounded by smoke. I couldn't leave the hotel without a line up of smokers blowing their smoke in my face. They set up a little cafe and the other guests light up next to the door, sitting down and puffing away. I tried to sneak out the starbucks side entrance, and that was next to their official smoking area and eqqually bad. I knew I had to worry about air quality in Chicago, I just didn't know it would be from my hotel!",1
681,"I generally like Marriott properties and this location is no different. When working in Chicago this location is perfectly situated for me.  I have visited the CMMM a few times and hvae usually been pleased, however, my last visit left me a bit disappointed. The a/c in the room was not working and it was unbearably hot. Despite giving maintenance an entire day to sort things out we arrived back to a stifling room on our second night. We managed to get a decent temperature by opening the windows but then had to deal with street sounds all night. I'll give them another chance but if they drop the ball again it will be our last visit.",3
682,"Stayed here for a convention and I walked away very impressed and pleased! The staff is very friendly and professional. The rooms are spacious with comfy beds. My room had two doubles with each bed decorated by five soft pillows each. Tenth floor has an indoor pool, gym room, guest laundry (1$ for each load. Front desk has free detergent and laundry sheets), & microwave. The restaurant, Le Viand, even offers Turducken as a special every once in a while! The hotel is centrally located and just a few blocks from Hancock Tower, Navy Pier, and lots of great food shrines!",5
683,"Such an wonderful location to be staying while visiting Chicago. I had a room that faced Magnificent Mile and it was such a great view to see the architecture at eye level and then look down and people watch. The room was really spacious and open. Shopping is at your fingertips and there are so many good eats around that you need not travel far. If you are looking to venture out a bit, the train is really close or my favorite way to explore a city is just to walk around. Chicago is an extremely walkable city but if that's not your thing then their train system is pretty good too. This Marriott is kind of in the middle of everything with the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave right there you can pick a direction and just go and you'll get somewhere where you want to be. North, South, East, or West point and go. Location means a lot when picking a hotel and this is a great one. The concierge here is so friendly and even funny to boot. Great suggestions whether you give them something to go off of your tastes and likes or not. It's a really busy hotel whether it's late night, early morning, or the middle of the day and you can kind of get lost in the mix but the staff is pretty attentive so even though you may feel like it might happen... it probably won't *Overall You get what you pay for. This hotel is a bit on the expensive side but the staff is as excellent as the location so if you're willing to pay for that then you'll be happy here. Try to get a room on the Mag Mile side for the great view. Rating: 4",4
684,"As always Marriott came correct with the Courtyard Marriott in downtown Chicago! We are relocating there and used points for the weekend and were treated well and there was great service. I had some nice conversations with the good people of Starbucks and the valet guys were a huge help. Strangely enough my parking pass from Indianapolis was working in the garage attached to the hotel so it was free! Otherwise, I think it's a pretty hefty charge and the valets don't accept call ahead requests from the rooms. We were house hunting and so by the evening on Saturday we were dead tired. It was a room service night and the hot wings and cheesecake from Viand totally hit the spot. We're becoming more and more impressed by the Courtyard hotels and this one really was great!",4
685,"I have a personal understanding of the hospitality industry and I know how hard the business really is. This is why I'm super impressed with my stay at this Marriott and plan to write a personal email to the front desk managers to honor some extraordinary staff members of his such as Crystal Kwak and John. My stay at the hotel began with a sour note, due to my flight delay i didnt not arrive until 11pm and came to find out that there is no room at this marriot for me even though I have a confirmed reservation. John, the front desk staff, explained the situation and a room was quickly rebooked for me at James Hotel which is just 1 block away. Without me requesting it, a staff member, Rick, walked with me to James hotel for safety measures. Exhausted from 15+hour of travel, my stay at the James hotel was a pleasant one. The next day, when I ""re-check in"" at the front desk I was greeted with Crystal Kwak, an assistant front desk manager. I told her my name and she had the look immediate that she knew me, she told me how sorry she was to know that I had to get re-booked to another hotel last night and that she's so glad I'm staying here now. Her warmth and sincerity resonated with me and I, too,  was glad to be back in Marrriott. Afterward unpacking my bags, I had a surprise room delivery of a complimentary bottle of Merlot, 2 iced bottled water and a large box of mint chocolate. Needless to say, I went back to Crystal the next day and thanked her personally to make my stay a pleasant one. This hotel has amazing location, close proximity to just about everything, staff is courteous and thoughtful, and this is for an extremely busy hotel that's buzzing all the time (yes even at 11pm!) Which only makes me appreciate all the personal touches even more because it's easy to forget a customer's value in a sea of customers but they didn't do that. I would come back and stay here again and would recommend this hotel for your downtown Chicago stay.",5
686,"Stayed here for a work trip recently. Pros: Friendly employees, great location (one block off of Michigan St.), clean, simple and spacious rooms. Also free WiFi and ethernet cable internet access in the room. One other bonus nice gym and an indoor pool. Cons: I thought it was a little pricey $189 for the quality of the room, but it might have been high because it was a large convention. And their currently under remodel, so weekdays from 9:30 AM on, it's a little noisy. Hopefully you're out and about by then. Overall: If you want a Marriott Hotel close to the Magnificent Mile this place is great.",4
687,"Excellent~ Right at the heart of Chicago Downtown... The best Hotel Rate you can possibly find in the 100 yards of diameter... The quality services is the best feature of the hotel... From the front door~ to the front counter~ From the Concierge~ to the reservation management~ Though they claim themselves to be 4 star rating but, you truly get your money worth as 5 star experience Spring in Chicago is just fabulous~ and claim this cozy place for home, for a week, was the best part of my trip in Chicago!",5
688,"I have been staying at Marriotts for several years, they have one of the best rewards programs (IMO), so many options to choose from to redeem your points - which is why I stick with them.   Luckily the Courtyard was the hotel selection of choice for this conference, it's a great location - only a couple of blocks way from Michigan Ave, nested on the corner.   The rooms are great, have everything you need, wireless and ethernet connections are free and worked very well.  The decor is up to date, the beds are comfy, and the rooms have plenty of space.   The customer service at the front desk was always helpful and courteous.  The bell hop knew his way around town, he was very reliable in telling me where to go and the best way to get there, and what to watch out for.   Drawbacks:   - the pool is small.  It's square, so no Don Draper laps for you - - sorry! - the Biz Center is in the basement, 3 computers there, but one wasn't working - couldn't get online.  At least the printer worked! - the elevators were slooooow.  I was on the 14th floor, but I think one elevator was out (they have 3) and you have to wait forEVA! But overall it was a great experience, I would definitely stay here again.  The Front Door guy is really cool and helpful.",4
689,"A rather forgettable hotel, I'd even forgotten that I stayed here a weekend ago until I was going through receipts. Because of business, I was delayed checking in until 6 AM. (Yes, 6 AM. Yes, business.) At the front desk, I was told that they had cancelled my reservation because I hadn't shown up. I pointed her to my watch and indicated that it was still before check-out time, so I'd please like my room. I also mentioned that I have Platinum status with Marriott. She quickly reinstated my reservation and checked me in. The room was just right for a Courtyard with a view looking west. Oddly, it was two separate windows with one of the support pillars in between. After crashing for a few hours, at 2 PM I took the ""do not disturb"" off the door and headed back to the client. Returning much later, the room had not been done up. I was too tired to complain. The little tent card in the room clearly said that rooms are cleaned until 5 PM. Oh well. Bed? Comfortable. Room? Clean. Bathroom? Clean and stocked properly. Would I stay here again? Probably.",3
690,"Good location with good amenities. Service was very attentitive. Restaurant menu for breakfast a bit boring. The room was nice, 24 th floor in the corner.",4
691,"Ah, it was fine. We were in a scramble and it was a room. We way overpayed for it, though, but the entire city was booked, so I guess that's what happens when you procrastinate. The employees were great, the bed was adequate and at least didn't have that horrible foam comforter thing that you occasionally encounter. Not really much else to say.",3
692,"This is really a very solid property just off the Mag Mile, which means things are quieter.  In fact, I barely heard a sound in my room, and turns out there was a young family in the room next to me with noisy kids (according to them).  Property couldn't be more convenient to many dining choices in Streeterville, River North, and Mag Mile.  If looking for a quick sandwich, Timothy O'Toole's is a below-street sports bar with good burgers and salads, albeit noisy.  Ask the hotel concierge for a 20% coupon.  Multiple convenient Zipcar locations nearby as well. My room was smallish, but very clean and comfortable.  HVAC was quiet and easy to set.  Yelp check in special at Viand next door (enter through hotel lobby) was very nice, and I recommend this place in the evenings for a quiet drink in a nice space.  I also recommend the breakfast buffet in the am next door at Viand.  Great waitstaff and good food, clearly there were a lot of regulars and the employees loved their jobs. Only complaint about the Marriott is that at check out time the wait for an available elevator may take a while.  The hotel is very popular, and for good reason.  Very reasonable prices and a great location make this a very good choice.",4
693,"I walked in off the street and I am only a silver member with Marriott They hooked my son and I up with a room ASAP, i was really impressed, it was so last minute and everything in town was booked up. They could have charged anything they wanted and they gave me a great rate. I have been at the Marriott on the mile and it was not as nice as this place was. Such a good call. I love how close it was to everything. Will be staying there again. The parking was great and desk service was the best. PLUS room service rocked!!!!",5
694,"The room we had was VERY clean and the beds were super comfy. The staff was also very accommodating. We thought our room would have a mini fridge, well it didn't so the front desk was nice enough to bring one up at no additional charges. (Sweet) We had a nice city view. Walking distance to all the stores. Just a quick cab ride away from everything else. My friend dished out the $28 for self park. Though Priceline we paid $87 (After taxes) for a room with 2 double beds.",4
695,Very nice courtyard Marriott located in a very easily accessed area of Downtown Chicago.   The staff was super friendly and the room was clean and very attractive. The hotel itself is attentive to individuals in wheelchairs as my wife is in a chair.  However the beds in the handicap rooms are extremely tall making it difficult for anyone that is wheelchair bound to gain access to the bed by themselves. The onsite parking garage is a nice option and is centrally located making it easy to get around the Michigan Ave. area of Chicago.,4
696,"We LOVE this hotel.  Gorgeous, modern room, the absolutely perfect location in the city.... ended up here by accident when an east coast snowstorm landed us in Chicago and we couldn't be happier.  Free wireless, laundry machines, super friendly staff, what more could you want?  When our flight got cancelled a second time, we had to stay longer and they extended our great rate even though we were now going to be staying over a holiday.  We were, of course, completely won over! But, yes, watch out for the heavenly scent of Garrett's popcorn hitting you right outside... we were fairly obsessed with getting some our entire visit!",5
697,"I found this hotel surprisingly luxurious. Maybe it's because I had been living in a college dorm the past 7 months, maybe it's because I checked in at midnight and was exhausted, maybe it's because I had been having a stressful few weeks, maybe it's because this was my first time staying alone in my own hotel room and I treasured the privacy and freedom. I don't know, but upon entering my room, I felt almost as if I were at the Ritz. No doubt, however: this _is_ a very upscale Courtyard, despite being no pricier than usual. My room and bathroom were spotless and actually glamorous under the incandescence and the city lights, if that makes any sense. In the daytime, the room would look less relaxing. That's okay; I left early in the morning, anyway. Seriously, for $80 (weekend rate) and a free $15 Visa gift card (Marriott promotion), I was completely blown away.",5
698,"Took step-daughter and her friends downtown for a night at Navy Pier, Willis Tower, etc.  Got them a room here adjoining ours - staff was friendly and accommodating.  They asked her name and age, sent up a nice piece of cake, card and drinks with their compliments!  That was very nice, not expected - everything exceeded our expectations, thank you!",5
699,"This is not the average Courtyard. The rooms are pretty typical in terms of layout, cleanliness and quality. The location is in downtown Chicago, so you can get to a ton of restaurants and theaters easily. They do have a full service restaurant and bar, which you normally don't get at the Courtyard. Because they have a restaurant on-site, room service is available. They also have the usual courtyard market and a mini Starbucks.   They also have a doorman.  I really don't like this because I have to tip the guy $1-2 bucks every time I get in or out. He hails a cab for me, but this is downtown Chicago. You walk outside and put out your arm, three taxis show up; pretty much any time of the day.",4
700,"I had my wedding at the Courtyard Marriott and it was great.  The Marriott hasn't done too many weddings so I was really afraid to put my trust in them, but the end result was amazing.  Looking back on my photos just confirms it.  My guests can't believe how great the food was.  We had our ceremony and reception at the Courtyard, the reception was in Viand (the restaurant in the hotel), which is a perfect set up for a smaller wedding.  There is a new events coordinator who came in at the tail end of the planning (mine left with barely any notice- Bride's worse nightmare) but she seems to really ""get it"" and will probably help build their portfolio of weddings. Michelle and Melissa in Sales were great.  The hotel just renovated most, if not all of it's rooms and all of our guests loved it.  They gave us great upgrades as well. The banquet captain, Alfredo definitely worked with us to make the day great which is the key thing to find in a venue. The food again...amazing! One of my guests when they RSVP'd wrote ""best menu option ever"".",5
701,"Excellent choice of hotel in Chicago with courteous staff, spacious rooms, great location, and free wifi and business center (as it should be!) I lived in Chicago for four years and was thrilled with the location.  It is just north of the river - 10 minute walk to Navy Pier, Mag Mile Shopping, and most importantly Gino's East, Frontera, Giordanos, and other great dining spots.  It is walkable down to Millennium Park/ Art Institute  but allow for a good 20 - 30 minutes. The staff was courteous but not in a robotic manner.  Very approachable and if they didn't know the answer, they were happy to look it up.  They also demonstrated empathy.  Came in on a red eye on a very busy weekend (35K people in Chicago for a conference) and they gave us a room right away at 7am without any fuss.   The rooms were standard for any hotel chain - comfy beds, good tv channel selection, etc.  We were fortunate and got a top floor room overlooking the lake and skyscrapers.  If there was one thing I would have liked, it would have been complimentary bottle water to take on the road or to make coffee with in the morning - only because Chicago tap water has a slightly chlorinated taste to it.  Also, the bottles of conditioner and shampoo were on the smaller side - enough for me but my wife needed more. I LOVED the fact they didn't charge for WiFi nor for use of the business center to print boarding tickets, maps, etc. On another occasion, I ate at Viand and it isn't bad - seems to be a popular function spot.  (At the same time though, there are plenty of other great restaurants within close walking distance).   In summary, the courtyard has the best of all worlds: good location, free useful amenities, approachable staff, AND one can actually earn points for a stay.",5
702,"Great location right off the Magnificent Mile. Very comfortable hotel! Staff are great, love the room service options from Viand (restaurant next door). Beds are FIRM, much more so than most Marriott properties (me likie!). I'd definitely stay again.",4
703,"This hotel is fairly new, it's easy to get around everywhere, room is clean, staff is helpful.  Good stay!",4
704,I stayed here once by accident - because I had reserved THIS Courtyard instead of the one on 30 E. Hubbard. The room was fine and the location was fine. I just didn't really like it because it felt like the hotel was in the land that time forgot. Everything just felt old and over startched and not fun.,2
705,"Location, location, location...that's the primary benefit of this hotel.  CMs are pretty standard wherever you go...yes, some better maintained than others.  This one was finishing a renovation but the rooms still looked pretty average.   If you like being near Michigan Ave. and don't want to pay extreme prices but want a decent bed at night and good business travel amenities, this is the place.  2 blocks from Nordstrom, a few blocks from Ginos and right next to the brand new Garretts Popcorn shop with the heavenly caramel aroma. A very small Starbucks off the lobby. The bed is okay, not great, not enough blankets.  Free wireless is great.  Not enough channels on TV (no A&E, no TRUTV); Great bellmen who are very helpful.  You can schedule the cleaning of your room in case you want to go out for the day and don't want to leave your laptop, etc. in the room while it's being serviced.   Do not...I repeat...DO NOT order room service from the restaurant off the lobby called Vivande.  I had the misfortune of ordering dinner from there on SuperBowl Sunday because I wanted to eat  in my room and watch the game.  The salad was old and the soup had these mushy croutons (blegch!).  Eggs over medium were eggs over raw.   The serving staff was apologetic of course but it was a poor compensation for bad cuisine. I would stay there again yes, especially if I knew i wasn't going to spend much time in my room (to go shopping instead!)",3
706,"I've stayed here twice now and would go back in a heartbeat.  If I'm looking to save money in the city and still stay at a central place in a nice clean hotel, this is it.  The rate was great (around $150 I think).  The restaurant next door (Viand) is connected on the inside and you can bill your meal to the room.  They also do a decent breakfast.  It's close enough to go for a run on Lakeshore and close enough to shop on the MM.  Great restaurants are all walk or short cab ride away.  The room was exactly what you expect from Marriott and perhaps a little nice than some Courtyards I've stayed at in non-urban areas. Always check here before you book a room in the city.",4
707,"It's my home away from home.  I stay there on average once a month and it's by far the best run Marriott Property there is.  Convenient, professional and the most congenial staff in the Hospitality industry.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY!!!!",5
708,Loved loved loved the service here and the starbucks downstairs!! Awesome location on the Mag Mile and walking distance from just about all kinds of shopping. I would definitely recommend this as a prime location hot spot!!,5
709,"Think ""upscale Courtyard Marriott"" is an oxymoron? You won't if you stay here. My stay here felt similar to my stays at hotels in Chicago with reputations for being more higher-end. Beds were plush and very comfortable, staff was super friendly and very accomodating, and the lobby was warm and inviting - complete with a fireplace, a giant jar of cookies, a bowl of crisp apples and a dispenser of apple cider. Very convenient location, just a short block off Michigan Avenue. (Though if you are watching your calories, be warned: Getting to Michigan Avenue from this hotel requires passing Garrett's Popcorn; be prepared to be very tempted by the waff of hot caramel!)",4
710,"Great location right off of the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave! Friendly staff, clean rooms, affordable (for downtown Chicago), overall great value...My favorite part was the big comfy King beds. Probably the best night of sleep I ever had outside of my own home! Marriott always does a great job, and this location follows suit wonderfully.",5
711,"I stayed at this hotel tons for business.  I knew the front desk folks by name, and they knew mine, too.  They made an extra effort to make my stays go smoothly (even before I stayed with them often). The Starbucks in the lobby is convenient if not the smoothest running location I've seen.  Remember that Courtyards are for business travel, so there's a concentrated rush in the morning. Viand has to be the best restaurant I've ever seen at a Courtyard.  High quality breakfast foods (sorry, never tried other meals) cooked to order (buffet on weekends I think). The staff are attentive and caring.  If you ask for a dinner recommendation they won't just give you a photocopy sheet like some places (though they do have a brochure)--they'll talk you through what you're in the mood for, and tip you off to newer places if you're into that. This is not a luxury hotel, as CY's are not, but the service is classy! I like that.",5
712,"I just got back from a week long convention at the McCormick Center in Chicago.  I was very satisfied with this choice for a hotel.  I typically stay at Marriott properties when I travel.  This was one of the better Courtyards I have ever stayed at.  The rooms were clean and standard ""Courtyard"" setup with the exception of the beds and linens that seemed brand new.  The bed was really comfortable, rivaling Westin's famed heavenly beds.  The staff was bright and attentive no matter if I was wearing a suit in the AM or crawling back from Rush Street in my jeans and a ball cap at 1:30 in the morning.  Location wise this hotel was perfect.  Shopping and nightlife is right outside the door.  Most other attractions are walking distance or a short cab ride away.  The fitness center is small but clean and functional.  Actually it did have about six (6) treadmills plus free weights et al.  The hotel restaurant, Viand, has a nice bar and half priced wine special on Tuesday nights that is such a value in Chicago it drags in some friendly locals.  I would definitely go back.",4
713,awesome hotel ... very clean and the staff is very nice and friendly .. everyone i encountered had a smile in their face and willing to help.. one of the best hotels i have stayed,5
714,"Pluses: * Flavored water and cookies in the lobby * The spa was on our floor (4th), just down the hall * A great, very firm mattress * Seriously light blocking shade plus drapes * Fluffy robes in the big closet * Starbucks coffee for the coffeemaker in the room * Recycling can and regular trash can NOTE: Spa Ritual was the BEST part of the pluses!!  Manis, pedis, facials, massages, waxing and more in the spa (or in your room!).  Ask for Lisa - the awesome esthetician! Minuses: * Small and lumpy pillows on the beds * No fridge * Low water pressure in the shower * Double shower head was stuck so it wouldn't adjust to just one on (and maybe have stronger pressure) This hotel is close to so many things, that even with the negatives it's a great place to stay!",4
715,"I had a pleasant, albeit short stay at this Westin.  Keeping up with trend of what appears to be a huge amount of hotels that sink money in the lobby but not the rooms, this Westin falls in line.  The lobby is nice - strangely rectangular - but in good condition.  The room was fine - in need of a facelift I think.  My in-room wifi did not work at all. The heavenly bed is reason enough to stay at a Westin.  The staff was very friendly here. For business purposes, I think the Westin Chicago River North is a more convenient location.  This Westin was in a great area though - near beautiful shops and restaurants - perfect for tourists.",3
716,"GREAT location and awesome service.  Close to the best shops and taxi cabs are plentiful. The bad: -rooms are a bit dated for the price I paid -I woke up in the early AM b/c the next room I was next to was partaking in adult activities.  Then I proceeded to listen to the conversation after wards, and not because I'm nosy, but b/c THE WALLS ARE PAPER THIN!",4
717,"First the Hotel's positive attributes: The location is second to none; it's across the street from the Hancock Tower on the northern periphery of the Magnificent Mile and the southern edge of the Gold Coast; it's in the city's shopping district and near landmark destinations; and it's a little over three blocks away from the picturesque western shore of Lake Michigan and has spectacular room views of Michigan Avenue. Where the hotel fails: they try to come across like a boutique hotel, but are really just a Marriott-type hotel in knock off polyester boutique clothing; the walls are tissue paper thin and everything said can be heard; the doors slam even when you try to close them gently; they play sucky pop country music over the sound system; we had problems with our room safe, there was no ""Do Not Disturb"" sign in our room; the shower head, a peculiar, bizarre, and intimidating two-headed device, had loose plumbing, the alarm clock was missing the backup battery, and other parts, our one room service order was screwed up, and a call to the front desk and concierge went unanswered. All of this for a premium price in the toney Gold Coast area. In this case, the positives do not out weigh the negatives, which is surprising since the Westin is part of the Starwood properties. Starwood markets their hotels as modern, urban, efficient, technologically advanced, and for some properties, edgy. The Westin on Michigan Ave is anything but, and that is why they are just okay with three stars.",3
718,"If you're in Chicago for a conference and someone is paying for your room, it's very hard to find things to complain about. If you're paying for this room by yourself, then I'm sure you'll find more to complain about.   As far as the room being bland and boring...it's a hotel room.  Most of them are.  If there were dancing monkeys in every hotel room throughout the world and one didn't have a dancing monkey, then I'd be disappointed.  (no monkeys were harmed in the writing of this review, by the way). I also chose the green option and do not see the points...so shame on them. Some staff was very friendly and helpful, while others didn't know which way was up.  This did not make my boss happy. I didn't get any other food but if you are expecting a full Starbucks in the lobby, you're going to be disappointed.  It is severely lacking in options as well as hours open, but it does have the choice of cold cereal with milk if you are looking after your carb consumption. For some reason, my room and/or alarm clock was haunted as it kept going off EVERY NIGHT at different times.  Don't they check that to make sure it's off when they turn over the room- especially since many people nowadays (such as myself) use their phones as their alarm clock? The location to the John Hancock building can't be beat.  Sadly, many other things can. Not bad, but not the best I've had.",3
719,I've stayed here two times.  First time I would give them a 5 star rating.  Second time I would give them a 1 star rating.  So I guess that averages out to 3???   I won't go into too many details about either trip.  Just know that the first time we went we were treated very well and made to feel welcomed.  The second time our needs were ignored and we didn't feel that warm feeling we did the first trip.   I've stayed at many Westins and I can say this place is inconsistant at best.  Good luck.,3
720,"Westin bed = darn fine Wait Staff = darn fine Nice location, room view was what one should expect: Of another building across the way. No problems with noise in the room like other reviewers. Else = Left something to be desired. The wifi wasn't too bad, but what REALLY got my goat?  No wired internet. Says there is but no.  There's a cable *on the desk* in the room, which I followed back (as an ex-IT guy I like to tinker) where it goes to a box and then nothing, nada, no other cable.  Lovely ruse, Starwood, thanks. Ha-ha! What a lark. I called the desk and the fellow a little too nonchalantly said ""Well have you tried the Wifi instead?"" Does something smell funny or is that the Chicago River? Stayed there for a medical conference of the g-friend's, she said her boss's boss professed they were very unhappy with the measly catering provided for what they thought was an exorbitant price. Room service charges were INSANE. $5 + 11% tax (ok, that's fine) plus 24% *service charge*!?  We had our meals paid for top to bottom, ate at some nicer places while down there, but even in a pinch we refused to pay such inflated rates. The prices at the bar downstairs were just plain over the top, too.  It cost me $19 for a beer and a shot, just a Goose Island 312 and a Ri rye. Never again. Not ever, ever, ever, ever. I would stay there again on someone else's tab or in a pinch, since it was comfy enough and we had a nice time, but the amenities and prices just didn't add up for us.",2
721,"We recently held an event here. The hotel is great, and the staff very helpful.There was a bit of a disconnect between the sales office and the front desk, but they figured it out quickly. If you every need an embarrassingly large, nicely appointed suite, get the presidential suite. I'd live in Chicago, if I could live in that suite.",4
722,"For a Westin, I was expecting more. I thought the interiors and bathrooms were lacking, and their toiletries aren't anything special. The written instructions for their eco program to skip housekeeping, and return the card are unclear. Perhaps I should've known to keep my card, and give it to the front desk rep when checking out. I interpreted it as giving several options, one of which to drop off in the room card box. Calling the Michigan Westin after my stay to request Starwood points didn't work since I didn't comply with the instructions. No Starwood points for this guest. I think there are nicer hotels to stay at in Chicago like the Palomar or W, than this Westin without sacrificing much for location.",2
723,"Motel 6 quality at Hyatt prices. This Westin has the worst rooms I've ever experienced in a Westin.  The bedding hasn't been replaced in 5 years and is beat to heck, the rooms are Tokyo-tiny, and half the rooms in the hotel seem to be located behind the elevator.  Sound insulation is also nonexistant.  I don't think I got more than 4 hours of sleep any of the 3 nights I was there. Overall, I get the sense that this Westin is around a decade past a need for a general upgrade. The only reasons they get two stars are: the staff was extremely nice and personable, and the conference facilities and catering are quite good.   Overall: attend a conference at the Westin, just don't sleep there.",2
724,"This is a very nice hotel on the Mag Mile. The nearby shopping and dining is great, and the hotel staff is very attentive. I found it interesting that place actively uses their green program. For every night I went without having my room cleaned I got either $5 off food or 500 hotel points. If you are a frequent traveler like me the points are worth it. They can be used at Sheraton hotels as well. I've stayed at the Palmer Hilton nearby, and that's a much nicer hotel for not much more. This Westin is nice, and it gets the job done. Caution, the restaurant bar has overpriced food, but it's good food.",4
725,"Location, location, location, this place has it.  Right across the street form the John Hancock tower and right on the magnificent mile.  An ideal location if your looking to shop! The actual rooms were pretty average, nothing to rave about; stayed in a 2 queen bed room. The door knob on the bathroom door actually came off, so we'd have to be very careful using the door or we'd pull off the knob every time.  The rooms didn't look old, but not new either. When we checked in late at night there was no one at the desk to help us.  We waited for a quite a while, we were all pretty exhausted from a long flight and just wanted to sleep, not very pleasant. I just give this hotel an avg rating, if not for the location I would have downgraded the place to a 2 star rating.  Oh and the price wasn't horrendous either, we had a 3 night for the price of 2 deal through spg which made it bearable.",3
726,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference this past weekend and was not impressed. In the interest of full disclosure, I just came back from a trip to Asia where I also stayed at three Starwood hotels (Sheraton Hong Kong, Sheraton Taipei, Le Meridien Taipei), all of which were far more superb, which may explain why I'm negatively biased in this case. First, the rooms are clean but BORING. White shower curtains, white sheets/comforter, and very bare walls. Two, there is a Starbucks downstairs which on their website says is open at 6AM, but no one was there when I went downstairs the first morning of my stay to grab coffee at 6:05AM. When I asked the concierge, he responded that it would be open shortly. A few minutes later, I see an employee hurry in preparing to open. When I asked her when they would be ready, she responded that they open at 7AM. WTF. Third, the hotel offers a ""green choice"" program where you receive either 500 Starwood points or a $5 voucher if you choose not to have your sheets/towels replaced for a day. I opted for this offer but didn't receiver EITHER points or a voucher when I checked out. Fourth, the room service charges are ABSURD:""$5 delivery charge, 24% service charge, and 11% sales tax."" Despite having the luxury to expense my meals during my stay, I refuse to pay for such a rip-off.",2
727,"This was the absolute worst hotel experience I have ever had in my entire life. I was in town with friends for a bachelorette party and arrived at the hotel at 1245pm. They said our room wouldn't be ready until 3 (completely understandable) so we asked if we could drop off our bags. The bellboy told us to ""drop our stuff and not touch it"" because he thought it was disorganized and didn't want us helping him put it up - okay, that's fine. We went and had lunch and came back at 3pm and were told the person in our room was staying until 5pm. I asked if another room was available and he said he would call my cell to get us one as soon as possible. At 6pm there was still NO ROOM and NO CALL. Eventually I tracked down a manager and she said she would get us a room soon. At 720pm I we were able to put our bags in the room, but were late to our 7pm dinner, not to mention unshowered after a 6 hour drive and had to change clothes in the soon-to-be bride's room since ours wasn't ready. We were given NO discount even though our room was 4+ hours late. It was a horrible experience, every person I talked to was unfriendly and was not able to help, and it put a damper on what was suppose to be a special night. I have not heard from management despite trying to contact them. I will NEVER stay in a Westin again and will alert all my friends and family to never stay there as well. Simply unacceptable for a huge pricetag.",1
728,"stayed at the Westin on N. Michigan Avenue during Memorial Day Weekend. First off, we landed in O'Hare and took the subway to the hotel. After switching trains in downtown Chicago and walking 6 blocks we finally arrived at the hotel. There are only two things going for the Westin on Michigan Ave, it's location to shopping and the Westin Heavenly Bed. One of which you could get at another Westin or Starwoods property and the other via taxi. Check in was quick and since I am a ""preferred Starwoods Member"" I was told I was upgraded to a higher floor reserved for ""preferred members"". The room did not appear to be ""preferred"". It was directly behind the service elevators and I could hear the elevators operating all day and night. Luckily I brought ear plugs to wear while sleeping otherwise I would have gotten no sleep. Additionally, the rooms themselves are not quiet. You could hear anyone and everyone in the hallways (and there were lots of unruly screaming children running down the halls too). The room itself was on the smaller side, a king size bed, two night stands, a bureau with TV on top, desk and soft chair with ottoman. My one complaint about the furniture, which I don't usually comment on, was that there were not drawers on the nightstands only doors that opened to the space below. Additionally, there were no drawers in the desk either. The only drawers in the room were the 4 small drawers in the bureau under the TV. The other part of the bureau housed the refrigerator with stocked overpriced items. The bathroom was standard for a hotel room and appeared clean although the housekeeping staff never gave us an extra towel or soap or shampoo. Being a preferred member I also got free Wi-fi access, however, the wi-fi here was pathetic. I had faster service on my 3G phone than the wifi, it was a worthless benefit. A big beef I have with hotels is that the beds are not completely made. After sleeping in the bed once I once again found that the sheets did not reach the bottom of the bed and the mattress and the small mattress pad were exposed. I had to pull off all the sheets and covers so that the staff would correct it. Additionally, the Westin usually gives you extra pillows in the room, this Westin did not, however, housekeeping did provide us with a few extra pillows. Westin offers a workout facility in each of their hotels. I've been to some really nice hotel facilities and some not-so nice ones, this hotel ranks in the middle. They did provide dumbbells but had no cable machine and 4 plate type machines. There were also a couple of aerobic machines (treadmill/ellipticals) but not many. Our room did not have a view either. We overlooked another building across the way. As I stated in the beginning, the Westin Heavenly bed was the only plus to our visit. Would be stay here again? No, while we like Starwood properties, we would try another first. When you pay more money for a Starwood property, you expect higher service and quality. This property did not deliver.",2
729,"We stayed at the downtown Chicago Westin Hotel this weekend and had a great experience! The weekend price was very reasonable, rooms were average as far as decorating goes, but they had really great beds and bedding. My son needed emergency cleaning service on his suit and, voila! It was hanging in his room within a short time. The lobby is small but had plenty of seating-it gave the feel of a boutique hotel. Even though there was a coffee pot in the room with Starbucks coffee, we took advantage of the lobby Starbucks. The grill/bar had a warm old Chicago ambiance-great photos filled the walls and the light fixtures added to the flavor of the room.",4
730,"Stayed at Westin Michigan Avenue on my recent visit to Chicago. This hotel is decent, but certainly not great. It is conveniently located on Michigan and Delaware. Right in the Magnificent Mile area and across the street from the John Hancock Center. In terms of location the hotel is great. However, I felt that the hotel was a little dated. It is not as nice as other Westin locations I have visited. Our room did not even have the dual shower heads which Westin is known for. I was also a little disappointed in the service. We had arrived late Friday night and they only had one person working the front desk. Being a SPG Gold Preferred Guest I stood in the line designated for such members. However, the employee working the front desk decided to help other guests prior to me. I'm not even complaining about not getting preferential treatment. They walked in after me. We he finally decided to help me, he wasn't every enthusiastic about his job. Once checked in the employee did not even properly direct me to my room. I had to go back and ask where the elevators were. That's not the way to treat a customer, especially a loyal one! My stay wasn't all that bad. I'd say my initial interaction at checkin is the basis for my rating.",3
731,"Ditto the other Yelpers about great location, nice service & rooms needing a Ctrl+Alt+Del.  The view from my 17th floor room was really beautiful, though, so ask if you can score a Michigan Ave. facing room. The fitness center was better equipped than I would have expected, judging from the otherwise older, outdated hotel.  Medicine balls, swiss balls, yoga mats, walls of mirrors, lots of cardio machines, all pretty new. If you're looking for a Miracle Mile hotel and this Westin comes up pricing less than expected for other hotels in the same class, now you know why.  So, if it's a luxe experience you seek, keep looking; but if you want a nice, standard Westin with a killer location, you'll be happy here.",3
732,"The beds are comfortable and the location is fantastic! The bar on the main level is a nice spot for a cold one. It is a Westin, and it acts like a Westin.",4
733,"Overall rating - 3 stars Stayed over a long weekend Location - Excellent.  Easy walk to shops or public transit. Room - Clean, quiet.  We were on an upper floor with a lake view.  Standard hotel room setup.  Nothing fancy. Food - n/a",3
734,I was only there for a one day conference so I can not review the rooms themselves.   The Valet parking was a nice touch and once inside the hotel it was easy to find which room I was suppose to be in because of the signage pointing me there. A good experience for the day that I was there.,3
735,"This hotel has a great location but the rooms have a subpar ambiance.  Clean (despite the mold in the shower), worn out furniture, terrible view, but conveniently located. Good if you don't spend a lot of time in your room and you get a deal on Hotwire. Also very close walking distance to Oak Street Beach. We were allowed to check in early (9:00 am) on a Friday, so that's a definite plus. Call the night before to see if that's possible. 3 stars because of its location and price, despite its flaws.",3
736,"We went to this hotel, primarily for it's locale...we were taking our daughter for a special birthday weekend, to the American Girl store (which is just 2 blocks down the street from the hotel) and then to Shedd Aquarium. Unfortunately, we didn't get to the Aquarium...:( In a nutshell, the room next to us was ""rented"" to a younger couple that used it for party central. In and out, people in and out, laughing, hollering, smoking in the room and in the hall . The smoke crept in, under the ajoining door and was quite strong smelling in our room. The worst of it was the ""relations"" that the couple were in engaged in. For over an hour, 1am-2:15am or so, we were regaled with the happy couple's ""fun"". We thought we were granted a reprieve after that...but no...THEN they were hungry and THEN they decided they wanted to make some calls on their respective cell phones...loudly. As other posters have said, the walls must have zippo for insulation, I could hear people opening a soda down the hall for goodness sake. Calls to the front desk and operator to complain went unanswered (did we catch someone on a break? was there a party? were they in the room next to ours, perhaps???). At 4am, with no hope of sleep and a strong thunderstorm overhead, we gave up....packed up and checked out. Only then were able to voice our frustration to someone at the hotel. He expressed sympathy and asked us if we wanted to speak to a manager. We said yes and then after a few minutes, with a manager a no-show, we opted to leave. They compted us our parking, which was helpful, but ya, in the grand scheme of things, it's a drop in the bucket. As the other Yelpers have mentioned, service charge for room service is whacka-doodle and we were to get free Wi-Fi for being ""preferred members"" which we did not. All in all, not something we'll want to re-visit.",1
737,"PROS: 1)The rooms were clean. 2) when we asked for extra shampoos they were delivered right away. 3) The building is in an awesome location. 4) You could leave your bags in the hotel after you checked out and get them at the end of the day. CONS: 1) Check in/ Check out line is huuuge. 2) Lobby is not the best. Overall, definitely recommended to friends!",4
738,"The hotel is very clean and the rooms are comfy. The best part is the location. You are in the heart of downtown and you have the Hancock building next door and the view from our room down Michigan Avenue was plain gorgeous. Also, you can walk to Rush Street to have some food and drinks. The bad part is that they don't have free parking, no free WIFI and the worst they don't have a swimming pool or a jacuzzi. This is a very expensive hotel so I cannot believe they don't have a pool.... I have been in way cheaper hotels that have those amenities so it doesn't make sense for such a nice hotel don't have it. Service on the front desk wasn't the best either. I was standing there for more than five minutes waiting to check in and then we went to check out their system were down so we couldn't get our receipt at that time. Overall, not what I was expecting from the Westin or for the room price.",2
739,"Spontaneity is my middle name. Ok.  I lied.  But I very recently had a spur of the moment getaway that was brief, yet very delightful.   The room was hot.  Like whew-eeeeee!!  I tried cranking the a/c but it didn't seem to come on.  Just a little stream of air.  Ugh.   Everything else was great.   The room was super clean.  Carpet was spotless.  And the bathroom...I could have lived in there!  It was all marbley and sparkley.   How do hotels fold the sheets to make it look picture perfect I will never know, but I love that look.  Maybe I'll practice on my bed at home.   The hotel boasts a prime Michigan Ave location which probably attracts a lot of business travelers and tourists.  I'd prefer to stay at a smaller boutique hotel off the beaten path, but it was very quiet and the bed was dream worthy, so no complaints there.",4
740,"My girlfriend got married here over the weekend. It was absolutely beautiful. Apparently, this Westin is one of the few places in the city that can accommodate a wedding of 350 guests. Every detail was well executed and the ballroom was exquisite. I spent the morning of the wedding day in the bridal suite. It is an older hotel and you can tell, but it still has fantastic views and luxurious amenities. They also have the very comfortable Westin beds! The stair way was beautifully decorated for photographs. Everyone at the hotel was awesome. As for the food, the salmon was dry, but my date's filet was very good. I'd definitely recommend the Westin for a large wedding!",4
741,"We stay here 90% of the time while in Chicago.   *It's an excellent location that is a $15 cab ride from just about everything *Good bar *Nice food in the bar...chicken pot pie! *Great beds *Clean lobby *Updated look to the rooms *Solid workout room *Attentive staff As long as it's under $300 per night, the Westin is an excellent value. And I got some!",5
742,"This place was awful and I do not intend to go back even if the company is paying for it. If you sign up for a package and misread the fine print and don't ask a question and they stick you with a charge, that's your fault. However I called down to the front desk and asked them specifically if my room (rate schedule in hotel speak) covered Internet charges. They said yes on Friday, but when I checked out on Monday I was pleasantly surprised with several internet charges that they're not taking off. Also - if you're expecting to sleep soundly til say 9, you'll be awakened by the sounds of their maintenance and renovation crews drilling things into the wall or dropping things on the ground. Which is something they don't tell you about when you check in.   Yes the beds are comfortable but there's another Westin on River North that's really easily accessible. Or there's about a dozen other hotels that you can pick from along the Magnificent Mile. Don't stay here. If you have a reservation, cancel it. Tell them I told you to. You'll end up paying way too much to be disappointed.",1
743,"During the second part of our stay in Chicago we elected to stay at the Westin instead of going back to Hotel Felix - it wasn't a good decision. Service upon checking in was not welcoming nor helpful. Two bell hops had more interest in cracking jokes among themselves than assisting us with the check in process. Once we did check in and went to our room, it was nice but in need of a renovation. The lighting in the room makes everything look jaundiced. In our particular case, there was an annoying, loud fan blowing which could only be turned off by calling maintenance, which I did 3 times, with a fourth stop at the front desk before the matter was resolved. Internet service was not free and the connection was not good, lessening the feeling that this particular Westin had any interest in offering value or service to us as patrons.",2
744,"This Westin is great! We went during Taste of Chicago and it was the most inexpensive hotel I could find on/near the Magnificent Mile ... considering the location and amenities offered I think it's an excellent value. Yes, it's somewhat sterile in terms of decor because there's nothing trendy or flashy about it... they focus more on form than function with their comfy beds, dual shower head, etc. Service was very friendly (friendly than the Hard Rock!) and I highly recommend it.",4
745,"So much for 30 days of Yelping. If I do three today though, it'll bring my average back up! Onwards! Nice place (seemed to be under renovation), but our room was weird. The toilet kept making noise and the shower wasn't working all that great. It seems like the water pressure was totally off. Usually that's not a big deal, if it's a $75 a night room...not a $275 a night room. Side note, Yelp! - I think the 'business tips' should be adjusted to reflect a hotel, not a restaurant  ;-)",3
746,"What an amazing location!  Wow!  This place is great, the staff is awesome.  I stay here every time I come to Chicago.  Walking distance to Due's!",5
747,"Perfect location if you're gonna stay in Chicago - you've got views of everything important. Oh, and ... MOST COMFORTABLE HOTEL BEDS EVER.  Perfect for that... anniversary ;)",5
748,"I love staying here whenever I come to Chicago. The service is great, the rooms are fabulous and I have never had a bad experience. We got a room at the last minute after hating our room at the Omni hotel down the street. They were able to get us two adjoining rooms, one for my parents and one for my brother and I to share. The rooms were spotless, the beds were fabulous and the staff was fantastic. Plus, it is a dog friendly hotel! How great is that? We had breakfast in the morning downstairs and were regulars at the bar in the lobby! Can't wait to go back soon!",5
749,"Is it time to roll out the red carpet just yet? Perhaps. I stayed here about a month ago with my boyfriend and I must say that I enjoyed myself. The rooms were big and very modern. I'm a stiffler for bathrooms and I absolutely must say that I'd probably eat off the floors of these bathrooms than the plate of some Chicago restaurants. The beds are big and comfortable with white linen and comforters. I, personally, prefer sheets with a little more pizzaz but it's a subliminal thing: white equates with cleanliness. So, I get what they were going for. I was very pleased with the cleaning services as well. I requested my sheets get changed at the end of the night -- because, of course, the beau and I dirtied em up acting like 12 years olds, jumping around like fools -- and it happened rather quickly. The cleaning lady even engaged in a nice conversation with me as she cleaned. Very pleasant. I thought we had a great view and I was quite sad we had to leave and venture out into the real world. I'd love to have known more about the extra amenities of the hotel, such as the gym. And, it'd be awesome if they could toss a couple of iPod radio docks in there for those who just want to enjoy the view and listen to some tunes. Oh, and we didn't enjoy that you had to pay for wi-fi. Seriously? All-in-all please do check the place out. Loved it.",4
750,"Like the previous reviewer, I too was here for a one day conference.  I am giving it a 3 only because I did not stay in a room.  It seemed like a nice hotel with a good location.  We were on floor 16 in a conference room all day.  It was a bright room, with decent views.  The room had a lot of very nice things set up for us, including soda, coffee, and tee service, mints, pens, and paper.  The chairs were comfortable, which is important for all day meetings like this.  They also served lunch, which I thought was great.  Caesar and caprese salad, sandwiches, and soup.  The server was friendly, and they kept everything clean.",3
751,"If you are visiting Chicago and planning to do some damage on the credit card, this is the place to stay. Located at the northern end of Magnificent Mile, this is a great place to start off your day of shopping (I even went back to drop off purchases because I only got about a block away). Plus any touristy location you'll want to visit is within walking distance from here (Navy Pier, Art Institute of Chicago, Millennium Park, etc). The hotel itself looks newly remodeled and clean. The staff was friendly for the most part but didn't care that we were Starwood Preferred and told us to go to the back of the line when we were checking in. Other than that person, everyone else was courteous and helpful. The rooms were on the small side but that's to be expected due to its location. I didn't have time to enjoy the amenities or try the restaurant, which looked like a popular choice for tourists.",4
752,"Great location..right across the street from a funky looking Cheesecake Factory.   Parking: Overpriced..try parking elsewhere or don't bother renting a car if you're staying in the central vicinity.  When it's nice outside, the walk around that area is nice. Rooms: Bed are comfy but I agree with other yelpers that they need some refurbishing.  Could be more updated for the price you pay.  Friendly staff and front desk.  Concierge gave us some passes for local nightlife around the area and the suggested places were fun.  Although the crowd was a bit random, I would still go back. Location: Prime location with lots of things nearby and local transportation.  Near many of the shops and a quick 15 minute walk to Garrett's Popcorn.  What can I say...a definitely PLUS!",4
753,"I'd really give this 3.5 stars if I could.  It was a little better than ""OK"". I'm kind of conflicted with this place.  The location is awesome.  Seriously.  There are plenty of places to eat and shop within a 15 min walk.  The area is very posh and clean - it's the Magnificent Mile for goodness sake! However, a few things kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  Some of them are things that the Westin could improve, others are just things you'd find anywhere in downtown Chicago and I should learn to deal with. First of all, forget self-parking unless you want to park at the Hancock across the street - even then I think you'll pay ~$40/day.   Parking at the Westin is $53/day.  I thought San Francisco was bad at $30 ish/day.  Oh well, that's part of staying downtown and it's not like the Westin is the only one price gouging.  OK, I'll move on. The rooms were small and boring - far too clinical for my taste.  Boring white walls, etc. The beds are awesome - that comes with the territory when you're dealing with Westin or the W. My bathroom had a faulty toilet. There was a TON of mold/mildew built up in the corners of the tub (both outside and inside).  What's disturbing is that they just tried to rub caulking over it rather than actually fix the problem.  I meant to take pictures and forgot.  However, feel free to visit room 949 and you'll get to enjoy it as well.  :p Wireless internet access is pretty awful (when you can get it to work).  It sucks being tethered to the desk but I had no choice most of the time. Room service prices were STUPID. Example: Small Cobb Salad and bowl of soup w/ glass of water.  $40.  WTF?  $5 delivery charge, 5% service charge, etc. They charged me double for parking on one of the days - that's $106 folks!  They fixed it of course. The front desk personnel are great - no issues with them at all.  I really liked the servers at The Grill (during breakfast).  They pretty much rocked and actually had a personality. So, if this Westin was in a worse location, I'd never return.  However, it is in a great location and they do run specials from time to time.  I just can't help but think that there might be better options out there for the money.",3
754,"If the customer service here is as great as typical Westin Starwood properties, I would have kicked in one more star.  However, the mediocre service is a let down for this hotel that has a lot more potential. Pros: -It is at a GREAT location, next to Macy's Water Tower, in the heart of Michigan Ave -Sometimes they have promos in the lobby like free massages or free beverages -The lobby is very well decorated and has a very nice classy feel to it -Rooms are nice and clean, though on the smaller end -The gym has new machines and is well ventilated with dim mood lighting Cons: -netural, uninterested staff who look like they are forced to be there and is waiting for their shift to be over",3
755,"I really do like the Westin more than other business class hotels. The heavenly beds are fantastic, but they really need to figure out the heavenly shower thing. It's not that heavenly or different from other hotels. This hotel in particular was great! It has a prime location on Michegan Avenue, next to the John Hancock building. The only thing that I might complain about was the noise from the elevators (try to get a room away from them), but I won't dwell on that, because the staff was fantastic. They were very helpful and supportive during a very bizarre incident that involved my husband losing his mobile phone on the street and the attempted extortion from the crackheads that found it. The staff performed outstandingly, and, for that reason, I would stay here again.",4
756,"At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. I think in general Westins are the best value for your dollar. The Westin Michigan Ave is no different. Its a solid hotel. If you enjoy your heavanly beds and showers, this is a good hotel for you. Be advised though, this hotel has some of the same problems many older hotels have in Chicago. While this property has definately gone through a facelift to renovate both the public spaces and the rooms, you still have some rooms that are very oversized and not furnished with enough furniture. Our room was no exception. However, they attempted to fill the space by marketing it as a Westin Workout room with a stationary bike and some workout equipment in the room. Overall, this hotel is pretty good. Its not as nice as a the four seasons but not as bad as the Palmer House Hilton.",4
757,"Worn rooms, almost no water pressure, beds had very little life left in their springs, friendly service but slow check-in. Not what I would expect from a hotel this address.",2
758,Stayed here once...  This is a great location...  Right on Michigan Ave just north of the hancock.  Can't beat that... I liked everything about the hotel except the room size...  Just a bit cramped but that is to be expected in downtown Chicago.  I have seen far worst too in NYC (the W hotel-tuscany for instance) and you will pay double for that space! I would imagine this is a great place for business along with personal ventures alike.,4
759,"This place is rude and has the most horrible service I have ever seen. At several hundred dollars a night, I shouldn't be accosted by their impressively trained 'security' staff. This very unpleasant fat woman that was working there yelled at me and followed me around for a good 20 minutes. Even though I was all 'you know, i'm like paying to stay here and just trying to get to my room"" she was all ""oh what room are you staying in what room are you in who you be who you be blah blah blah"" It wasn't even late, it was like 9:00.   Management is not helpful and unresponsive.  This place SUCKS. Stay at the Drake.... P.S. The bar is fantastic... everyone's nice in there!",2
760,"I had been here before years ago and was only here for one night this trip.  Back to my usual how can you screw up one night. The hotel and location are great.  Of course love the heavenly beds.  I had a very nice room on the Starwood Preferred Guest Floor.  They had coffee on the floor in the lobby area in the AM, would be nice if they threw in some snacks too. My view was of the building next door so that was less than to be desired, but my room was spacious and recently renovated. The dual shower head was nice as well as the toiletries. The place was pretty crowded since there was a convention of sorts in town, I didn't get a chance to check out the facilities because my trip was packed and very short. My only question is why do the stores in the Bloomingdale's' shopping center close soooooo early.  I went over there a little after 7pm and it was a ghost town (nothing against the hotel)  - just a note for people visiting expecting to get a good shopping experience in.  In fact most of the stores nearby looked closed.  A bummer because sometimes after a long day of meetings you need some retail therapy.",4
761,"I'd call this hotel a WINO (Westin in Name Only).  Every Westin I've ever stayed in anywhere has been a clear cut above this poser, but it seems Starwood gets to call this a Westin because of the spectacular, unbeatable location.  And that's the only reason to stay here: Location, the best in the city. Lobby and staff are okay.  My issue was the shabby rooms, uninspired and needing renovation.  While the bed is still ""the bed"" -- truly wonderful -- the rooms at this Westin feel like a mid-tier chain (Ramada, Holiday Inn).  And beware, light sleepers: These rooms are loud.  I vividly heard all hallway activity inside my room as if it were being piped in by speaker.  As I feared, hallway noise (door slamming, in particular) jolted me awake three times, and I woke up feeling lousy. The TV doesn't have a channel guide, so you have to turn to each channel to see what's on.  Like some other Yelpers, I too got locked out during my stay, trying to negotiate their 1990 door fixtures and locking system.   It's all about location in Chicago, and this one can't be beat.  But sadly and surprisingly, Starwood has allowed this hotel to deteriorate.  Even an average Westin at this location would be incredible -- I hope they pull it together because today, this hotel aspires to average.",2
762,"I was in a wedding at the 4 seasons last weekend.  We stayed here because even at $200-$300 a night its cheaper than the 4 seasons! This hotel is very convenient, very clean, very serviceable and very forgettable.  The hotel bar is average, and the room decorations were so dull.  I mean, white linens and 2 black and white photos?  And no flat screen?  Strange. I also found the lines at check in to be long and annoying each time i needed something. That being said, there are beautiful flower arrangements and the seating in the lobby is generous and well appointed.  They should have hired the lobby decorator to do the rooms as well!",3
763,"5 star location!!!! 3 star accomodations -rooms need to be updated and not everything was working in my room on this visit. I always base part of my experience on whether the room really calls to me to stay in and relax...this place doesnt do that. BUT the location of the hotel is stellar. Theres no better location in terms of being 1/2 block away from Michigan ave and close to all the shops. So, you pay for the location which will keep you out of the room so you wont mind the room if thats the case.  ;)",3
764,"My stay here this past Sunday and Monday night was o.k.  Nothing special, but nothing totally awful either.  The room was a decent size, the bed was great, but the toilet ran constantly and the bathroom had very few amenities.  Once again, I was cursed with the room by the elevator (I'm 4-4) and while I'm on the subject, I think the elevator had a ghost as it would open & close 2-3 times EVERY ride (regardless of which car I was in) before going up/down. I'm not sure if I'd stay here again.",3
765,"The best hotel stay I have ever had.  A whole lot of bang for very little buck.  I mean, it's the price of every other Westin, only this one is right off of Lakeshore - so minutes away from fun in the sun.  It's right across the street from the Hancock center.  It's on the same street as ALL the amazing shopping any obsessed shopper (like me) would ever want.  AMAZING LOCATION!  It's right in the middle of everything.  I loved it! When I first walked in - it was like no other Westin.  The lobby is long and beautiful.  The room was nothing extravagant but still nice.  And the beds were perfect.  We had a great view of that little courtyard area in front of the Hancock center.  I loved that they had a gym - so my gym schedule wasn't interrupted.  The staff was very informative of the happenings around town.  Especially with the nightlife!  I will DEFINATELY stay here again when I come back to the Chi :)",5
766,"I arrived 10:30pm last night to the Westin.  The beds were super comfortable and indeed heavenly.   The restaurant downstairs (aka ""The Grill"") is a bit generic as you would expect from a hotel restaurant.  I ordered the 18oz new york strip and it was tough!  For $80 (1 steak + drinks) I expected a much better experience.",3
767,"Two stars may be a stretch. I live down the street, but my company was having a sales contest where  you could stay at the hotel for two nights if you won. So, the room was a sauna and we had to sleep with the window open each night. It gets two starts b/c the front desk was nice enough to give me an upgrade with a killer view of the lake. I was excited to use the Reebok Gym. For those who are not gym rats, these are great gym with TVs built into bikes, treadmills, etc. they have it all.  I went down around 6:30 and there was no water! I called and they said they would send it up. No biggie. I get on the exercise bike and there is only one that has straps. For those who bike, you know you need the straps, so I use the one with the straps and the TV does not work. I check the one next to it and the TV does work. I swap the straps. Start riding and there are only two channels. An hour into my work out and still no water. I called again and they said it would be right up. After 1.5 hours and no water I called it a day.   That night, I called the front desk to get a mini-bar key and they were so RUDE! I cannot believe how rude they were. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone until they get their act together!",2
768,"I recently stayed at the Westin Michigan Avenue for a business trip. As always, tend to be impressed with Starwood hotels.  The room was clean, the bed was cozy and the hotel had a good-working Starbucks. I loved the location of this Westin as it's next to great shopping and Rush Street (loaded with great restaurants & bars).  Lastly, the bar at the hotel, The Grill, had a fabulous selection of wine, including a couple favorites - J Vineyards Pinor Nior & Grgich Hills Fume Blanc. I'll be back!",4
769,"Just came back from a quick 1 night stay celebrating our wedding anniversary (and being kidless for a day/night) at this Westin. Overall =4 stars Location = 5 stars.  super easy to walk anywhere in the vicinity. hancock tower is right across the street.  shops, restaurants, etc are everywhere. Service = 5 stars.  have read the other reviews about shoddy service, but ours was excellent overall, except for the car parking folks who took forever to get our car and didn't acknowledge that we were there for 15+ minutes.  We would give 6 stars to the front desk if possible - EDYTA Fizmaurice checked us in and she was super pleasnt, efficient, and friendly.  She is the front desk director - if you see her, get in her line or ask for her. Room quality = 3/4 stars.  4 stars for the great view of the loop.  3 stars for the very bare room and just ok bathroom. Parking = 1 star.  get that it's chicago. get that's it expensive to park anywhere, but $57 for parking, seriously? Price = 5 star.  we got an amazing deal right off the westin website literally the week before at $89+ tax.  You can't even stay at a motel 6 for that in the downtown area. Misc = 5+ star.  about an hour after checking in, we get a knock on the door saying we had room service.  and we didn't order any.  it was a suprise of champagne and strawberries - on the house - in honor of our wedding anniversary.  that was an amazing touch and had us smiling from ear to ear. Overall, we would stay here again even if it's not the best Westin property around.",4
770,"This Westin really does a disservice to the brand. My husband and I are loyal SPG customers and tend to stay on points whenever we travel. For a two night stay in Chicago in June 2010 we were choosing between the W and the Westin and we really chose poorly! The room was barely passable, the bathroom was moldy and the service was indifferent at best. There are lots of great hotels in Chicago - do yourself a favor and stay at one of those.",1
771,Very average rooms and the gym smells bad and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a week...,3
772,"Dated exterior but conveniently close to the Mag mile and the Hancock, this was the hotel I stayed at in July 2006 for the Gay Games. Inside was OK. Probably your usual Westin decor. Loud busy bar that I did not have a chance to try. Beds were very nice and plush. Room was poorly insulated from noise and I could hear some family yammering in Spanish either below or next to us. I expected better for a Westin. They also lied and said they would credit my Starwood account with points they missed but the credit never showed.   I always wanted to stay here and am glad that's now done and over with.",3
773,"I prefer the Westin River North, but this one on Michigan avenue is great if you need to be on Miracle Mile. The staff and amenities are fine, but the location (and shopping!) I think is what's best about it. There's no spa, sauna, steam room, etc., but they do have an ok gym, and in-room spa where an outside spa company sends a massage therapist or aesthetician to you. I'd always wanted to try this and it was definitely worth it (especially after a long business trip and being sick). The in-room spa probably runs about what you would pay at a regular one.  The price of the rooms are comparable to other Westins and I got upgraded to a very nice room. The hotel restaurant (Grill on the Valley or something like that) was much better than other hotel restaurants and it was very lively.",3
774,The best part about this hotel is the location.  Excellent location for day time adventures and night time cocktails.  We had a room with a nice view looking north along the lakefront. The hotel lobby was boring.  The rooms were plain.   Definitely no wow-factor but comfortable and convenient.,3
775,"As a frequent business traveler, I am usually very pleased with Westin properties, but my experience at The Westin on Michigan Ave was absolutely horrible. From the unnecessarily long line to check in to the hotel to the uncomfortable beds, my stay was not am enjoyable experience. The conference taking place at the time didn't add to my stay, as there were dozens of people taking over the lobby and the elevators, and led to a very cramped experience. Additionally, valet took forever and I had a hard time retrieving the packages I had been expecting. Never again will I stay at this hotel, especially because there are so many other great hotels downtown where one can actually be treated well.",1
776,"I stayed at the Westin for three nights last week, and attended a beautiful wedding on the second floor.  You get what you pay for, more or less, which is enough decadence to suit my demands.  In terms of service, there is speed and professionalism.  The beds are comfortable and the showers are wonderful.  I like the free WSJ in the lobby.   The wedding was beautiful, and the food was much better than I could have hoped for.  The view over Michigan Ave was picturesque. The only things that did not suit me were the patented Westin Scent in the lobby which was like a song stuck in my head, and there was no onsite hotel bar, which is often the best place in a hotel.",4
777,"If you can afford it, have your wedding here. Plates are very expensive upwards of over $120-160 per plate.  The minimums are also quite high.  If you can't afford the ballroom, they also have another venue space that can house up to about 120 guests, but it is in their restaurant space on the 2nd(?) floor. Didn't end up having my wedding here because I didn't want the reception in a dingy looking restaurant. Also no where to have the ceremony except for the ballroom.   If you can afford the $15,000 - $20,000 minimum and want an AWESOME location, this might be a good bet for you.",3
778,"Short and sweet... Nice Place, convenient location, friendly service.",4
779,"The location was perfect, the beds were awesomeeeeeeeeeeeee. This is a very very nice hotel. The staff is professional and helpful. The price is up there, but Im glad I had the experience.",5
780,"Probably the best hotel stay so far. I'm generally unimpressed with the price to service ratio at these fancy-ish hotels, but I think this is my new favorite. Location: AWESOME. Right across the street from the Hancock Observatory and the Water Tower Place. There's no lack of food in the area, from cheap (mostly in the mall), to the more expensive, to the moderate (cheesecake factory). There's ""The Grill"" downstairs but it's pretty expensive. I took a cab to all the major landmarks for around 10-$15 (cabs seem to be rather expensive in this city, the places weren't very far away). Rooms: My room was great, I couldn't hear any neighbors and the bed was super comfortable. Room Service: Food was awesome, and I was surprised that when I got hot chocolate with my breakfast that it wasn't a couple packets and some hot water. It was served in a caraffe that stayed hot all morning. They also have EVERY necessity that you may have forgotten that you can have delivered to your room. Price: My room was discounted at $195 for an event, definitely worth it if you ask me. I was very pleased with my stay. The hotel was on a scent theme of ""White Tea"" so the corridors and everything smelled marvelous, and all of the in-room soaps and shampoos smelled like White Tea also (my favorite scent, btw). If I had to complain about anything it would be that during the day, the paid wifi internet is VERY slow, but I was able to hook into the wall for no extra charge so no big deal.",5
781,"I wasn't really impressed by this Westin that much. I didn't have much time to hang out in the hotel because I got in at midnight the one night I stayed there, but my room was underwhelming. The amenities were all good as you'd expect, but there just wasn't the flair of other Westins. My bathroom was kind of small, the room had an odd configuration and it gave off the 70's modern vibe.",3
782,"The lobby here gives you the impression that this is a fantastic hotel (although a bit cramped). The floor I was on, not so much. The halls looked like they hadn't been renovated in the past 20 years and the room was updated, but not very well-laid out. The bathroom was tiny and the hallway (in the room) was huge, but useless. The tub shower didn't work properly, nor did the ventilation (didn't have any). Now THAT works out nicely if you had a bad meal of spicy Indian food the night before. I also didn't like that they didn't bother to replace the soaps with new ones when they cleaned the room. The bed was very comfortable with down pillows and duvet. It was pretty quiet for a downtown hotel too. Staff was very friendly and had me checked in quickly. The workout room here is fantastic. And the hallways on that floor looked so much better than the floor I was on (9th). So I am wondering if the fact I bought the room through Priceline had anything to do with the room I was put in? Probably.",3
783,"I love you priceline! I was a little disappointed as I booked my flight to Chicago to spend a weekend away with my boyfriend as he had to go for a few days for work- there was a gigantic city-wide convention  in town and all the hotels were booked or $300+ to stay anywhere decent. I have been lucky with priceline before- and since I could cancel my Best Western reservation up until 6pm the night of arrival I thought that I would gamble and see what I could get. Luckily we got this place for $100 a night instead of its $369 rack rate. Wooohooo! We were happy with the location as it was right on Michigan Avenue in the thick of things. The room was spacious and clean, but since we got in so late because of our American Airlines flight (we flew them in the middle of all the drama of canceled flights) we could only get a room with two beds that seemed like they were full size. We picked possibly the worst weekend to go as it was pouring rain, windy and freezing the whole time, but we were happy to be able to come back to nap and stay warm in a really nice hotel,",3
784,"Biggest plus here to me was location. It's right across the street from the Hancock building. You're right Millenium Mile so there is A LOT of shopping to be done. You're also right by one of the hop on hop off tour buses so how's that for convenience? The Lobby has been recently updated with nice seating areas and decorated with fresh orchids and other flowers. Wish the lobby was ""grander"" though - for a Westin, it's not a flashy or impressive first impression. Front desk staff was very friendly and efficient, as was the Belldesk. The rooms were clean and updated - granite countertops, curved curtainrods, comfy bedding. We had some issues with the wireless internet; 40% connectivity is pretty low when you're paying 12 dollars a day for internet! We had to call our own company IT as well as the Westin engineer to get up and running. Conference rooms were nice enough, no AV problems. Continental breakfast was so-so. They also did a boxed lunch which was OK. We had them cater a social event too but the food wasn't anything spectacular. Would stay here again.",4
785,"The main reason to stay here is the location. It's right on Michigan Avenue, next to Hancock and Water Tower. Ultimate location to start any Chicago adventure. The hotel is newly remodeled, quite nicely I must add as I remember the old version (Hellloooo, pastels!) Hotel lobby is uber modern and clean, but unfortunately the meeting rooms don't necessarily match that feel. Rooms have also been updated, and I'm sure there is a premium for a lake or Michigan Avenue view. Probably not for the wall view I got! Beds super cushy comfy with tons of pillows, key. Reception was more than cool with my request to extend checkout until 2:00 p.m. and no housekeeping knocking on my door (a pet peeve). Went to a large event here and the catering and event department did a great job. As far as I could tell, quite smooth considering they were serving 75 sloshed Irish firefighters and their rambunctious dates.",3
786,"Quick Review, more too come. We had our wedding reception here on November 21, 2009.  We had the absolutely best experience with Phyllis Washington, the Hotel Catering Manager.  Phyllis is a consummate professional and should have her own wedding show on TV.",5
787,"I really liked this hotel until they messed up my reservation and I was looked out of my room.   I was there for a conference and paid the conference room rate, but I extended one extra day, and had to pay a different rate.  I discussed this with the staff at the front desk when I checked in and they said it would not be a problem. Unfortunately, it was a problem.  I got locked out of my room the last day of the conference, and to top it all off, I left my ID in the room.  I had to wait one whole hour for security to come by and open the door for me.  Then I had to run back down to the front desk and wait another thirty minutes in line to take care of my room cards. I was all set to go out for a night on the town before leaving, and it was interrupted by a problem that should have not happened. Other than that, I really liked the hotel, the staff, exercise facilities, and especially the location.",3
788,"So I am here right now.  I had a layover in O'Hare and my flight was cancelled.  So i'm staying in Chicago for a night.  The hotel is nice.   Service:  Well, the only thing that kinda bugged is the fact that the girl who checked me in, gave me a room that someone else had.  How ackward.  So I had to go downstairs and get a new room.   Rooms:  The room gave me a funky vibe at first.  I went in and turned on all of the lights and the television.  But i'm in here now and I'm okay.   Amenities:  One main reason why i stay at Westin hotels is for the heavenly bed and the heavenly shower.  I've always been a big fan and I can't wait to go to sleep.",4
789,"We used the Westin for our wedding room block and found it to be a perfect fit! Rates were a little high but it was marathon weekend so we expected it.  We did have a few glitches throughout the planning process and check in but Abbie Armbruster, our contact, quickly and professionally addressed them.  I would definitely recommend for groups or personal travel!",4
790,"Note: This is more a review for the hosting an event aspect of this hotel, not the staying here on vacation aspect. When I got engaged, I traversed the whole city in search of a reception venue that screamed ""Chicago.""  Originally, I was determined to have a non-traditional venue, but I begrudgingly checked out some downtown hotels-- and was really surprised at how much I liked the Westin. The ballroom looked out onto Michigan Ave, everything was inclusive of sales tax/service charge so the prices you saw were what you were charged (the 30% was not tacked on afterward like comparable downtown hotels), the decor was clean & contemporary without being too trendy, and best of all, it was nice but without the snootiness. (Seriously, I cannot stand pretentiousness!) The biggest gamble was the food as you sign the contract before the tasting, but it all turned out splendidly in the end. The food was awesome at the tasting and I was just praying it would be the same at the event-- and it was. People are still raving to us & our families about how great it all was, especially the steak. I can attest to its quality myself, as you bet your ass I made sure that I would be eating the meal I was paying for. :-) And while I didn't stay in a typical room, I did get a kickass suite to get ready in, and I took advantage of getting it at the discounted room block rate for the night before as well. Check-in wasn't until 3, but the room was ready for me at noon. It had an awesome view looking out onto Michigan Ave & the bed was plush & comfy-- super important for a stressed out insomniac bride-to-be! This is not your cheapest option for a Chicago wedding, but it truly is a good value for a downtown hotel right on Michigan Avenue, and less expensive than the nearby comparable hotels. P.S. If you do host an event here, and have the money upfront & can make the payments in full, get a Starwood Amex credit card. You'll thank me later. :-)",5
791,"Excelllent as all westins are! While their beds are the best reason to come here, I also enjoy knowing that the rooms and entire property are going to be spotless! Cant beat the location! We had our 6 month old son so taking public transportation was out of the question so we walked everywhere, which is not hard since you are right in the middle of it all. I didnt like that parking was so expensive, we parked around the corner at some gated lot for 1/3 the price. Other than that i would stay again. We would be staying again during this trip but we decided to check out the omni, i'll let you know how they compare!",4
792,"I haven't stayed at this property in a while so it was time for a checkup.   Located at the north end of Michigan Avenue this property is all about location, location, location.  In the shadow of the Hancock center, a stones throw from Watertower Place and abundant, restaurants, nightlife and shopping. The last time I stayed here the management was totally inept and I ripped off a seething letter.  I was happy to be informed that the individual, who made my previous stay hell, has been relieved of his duties. Other than a long line at check in this property this property has improved by leaps and bounds. Long line at check in as staff was changing shifts. There is a dedicated Starwood Gold/Platinum line.  The G/P line was unoccupied as I waited in line and opened, alone with another check in, when I was second in line. The lobby and common areas are very clean, bright, well lit and maintained.  In the lobby they have a refreshment center right next to check in line. The room I was assigned comprised of a nice sized bedroom and corner parlor to make up a pretty large suite. The suite was large enough to accommodate several people. Overall First Impression, renovated and on par with the DC and Philly Westin's I've recently visited.  This Westin's Heavenly bed wasn't as firm as I like, but all the accoutrements of the Heavenly Bed was there.  The room is decorated in a casual modern decor and in good condition.  Décor is appropriate for Downtown urban hotel.  The closet was a bit on the tiny side, for a room it's size the closet seemed out of proportion.  The 27"" TV is a disappoint, but I understand that they will be upgraded to 40"" sets soon. There is ample lighting in the room and the room has large windows so there is a ton of natural light.  The workspace desk shares the ice chest and other items and could be a problem for some.  There were extra electric outlets in the room for those with lots of devices.  The room has a nice  view since it is a corner room.  You can see up and down Michigan Avenue.  No iPod docking station and a dated radio.  Starwood has to up it's game in this area. Very long narrow bathroom, but no separate shower.  I found that odd for a bathroom of this size.  While in the bathroom I could vaguely hear people in the hallway.  The bathroom has dual sinks with lots of counter space and great lighting. A heavenly bath but no separate shower. The parlor connected from the bedroom.  Walking out of the bedroom into the parlor there was a nice sized bathroom.  With amenities that matched the bedroom bathroom.   There was a large desk with lots of outlets and a great view looking south on Michigan Avenue.  The room is a nice size and has a sofa, two club chairs and few ottomans.  The is a Murphy bed and a huge closet.  In addition, the parlor has a Bose radio.   The housekeeping staff was adequate. I had the DND sign on the door and was never interrupted.  They replaced all items and toiletries on each night of my stay.  Received turndown service every evening. This Westin features a nice sized Fitness Center with up to date cardio machines & ellipticals, a smaller room with free weights off to the side. There is no pool or club lounge at this property. Free Internet in the lobby, $13 a night in rooms.  Signal was strong throughout the suite and suffered no interruptions. Did not use valet, as there is no car for a car in Chicago.  The hotel is convenient to public transportation, cabs are plenty and always ready right out the front door. FINAL IMPRESSION Overall hotel cleanliness: On par with other Westin properties and cleaner than the W's Staff attitude, conduct & support: Staff has greatly improved, over my last stay.  The staff has had a complete overhaul for the better.  Everyone was prompt and attentive. Location: Great location. Can walk to your office (if on business), restaurants, attractions, parks, and shopping. Would I return? Yes. Would I recommend this as family friendly? No. Good for business travelers? Yes. Good for a romantic get away?  Yes, nice rooms and spa services. Would I recommend for someone looking for Dining/Nightlife? Yes Would I recommend restaurant? NA Value for price paid? Good Overall property rating on a scale from 1 to 5 = 4.5 since there is no pool or lounge.",5
793,"DO NOT have your wedding room block here!!!!! We had our wedding room block here in August for our wedding (our wedding was not at the hotel though). We had nothing but issues, issues, and more issues. It was the biggest problem that we had in all of our wedding plans. The hotel itself is nice, clean, and the beds are very comfortable. I have no complaints about the quality of the hotel and furnishings. Our first issue was that we were misled about the nature of the room block. We were reassured that when the initial block was filled, we would be able to add 5 more rooms at a time, no problem whatsoever. What they failed to mention was that they would hassle with us about the room rate. Next issue, my grandfather needed a handicapped room. The reservation was made 8 months in advance, and when he checked in....no handicapped room for him. Had to wait 24 hrs. for a handicapped room. Unexcusable. Next issue, multiple guests were not able to check in by 3 pm. One guest had driven from Canada and was not able to check into her room until 7 pm. This was because someone was still occupying the room. They reassured her this person would be charged. They did not however offer her another room, or offer anything to her at all! Again, unexcusable. Next issue, the gift bags I provided for the guests were not properly delivered to the right guests. I had provided a typed, very clear list of which guests were to receive bags to the bellman (this is the Westin's policy). I had to speak with the bellman multiple times about gift bags not being delivered. I should not have to do this the weekend I am getting married!! The biggest issue...they charge $2.50 per gift bag. When I'm paying for this service, it should be done correctly. The service at this hotel is ridiculously unexcusable!!!",1
794,"I walked in to the Westin expecting the Westins I saw as a kid that were not hip one iota.  Starwood moved some of the W style over this a way.  Slick lobby with a nice straight modern Eames-esque woodgrain look.  The beds are clearly a big draw as well as a double showerhead that has so much pressure your body may well have some red spots for a few hours if you stay in one place for a minute.  Of course, the location is great for a visitor with all the Mich Ave stuff.  Let's just say H&M saved my ass when I forgot my tie for a job interview.",4
795,"Pleasant hotel experience-nothing too special about the hotel but it was clean, comfortable and the staff was very friendly.  Excellent location to shop Mich. ave and see the Chicago sights.  The one thing I was a little miffed about was that there was no robe in the room.  At a supposed 4 star hotel, this is something I expect and am not happy to find out otherwise...minus 1 star.",3
796,"The hotel itself was nice, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient to shopping. If not for the following inconveniences and lack of service, I would probably give it 4 stars: Check-in was a huge hassle because I unwittingly used http://getaroom.com, when I thought I was calling the hotel directly.  Eventually, after waiting over 20 minutes, the people at the desk were willing to put a hold on my credit card while they waited for http://getaroom.com to get back to them about my reservation, which was already paid for.  But they could have done that from the start, rather than making me stand in the lobby for all of that time. Also, I was told internet would be free in my room.  It asked to charge me at log on, so I called to the front desk.  they told me to accept the charges, and assured me that I would not be charged.  At check-out, the charge was on my invoice.  The person at the counter printed me a new invoice, and assured me I would not be charged.  Two days later, I notice that my bank account has been charged $13 for internet usage.  I am now waiting for the hotel to refund it. In addition, very early on Sunday morning, the housekeeping attempted to open my door, because I forgot to put up a ""do not disturb"" sign. I thought that was rude and I am glad that I had latched the interior door lock, otherwise she would have walked right in. Also, be aware that parking is $60 per day and valet only. When I got my car, the window was rolled halfway down on the passenger side, which makes me believe it was probably left that way all night.   Overall, not the worst hotel I have stayed at, the room was clean and comfortable, and the location and price were ok, but the service really kind of sucked.",3
797,"yes, this is what a moderately expensive hotel is supposed to be.  it is always always always the same; service, rooms, healthclub (well that's actually been upgraded in the past few years).  you can't find a nicer valet guy...wish i could remember his name cuz he always remembers mine, like a scene from a movie.  not that i even stay there thaaaaat often but this older gentleman always says, ""Ms. my last name, you're back.  Good to see you.  How's Champaign?"" the crowd here is so focused on work that you never feel like wishing it was ok to shush people...everyone is already shushed.  i've never had a single bad experience here.",5
798,I LOVE Westin!  The staff here were so friendly and did a great job assisting us.  I had 2 rooms - 1 with my niece and nephew and one for my wife and I.  The price was pretty good and the service even better.  Awesome location .... you cannot beat it!,4
799,"it's just that it's crowded. i think that's really it the rooms aren't bad, though a little smaller. but it's a downtown hotel, at maximum capacity, all the time. as long as you don't need any servicing for anything, it's fine. but if you want anything (fix the shower), be prepared to wait an hour, or (i need deoderant) it may not come at all",3
800,"The Westin on Michigan Avenue enjoys one of the prime locations in the city. It is just north of the John Hancock Center, which has a plaza that is the unofficial outdoor porch of the hotel. The rooms are very nice but not top-notch, suffering only in comparison to the competing five-star hotels in the area. The front desk area can be very busy, but the beds are ""heavenly"".",4
801,"Solid location.  Clean, stale rooms.  Not very memorable in either a good or bad way.",4
802,"Ok, they have the best showers...if not the smallest bathrooms. And really, charging for everything? And ridiculous charges at that! Sure I realize baseball players stay here and they can spend money like water, but damn...I'm not Jay-Z! They also have awesome beds with great comforters, and the place is relatively sharp, clean, and fancy...but i'd never stay here if i had to spend more than $65.",3
803,"I've stayed at this hotel a couple of different times for short stays.  It's a nice spot on Michigan Ave and close to shopping, food, etc.  The gym is very small for this size of hotel, but works.  The last time I stayed here I got upgraded to a three room suite that was very nice.  Overall I would come back here next time I am in Chicago.",3
804,Perfect location when coming to Chicago to shop and go out.  Besides the fact that they messed my reservation up 4 times (seriously) I had a great time and our rooms were spacious.  Dont forget Westin's beds they rock!,4
805,"The worst Westin and hotel experience ever. Staying here ruined our suppose to be wonderful engagement weekend. My fiance had just proposed and had flown me out to Chicago as his job was relocating him. We were suppose to celebrate and check out the area. When we got there, our nonsmoking King room with a view was no longer available. My fiance had called in and put in a special request and they said they would honor it. We ended up in a smoking room, and then we ended up with two full beds. Oh how romantic. Not only that, for the four days we were there, the rooms were rarely made before three pm. We have since stayed at the Westin across from the House of Blues. Those rooms were must bigger, the people were nicer, and the service excellent. The service at this Westin sucked and all the management offered us was a free meal from the room service menu. Yeah!",1
806,"Excellent hotel because of the prompt service and location! We found deals on Travelzoo and were so happy with the location. Less than a mile away from all of the shopping, restaurants, the beach, and clubs/bars. My only complaint is that the walls were paper thin and we all got pretty loud and some point but no one ever came to complain.  I would definitely stay here again!!",4
807,"expensive. pretty. fun. the bed is amazing. the rooms are nice. but the shower and toilet sucked big time. the front desk is slow at picking up and not very polite. they need to do something about this. anyways, i love it that the 11th floor has a bowl full of apples everyday in the hallway for people to enjoy.",4
808,Stayed for one night and for $260 total compared to sleeping at the Sheraton Chicago.  The bed was comfortable and the front desk service was exceptionally courteous and polite.  I'd come again for a cheaper rate since all I tend to do in a hotel is sleep so amenities are not on my priority but the location is good for being near a lot of the businesses and some of the northern touristy spots.  But a hike from Grant park if you want to hoof it to see the other sets of the tourist hotspots.,3
809,"This review pertains to our wonderful wedding reception that we had at the Westin (Michigan Avenue) this fall.  Annie was our wedding coordinator and she was fabulous.  She worked closely with us and listened intently to all our visions and needs.  She promptly returned e-mails and returned phone calls and was never too busy to have an impromtu meeting with me.  As for the food--the food was seriously excellent--especially the buttermilk poached chicken with artichoke ravioli, spinach and mushroom confit.  It was not your typical ""wedding chicken.""  It was scrumptous--our guests raved about it!  Our room was awesome--the Consort Ballroom is a private room on the 16th floor with windows on three sides with views of Michigan Avenue, Water Tower, Lake Shore Drive and the Lake!  Overall, our wedding was wonderful and I couldn't imagine changing a thing.",5
810,"Have stayed here twice and had nothing but spectacular service. This hotel has a great swanky feel, but the price is just about right. (Was able to score a sweet deal using some starwood points)  This is the hotel where almost ALL the MLB teams stay and you're likely to spot players all over the hotel during the season. Even if you're not staying here, take a load off in the cool reception area and people watch.",5
811,Yay! Typical Westin good service is an absolutely perfect location. My only complaints: expensive parking and gym not the best. I'll stay here again if in Chicago.,4
812,"As everyone says, great location......I will review the hotel.  I agree with most everyone, the beds are great, the rooms are small and uninspired and the lobby is just that....a lobby.  We had a very good experience with the staff, they were nice and helpful.  Room is loud with the hallway noise, but it didn't bother us too much.  We were on the 4th floor with a roof right outside our window....in case of fire we would be in the perfect room....however, no view in the meantime, and luckily no fire.  I am sure most rooms have great views due to the location.  Overall, I would stay here again for sure.",3
813,"Lucky me, I got to stay at this lovely spot on the Magnificent Mile for a whole week for work.  This was my first time in Chicago and it really helped me make the most of my experience!  I love the Westin's amenities, especially the Heavenly Bed.  I got wonderful rest so I could make the most of my nights out and still be refreshed to do work the next day!  I also love their service express, which will bring you virtually anything you need in about 30 minutes.  I forgot my toothbrush, which was promptly brought to my room.  I also asked for some bathroom slippers.  My coworker asked for a razor and got shaving cream too (how considerate!), and even nail polish remover and a curling iron!  Now, that really tells me they mean business when they call it SERVICE express.  I really like the Grille downstairs too.  They have a really great bar where most of my coworkers socialized every night, and had some meals.  Good grill food, amazing cocktails (I love it when bartenders take their cocktails seriously).   My only complaint is that they don't have the flat screen tvs here yet.  I've stayed at the Westin in Philadelphia, and the TV's really bring it up a notch.  Can't wait to stay here again when I visit Chicago next time!",4
814,"I would agree with Joe H. on his review. I was checked into a room where the bathroom was COVERED in mold. I stayed in the room about 2 nights and had to request a new room, they upgraded me to a different room, which had a partial view. This is also the second time that I have left something at a Westin Hotel and they have ""lost"" my lost item. This time I had left behind a $150 Eileen Fisher shirt. I called 2 days after I had left, when I saw I left the shirt behind, and the lost and found said they could not find it. They did not take the description of the shirt down, all he wanted to know was what floor I was on, then proceeded to inform me that there were other shirts found but none matching my description. I got VERY frustrated and explained he never TOOK a description of the shirt, so then he asked what it looked like, waited 3 minutes and said ""No, no shirts like that were left behind"". I called again today (2 months after the fact) and was told all clothing left behind is thrown away. I was NOT impressed with this hotel nor their service. I have always been impressed with Westin, but not this hotel. Take my advice and others...this is NOT worth the money you will be spending.",2
815,"Wow.  This really is the worst Westin in the nation.  I've actually been lurking on Yelp reading reviews for a while now, this hotel prompted me to register and write my first review to warn people.  My wife and I frequently stay in Starwood properties, and we have been Platinum Preferred Members of Starwood for some time now.  So far, so good (until recently).  I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to hotel rooms, and I understand that you get what you pay for.  All I ask is the room is clean.  Sheets, surfaces, etc.  If I pay for a luxury room, I expect a bit more, but overall pretty easy to please.  For Westin, I was expecting middle of the road.  OK, lets get to the hotel.  The first room we got upon check-in was dirty.  I mean, there was a crust (not sure what) on the glass covered nightstand, a layer of dust on the lights, the carpet was stained in several places, the chair looked like it was from a garage sale (stained/dirty) and the toilet, lets not even go there.  I called and spoke to the ""Director of Client Relations/Satisfaction"".  I asked her, please just go look at the room and see what you are putting your guests in......  She declined.   Our new room on the ""Preferred"" 14th floor (for only preferred guests) was just as dirty.  The ceiling in the bathroom, I have to guess, is lower than seven feet (in San Francisco, that's illegal, not sure about here).  Bottom line, location is great, lobby is nice, and the rooms represent the worst Starwood property in the nation.  Avoid it, stay somewhere else.",2
816,"My Husband and l couldn't find a baby sitter to watch our toddler on Valentines day 2009 and so we decided to have early dinner with our son.The only places we were looking at going were Hotel restaurants because we knew they would be family friendly and so we were glad to have a reservation at the Westin hotel, it had a nice location, not crowded at 4.30pm,we were happy when we arrived.However,all that changed when our waitress arrived.Oh my God, talk about taking away the joy of Valentines,She never smiled, she aggressively asked for our lds when we asked for our drinks,it was not the fact that she asked for it,it was HOW she asked, you would think she was a cop.She brought my steak well-done after l specifically requested for it to be medium rare.Our Whole dinner was ruined, it was such a beautiful restaurant and this silly woman had to ruin it with her negative energy. l reckon you must have a heart of stone not to respond to my sons smile or very bubbly personality and she did not once for the entire dinner say anything friendly to him,even though l could see her being friendly and smiley to another couple at another table not too far from ours! l did not think it necessary to complain.Personally, l would never be back. All that negative energy, unfortunately, took away from the lovely gesture of the restaurant giving out Valentine roses to everyone and the smiley faces of the other waitresses and staff of this place.If only we had a normal waitress,everything would have been perfect!",1
817,"We visited Chicago for a long weekend and found this hotel online.  We liked the idea of staying in a non-chain hotel, but location and price were also important considerations for us.  When we arrived, we were greeted at the front desk by Patty who set the tone for the entire weekend.  She was friendly, professional, and helpful.  We talked with her a couple of other times during our stay to ask for directions or restaurant recommendations and her hospitality was incredible and very much appreciated.  We didn't expect that in a big hotel in such a large city.  The rest of the staff -- from the housekeepers to the doormen -- were great, too. Our room was on the 9th floor and was surprisingly spacious for an older hotel.  We're also a little snobby when it comes to beds, bedding, and bathrooms and we had no complaints at all.  We could barely hear the el trains from our room and, when we did hear them, it sounded more like white noise and didn't interfere with our sleep or relaxation.   We definitely enjoyed our stay at the Silversmith and are hoping to stay there again during our next visit!",5
818,My friend stayed here with her fam when she was in town. seemed a little pricey for the accommodations and amenities.,3
819,"Location location location! This hotel is near everything - all the subway lines are within 3 blocks and Michican Ave and Millenium Park are only a few blocks away as well. I got this hotel on Hotwire (never done it before - makes me nervous not seeing the hotel first!) for about $140/night when everywhere else in the area was close to $200 plus so I was happy about that. Front desk was extremely friendly and helpful the entire time; used the Yelp check in to get a suite - having the extra room came in handy throughout the trip. The suite was ready when we checked in on the very early side of around 11AM. Loved the water infused with fresh fruit in the lobby. Gym was pretty OK - 1 elliptical, 2 treadmills, 1 stepper and a weight machine. Wish the room was bigger and they had dumbells but I have seen far worse hotel gyms. Rooms show a little wear and tear and decor is not to my taste but the bed was super comfy and the tub/shower were good so I really can't complain! The room was always spotless so that is another plus. I wouldn't hesitate to come back!",4
820,"We were able to get a room at this hotel on Hotwire for a great price.  When we arrived and checked in on yelp, we got a free room upgrade to a suite.  Yay!  We also were able to check in early. The staff is friendly and always ready to answer questions.  The location is great.   The hotel is a little older and some of the furnishings are outdated. But if you can look past that, it's a great little place.",4
821,"After a horrible night at the Drake (reviewed), this place was a surprisingly pleasant treat. Unpretentious and with a great central loop location, the hotel was perfect for my needs. INCREDIBLY friendly staff, HUGE bathroom, free vouchers for drinks and breakfast, low price. Not the most updated hotel (tvs are not flat screen, wood of armoire and bed headboards look a little dated, building is sort of narrow and old) but it's not that much better at any of the other fancy shmancy hotels I've been to. We stayed on third floor and I could hear the L go by, but it wasn't loud enough that it kept me awake or woke me up. I was bummed to see the free check-in upgrade offer, but our room was perfectly fine. Definitely recommend, definitely would come here again.",5
822,"Got this hotel through Hotwire at a very good price for the area and class. Based on reviews we figured we couldn't go too wrong and were not disappointed. From the start, everyone was pleasant, helpful, quick, eager to assist. The room was clean, comfortable,  and large enough for our family of four (we had wanted two doubles but were ""upgraded"" to a suite with a king and pull out. This worked out but was not truly an upgrade for us. Nice touches were free wireless internet (worked fine for us all weekend), free safe, whirlpool tub, separate shower, large rooms, close walking to many sites and eateries. Noise was only a problem one night when our neighbors were closing their door (letting it slam shut) continually at 2 in the morning. Most hotels have a lack of noise proofing around the door and this was no exception. That said, it really was only a problem once and briefly. Parking is what it is for downtown Chicago - you pay for it here but the Valet staff were great and will get your car whenever you need.",4
823,"I've stayed at the Silversmith twice and am planning on a third stay this autumn. The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful each time I entered the hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are large and clean. Each time I've reserved a room, I've requested to be placed away from the El train and have been accommodated.They upgraded their internet service sometime between my stays there in 2010 and 2011, and I had no trouble at all with the wi-fi. The hotel is in a GREAT location for visiting downtown Chicago. CTA trains that circle the Loop have a stop right at the intersection where the hotel is located. Millenium Park is just down the block, and the Magnificent Mile is approximately ten blocks away. There is plenty to do and plenty of places to eat within walking distance of the hotel, and for venturing further out, trains and cabs are easily accessible. I've stayed, and plan to stay, at the Silversmith during the Chicago Marathon. I'm sure the price is higher during this weekend, but when compared to other hotels in the area, even those officially partnered with the Marathon, the Silversmith was the best price and in a better location than most. The only reason I didn't give five stars, and I'm sure this doesn't matter to most, is that I feel they need to upgrade their TV's. I know, it's a minor thing, but if you're looking to keep the kids entertained or, like me, your looking to spend time in the room preparing for or recovering from a REALLY long run, the TV thing is important. I highly recommend the Silversmith, and I plan to continue staying there each time I visit Chicago.",4
824,"I liked this hotel for it's location to all the events that we attended like Chicago Symphony concerts, the art museum, as well as some good nearby restaurants.  It was next to the L but our room was located in a place that we really didn't hear it.  The staff was very courteous and friendly and there was always someone at the entrance greeting and welcoming you back.  Our only complaints were maintenance issues like a bathroom door and armoir door that didn't close properly.  The room rates were good considering how close it is to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave.",4
825,"Loved this hotel! It was in an amazing location considering we didn't have a car. We were close to many attractions, the train, and several bus stops! The staff was amazing... so nice and helpful! The train is right in front of the hotel and our room faced it but you could barely hear it. It never woke us up or anything. Very clean and would stay here again when in the area!",4
826,"The top things about the Silversmith that I must point out first are LOCATION and VALUE.  But the actual hotel, and the experience were nothing to complain about either.  We never get a hotel in Chicago, and we most definitely would not expect to find something affordable downtown.  But somehow we managed to do so.  With our Yelp check-in , we were even upgraded to a suite (which I would be fine without).  But it was lovely. Every point of contact with the staff was positive from the moment the door was opened for us downstairs , to the lobby with our checking in & out. The rooms were clean.  The suites are good sized.  The bathroom was awesome.  Good water pressure, nice shower, AND a tub (granted I am assuming the regular rooms only have a regular sized bathroom). We had no complaints, and this was an excellent choice for the rate.  The best part for us was that we were able to access the orange, red, and blue lines easily.  AND since we took Amtrak this time, we also were able to walk to the train station (if you have a ton of luggage, you might want to grab a cab). We will definitely stay here again.  Overall a very good experience.",4
827,"Absolutely loved my two evennings in this downtown Chicago boutique hotel. Great price (Groupon), lovely rooms & conviently tastey restaurant.",4
828,I was pleasantly surprised with the Silversmith Hotel.  Our double bed room was very large compared to most downtown Chicago hotels I've stayed in.  The beds were very comfortable and the room/bathroom was clean and well maintained.  The front desk staff was very friendly as well.  Millennium Park was just a couple of blocks away & the hotel is located just steps from a subway line.  It made getting around town very convenient!  The price was excellent for staying in the heart of downtown Chicago for 3 nights!   I would definitely stay again!,4
829,Very friendly people!! My now fiancé had a birthday and we were also celebrating 4 years together and told them we had yelp and they upgraded us as a surprise. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are very clean and HUGE!!! I will deff stay here again.,5
830,"BEST LOCATION YOUR MONEY COULD GET! We checked into the Silversmith on Yelp! and found us an upgrade to a suite. We were there at 4pm, and check-in time was 3, so that's why I think there were still suites available for upgrades.  The room itself was older, but it did not have that smell of an older room. You can tell they take good care of their rooms. The staff were all friendly, and are eager to help us out with the easiest bus routes to certain places. I think I read reaviews on it could potentially be a bit noisy because the hotel is situated right next to the train line, so we requested a room away from the streets and got our peace that way. I could barely hear passing trains when I wake up in the morning. Again, I cannot rave enough on their location. It was our first time in Chicago, so of course we wanted to go everywhere, and this hotel was really smacked dabbed in the middle. It took minutes to walk to the bus stops that would take us anywhere south or north of downtown. I'm so happy we chose the Silversmith. p.s. free wifi and an in-room fridge definitely earn this hotel another half a star. This would be a 5-star review if they have a microwave in the room to heat up my delicious Chicago food leftovers.",4
831,"Silversmith has that old traditional feel, which is not my style so there was no wow factor as far as interior decor goes here.  The metal scrolls on each hotel room door was a nice touch though.  Everything else had that old wood ""creaky"" feeling to me.   Really enjoyed the staff.  They're all so nice. I happened to leave something at the desk during check in (where others were checking in too) and as I entered my room, my phone was ringing and it was the front desk letting me know I had forgotten it there.  Neat :) This hotel wins for - Location (though I'm sure any downtown hotel would get a point for this!) - Price - not bad for the location.  About $200 a night. - Staff - unbelievably nice.  The bellman even went on a stroll along the streets with me to show me some restaurants and favorite spots since it was my first time visiting Chicago. Parking fees are NOT cheap though.  I believe it was over $40 and I wasn't there for more than 24 hours. Yikes.",4
832,"Location is what this hotel is all about. It is within walking distance of Millennium Park, State Street Shopping, and even the Sears tower, andn many, many other tourist attractions. The L is right outside, so if you need to go anywhere, it's steps away. And don't worry about it being loud - I slept fine there.   However, I wasn't crazy about their room and decor. They are older, and the room we had was a bit too old for my taste. The bathroom was clean, but it didn't have the new industrial touch many other hotels I've stayed at did. While I like the location of Silversmith, I would still prefer a hotel near the Magnificent Miles, since the Loop isn't as cool at night. I guess it is fine if you're just looking for a practical place to stay while in Chicago, but if you're looking for something a bit more ""special,"" I'd recommend other hotels.",3
833,Got a room for $89 and got an upgrade with my Yelp check-in. The suite was a great value. Had no problem with noise and the staff was super-friendly. Would go back in a heartbeat if I had to be in that area of Chicago.,4
834,"I give this hotel a 5-star FOR ITS CLASS (i.e., we are not talking the Four Seasons. However, it's easily above run-of-the-mill Hilton's and Marriot's in which I often stay). It was a combination of great price, extremely customer-focused service, nice decor, very comfortable room, etc. I chose this hotel for its proximity to a meeting I had. I read reviews in yelp, and was concerned that some guest rooms were near the subway line. I called in advance and asked for a room  far from the subway, and they assured me rooms on the other side of the hotel are quiet. When I arrived, they had put me in a king suite, at the same exceptionally low price as the regular rooms with queen-sized beds. About 30 minutes after I'd settled in, Elizabeth at the front desk called to see whether everything was to my liking. Nice touch. The women at the front desk were exceptionally courteous and customer-focused throughout my stay. Most of the bell men were also, with Louis, in particular, being wonderful (from the warm greeting at my initial arrival, to offering to wak my luggage to the subway [which was a better bet to the airport than a cab during rush hour] in quite cold temperature). The room itself was spacious, warm, comfortable. The metalwork art throughout much of the hotel (which I supposed represents silversmithery), and other artwork, were tasteful. Wifi was reliable (and also free). All in all, great value for the price. I'll look to stay agin on future trips to Chicago.",5
835,"Good price from the location, which is a five minute walk from millennium park, however the ""traditional"" theme they boast I saw as simply old and 90's looking. Good location, good price, bad decor and furniture.",3
836,Pros: -In the heart of the loop near Millennium Park -Extremely friendly staff -Fairly cheap rates (I paid $116 a night which is much lower than the average hotel in that area -Large clean room with comfortable beds Cons: -There's a lot of noise from the hallways and other rooms that doesn't get blocked out by the door or walls -Free Internet was neither wireless nor functional. The internet literally crawled. I would have rather paid for wifi that worked decently but that wasn't an option.,3
837,"We stayed there over the Memorial Day weekend. I'll net it out. The location was fabulous, and the price was very reasonable. The staff was very friendly and professional. Our room was right over the El tracks. We could hear the trains go by, but it didn't keep us awake (although I would definitely be concerned about being on a lower floor -- we were on the 6th). The wallpaper was starting to peel off in a couple of spots, but nothing major. We were traveling with our teenager, and all wanted a little privacy, so we reserved a suite with a king sized bed and a fold out couch. The bed was quite comfortable, but the sofa bed was atrociously uncomfortable. The suite didn't have a door between the bedroom and the sleeping area, and no mention of that fact was made on the website when we reserved the room.",3
838,"Was able to get a room in a pinch on a very busy convention weekend in Chicago. That was the best part of this place. I'd second a lot of the other comments although I'm not sure why the ratings were otherwise so high. The rate was good for a hotel in a good location in Chicago. I had a decent sized suite with really all the amenities you'd expect in a hotel - including a safe, which I feel is a rare find these days. The bad: The train is an issue. We were on the 5th floor facing the train. It was loud enough to be annoying, but really did not keep me up. I could see it being a huge problem in 3rd floor rooms. The bed and mattress were old and creaky, and the room was really dry, so I really didn't get a good night sleep either night I was there. Finally, there was absolutely no style. It was all beige, tan, and lightly stained wood with Target-esque faux modern light fixtures. Blah.",2
839,"I stayed at the Silversmith for 4 days in July.  The hotel lobby was pretty and the lounge/guest area was huge and comfortable. Our room was in an L-Shape.  I had a King Size Bed (think it was California King), desk and couch in one part of the L Shape. The other side of the L was the half Kitchen (Miniature Fridge and wet bar) and HUGE bathroom.  If anybody is curious, my room was 1012.  My friend also stayed in 512, which had the same layout as mine. One of the great things about the hotel is that they have ""Dessert"" hour from 9pm - 10pm from Mondays thru Thursday. And their dessert was impressive.  When we went, they served three types of cake (two cheesecakes and a Carrot Cake) with cookies and coffee/tea.   The weird thing that I found about the Concierge is that when you check in, they prefer that you have your Confirmation number instead of providing your name for some reason.  I sensed that they were really persistent with getting the Confirmation number before searching for your name on the system for some reason.   But my stay was great, in the middle of the loop, two blocks away from the Blue Line, next to great Pubs and shopping area.",4
840,"I'm originally from Chicago, and when I go back I try to stay here whenever it's feasible. The rooms are nicely decorated and some have funky shapes - no standard cube, which I enjoy. Nice staff, great location for downtown activities, and it's next to the L so I can hop on and visit friends just about anywhere in the city without too much trouble. Yes, some rooms don't have great views. But you are in Chicago - if you want a view, go visit the Sears Tower or Hancock Building. Book your room online for best rates. And remember - you can always request a room on the non-L side when you check in.",4
841,I was robbed in the lobby and far from helping hotel staff were upset at me! On top of this rooms are very noisy from the L. Avoid. Many better options at this price.,1
842,"I really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel decor has a touch of elegance without being pretenious. We had a room facing the inner courtyard, so noise from the L was not a problem. The room was huge with a bathroom that was twice the size of a college dorm room. It even had a jacuzzi bath tub seperate from the shower. The location is perfect for traveling by train. It is a short walk from Union Station. It is also a short walk to the art institute, Grant Park, shopping, theaters, and restaurants. Ada's (the restaruant on the ground floor of the hotel) provides a quick and easy choice for breakfast or lunch. There is an L station around the corner, making it easy to get around the city day or night. I only have two complaints, both of which would not prevent me from returning. First, the room was a little warm our first day and night there. The rooms have an automatic system which turns off 30 minutes after leaving the room. I think we figured out a way to make it stay on just until the room temperature was better. Second, we wanted to watch a movie and relax but were deterred by the $14,95 charge for the movies. I might have paid 7-10, but $15 for a movie was a little unreasonable. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, although I like the http://hotels.com price for much better than their standard room rates.",4
843,"Clean, eco friendly, huge room, $89/night on orbitz = great stay Location is great.  Short walk to everything. Didn't hear the train at all and liked being near the stop.",4
844,"This review is a bit overdue.  I stayed for a conference at McCormick Place in December.  I got a really good deal through TravelZoo.  I followed the advice of another Yelper and checked in using my Yelp app and was upgraded to a suite (you can also use Foursquare to receive the same upgrade).   First of all, the location is great.  The temperature was in the teens and I was able to take the L from Midway and didn't have to walk more than a few yards to get to the front door of the hotel.  And the subway station to O'Hare for the trip home was only a couple blocks.  Having to go to McCormick Place which was south of the hotel and want to visit the theater district and Magnificent Mile, the location was very convenient.  So, if you're without a car, this is a nice place to stay. The hotel and room is a bit dated, but as many have said, it is clean and the rooms are relatively large.  I was traveling alone, but if I was with others, the roomy bathroom would definitely be a plus.  My suite had large windows in the bedroom, so since it was cold, there was a bit of a battle between the heater and the coldness coming off the windows, but it was not a major issue.  As far as the train goes, you do hear it.  However, it's not noticeable if you are accustomed to city noises.  If you need silence, this isn't the place.  But that's not to say that it's noisy, either.  As a matter of fact, besides the noise you might expect from outside, it almost seemed as if there were only a few people staying at the hotel. The free internet was nice, but I did have some problems with it.  The signal was intermittent, so at times my screen would freeze when loading or refreshing.  It would definitely be nice if wireless was available throughout the hotel. USA Today is available on weekdays, but don't expect it on your doorstep.  I like a leisurely morning where I can relax and read the paper in the morning, so I was just a tad disappointed when the first morning I found out I had to pick up the paper at the front desk. A couple times, I had problems with my key card and had to get it reset.  Again, a minor convenience. Considering the location and what the hotel offers, I would say that overall staying at The Silversmith is a great value.  If you don't need the features of the bigger hotels offer and don't insist on modern decor, this may be one of the best hotels in the area in terms of value.",4
845,"I'm writing this review early-  I just checked in- because I'm so wowed by this hidden gem already! I posted photos-- such a homey feeling in the rooms!! VERY spacious for a downtown property, although I keep forgetting Chicago is not like NYC and San Fran in that respect. I'm a local- but I live in the burbs. I'm downtown for a conference and the hotel where the conference is was sold out, so I looked on TripAdvisor and Yelp to see about this hotel-- and wow! I've walked by here a million times probably and never noticed! How wrong I was! They have free Wi-Fi- which works like a charm - great speed. 24 hour Fitness Center (haven't checked out yet - will update later) and Biz Center. They have a restaurant in the building that opens at 6:30am- will report back later on that as well. This feels more like a very nice apartment than a hotel-- I'm so impressed and the rate we had was VERY REASONABLE.. Will update my review upon checkout but so far- I'm very impressed!!!!  Update: The bed, while roomy and with great sheets and pillows does NOT have a good mattress. Very old and stiff and creaky. Bummer. It was ok to sleep in but if they replaced the mattresses this would be perfecto! Now- I ordered breakfast this morning. I give it 2 stars. Mediocre-- not BAD mind you but nothing yummy. I only got 2 eggs scrambled with toast and coffee but Ho-Hum. For lunch I got a fruit plate- EXCELLENT EXCELLENT and with a fresh bran muffin and yogurt. They deliver FAST here in under 15 minutes which is remarkable. More later!",4
846,"Silversmith was a perfectly acceptable hotel in the middle of Chicago's downtown and a short walk from Millenium and Grant Parks.  You cannot beat the location.  However, for a ""boutique hotel"", I was expecting more.  The lobby was kind of strange... all wood with their ""business center"" (2 computers) and their gym which was pretty sorry looking. Our room was very dark since we were directly facing another building.  That being said, the room was immaculate, the staff was friendly and the beds were comfortable. This was completely serviceable, however it didn't seem very ""boutique hotel""-ish to me.  I'm not sure if they should try to sell themselves as that.  Either way, it was affordable and worth it for the location alone.",3
847,"We stayed here for 5 nights and my overall experience was great! I booked a room with 2 doubles. When we got there, the didn't have any available and gave me a 1-bedroom suite. The bathroom was huge with a separate shower and tub. The rest of the suite was pretty spacious too. There was a sofa pullout and the bed king-sized. Our room was next to the L-train, but it didn't bother any of us during the night. Everyone that worked there was very curteous and helpful. They greeted us when we would leave and greeted us when we returned. The location was pretty convenient. It was 2 blocks away from Milleneum Park and at the end of Michigan Avenue, which is part of the Magnifent Mile. There were plenty of shops and restaurants around the hotel. A great place to stay!",4
848,"This place and http://hotels.com totally screwed me. Booked and paid for room Oct. 12 and received confirmation. Got e-mail 6 p.m. on Nov. 15, the date I had booked, saying there was a problem. http://Hotels.com said Silversmith had overbooked. Both Silversmith and http://hotels.com said they would help find another room. Never heard back from Silversmith; http://hotels.com said closest is 30 miles. I have a meeting 2 blocks from Silversmith at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow. No car, unfamiliar with transit system. Will never ever do business with either again. Anyone who does risks same treatment.",1
849,"We blocked off rooms for our wedding guests at the Silversmith. Not only did they give us a great rate (especially considering the location) at $169 per night, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. We assembled our wedding flowers day-of in a conference room they provided for us. Our suites were quite spacious. Our guests couldn't speak more highly of how nice the bellhops were and how centrally located the hotel was. Nothing too fancy here though - TVs are very 1998, no gadgets or extras.",4
850,"Excellent value for the money.  Price was easily $50-$100 less than comparable hotels. Location was outstanding, right on the doorstep of the el. Staff was friendly and accommodating.  Housekeeping was good, concierge did her best to be helpful (Peggy) but maybe didn't quite hear what it is that we were interested in.  Perhaps because we didn't fit the demo of what was in the hotel at the time. I'd definitely recommend it to the budget traveller who wanted to be in the middle of it all and not stay in a fleabag motel. My only gripe would be what others have said-no coffee maker in the rooms.  Tough to go down to the lobby in PJ's and grab one and the time frame negates sleeping in.",4
851,"Camped out here a few days over Thanksgiving.  Staff was friendly and accommodating, room was just fine and overlooked a lovely brick wall (eh, not a deal breaker for me) ... but the interweb connection at this place was incredibly slow.  It was as though I was nine again and impatiently waiting for dial up connection so I could do important things like visit the Ty website and look at Beanie Baby paraphernalia.  Right.  But there was the most amazing vintage typewriter in the lobby, I wished it was as easy to take as little bottles of hotel shampoo.",3
852,"five stars for the location - heart of the Loop and just a short walk to Millennium Park, the Art Institute and shopping.   one star for noise insulation - wanna be awakened to the sound of someone showering or  flushing a toilet at 3AM?  Stay here.   The staff is friendly enough. and the rooms are drably but comfortably furnished.  but for over $200 per night, I expect a robe - a necessity when answering the door for room service.",2
853,"We stayed at this hotel for NYE.  I was pleasantly surprised at how spacious our room was.  It was cozy and comfortable and our bathroom was newly remodeled.  Great location, just blocks from Millenium Park and steps away from State St. and Michigan Ave. We will definitely stay there again.",4
854,"Great value.  Extra spacious suite, great for busy kids and parents that like a little privacy.  Very clean with friendly staff.  Close to lots of stuff.  I would certainly bring my family here again.",4
855,"The location is what makes this hotel. I came to the city for a long weekend and wanted a place that would be central to the Art Institute and to Mag Mile shopping.  I am always baffled by the world of Chicago hotels, in which my options  seem to narrow to either a $600/night room at the Fairmont, or a Travelodge experience where I'm taking my life in my hands (but oh, so cheap!). The Silversmith hotel fills this void in the travel landscape serviceably, if not memorably. I'm not convinced I'd stay here again.I almost feel that if I'd had more lead time, that I could have found a nicer room elsewhere at a recognized hotel chain.  The Silversmith's rooms, although spacious, lack some of the more thoughtful appointments (to wit: the shower had only one slot for soap and the selection of toiletries could have been amplified as there was no showercap, shower gel, or hair conditioner). The decor was a bit of a hodgepodge--almost as though someone decided to clean out their storage closets/rec rooms in a bid to quickly furnish this hotel. The rooms did have a fridge and microwave, however, a boon for the budget-conscious or time-strapped traveler (especially with CVS at the ready). The hotel has a gym and business center and the bellmen are good about checking luggage and hailing cabs, which is always a plus.",3
856,"I stayed here in April 2008, and it was really beautiful. I've been in many hotels throughout my life spanning from cheapies to luxe. I've also had experience in real estate, enough to know when a place is in good, clean shape and has great fixtures (I can't help but notice the little things). The ceilings were wonderfully high and the complimentary desserts in the lobby truly blew my mind. Amazing! I've paid three times the price for ""luxury"" hotels in Las Vegas that weren't even as nice as this. It is noisy if you sleep in a room beside the L train, but I stayed on the opposite side and slept peacefully. I'm coming back here some day!",5
857,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the Silversmith. Got a really nice and well-appointed suite-type room on the 8th floor toward the center of the hotel with tall windows. Luckily, the windows were not in the front where the elevated CTA trains run. The hotel was upgrading guests to king suites, and the suite and bathroom were very spacious and tastefully decorated in a masculine classic style: 2 closets, french doors, 2 televisions, upholstered window bench, and loveseat. No noise issues, and housekeeping was also respectful of the 'do not disturb' sign. I actually used the business center computer, which was fast and seemed virus-free, and had the front desk send a fax for me without any hassle or charge. Hotel is really conveniently located 2.5 blocks from the blue line (O'Hare) and right next to other loop trains. It is also about a block from Millenium Park (one of the main reasons to stay here) and Michigan Ave shops. Fantastic location and value for the price! You get the boutique feel with understated elegance.",5
858,"Besides the wall paper and that's not really important, I can't think of anything bad to say. Staying over the New Years holiday I picked this hotel and the ""L' is really about 20 feet to the left of the front door. You're only seconds from going anywhere you want in town. My room was at the front of the hotel and I didn't find the noise of the train to bother me at all. The staff was very friendly, and the room was extremely clean (I cleaned rooms in a former life so I'm picky). I plan on using this hotel again when I come back and the price was such a bargain for the room and the parking, that it makes it hard for me not to use them again. If you like older hotels with charm then I suggest this one, but if you looking for water parks with in room electronic activities then this is not your hotel.",4
859,Awesome suite upgrade with yelp checkin!,5
860,"Great place to stay! Got the free room upgrade with the yelp checkin. Front desk staff very friendly. Very clean sheets and comfortable. Rooms are very relaxing, as well as lobby. Made me feel right at home. Very good central location.",4
861,"Stayed here for a brief Christmas get-away with my son and was very pleasantly surprised. #1 is the staff. From the doorman, to bellman, to desk clerk-- each and every one was above and beyond in courtesy and professionalism. I've stayed at many five star hotels and this staff is second to none. The hotel itself is cute on the inside. I was initially concerned because it's right on the el tracks, but once inside, didn't notice the sound unless I was specifically listening for it. The room was lovely. We had a suite with a king bedroom. The bathroom is enormous. Everything looked new and clean. (FYI, the suite has a double door between the living area and sleeping area, but the wall doesn't go all the way to the ceiling. I think it's to help air circulation. Since my son was on the sofa bed, this was a bit of a concern, but the sound was still muted between the two areas, so you can watch tv without disturbing little ones with early bed times.) There was a mini fridge in the room. The lobby is lovely, but the bar is in the diner restaurant on the first level. I inquired and the desk clerk told me it's fine to bring cocktails from the restaurant to the lobby. I'd recommend that. The restaurant serves comfort food. Nothing outstanding. Location is excellent. Walking distance to everything. A terrific value. We'll go there again.",4
862,"The Crowne Plaza Silversmith is a classy hotel in the Loop, across from the Jewelers Row area. The comfortable interiors are reminiscent of the Prairie Style of architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Its main facade does face the ""L"" tracks, so you may get a good view but also an earful in the evening. Ada's is a decent downtown deli.",4
863,"I stayed here for one night on recommendation from my manager, who knows the area well.  The location was convenient, the rooms were well kept/clean/huge/comfy/quiet....more like a suite....the bar did what it needed to do, the service was delightful; overall the experience for a business class hotel (with a bit of personality) at $125 a night, blocks from everywhere I needed to be was wonderful.  Only, bring your shampoo if you're a lady.  Beware: they only offer the shampoo/conditioner combo option which means super bad hair day for important meetings the next day. :(",4
864,"Stayed here one night to be close to a family event. Great location, clean, really comfortable bed, large room with little living room area. We didn't use the TVs but they do need to upgrade them. Staff was pleasant if not overly enthusiastic. Gym was adequate, although if I'd gone in during early morning hours it probably wouldn't have been, with only 2 treadmills & a handful of other machines. For a first-time visit to Chicago this hotel would be great, since it's walking distance to what you want to see and the price, at least on http://hotels.com, was very good.",4
865,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights with another couple this past weekend, and overall our experience was very good. The location of the hotel can't be beat, as it's on Jeweler's Row at the corner of Madison and Wabash; easy to get to and within walking distance to TONS of places, including the Amtrak station, Grant Park, and Michigan Avenue. Taxis, buses, and the El train are all very accessible as well, so getting just about anywhere is a breeze. Even better are the shops and restaurants just outside the front door, making it very easy to find anything you may need during your stay. The hotel itself is ""old world"" in style/decor, but the amenities are definitely modern: high-speed internet access, a roomy, updated bathroom, and a powerful AC unit are all worth mentioning. The rooms are on the small side, but that's to be expected given the hotel's downtown location. The only complaint I have about the room is regarding the beds, which were rock-hard. This is pretty typical for hotels nowadays, though, so I wasn't too surprised; it was just the only thing that kept the experience from being 5-star. FYI, our bed was king-sized. I've read there are some people who were bothered by the noise of the El train, which passes right outside the hotel. The key to this is to get a room at the back of the hotel, away from the street. That's what we did, and the noise was barely noticeable; it just sounded like it was raining whenever the train passed by. It's MUCH louder when you're facing the street, though, including when standing in the lobby. Just something to keep in mind when booking. Another thing to note is that the hotel does have several adjoining rooms. This was not something I remembered reading anywhere, so I thought I'd mention it; we would have taken advantage of that had we known about it. The staff was very accommodating and friendly, allowing us to check in early (around 1:30pm) and storing our bags after we'd checked out. They were also happy to accommodate our requests for change (bus fare), directions, and a move to the aforementioned adjoining rooms. (They weren't able to move us due to other bookings, but they were very nice about it!) We would absolutely stay here again and recommend the hotel to others.",4
866,"This is a great little place near the theatre district. We came in for Jersey Boys and was a block away. Great front desk personnel. Ended up staying an addtional night at the same low rate of $89.00. We definitely will stay again...conveinent, clean & comfertable. Three rooms were booked an all were great...",4
867,"My usual stay in a hotel rarely requires any contact with the front desk other then checking in.  This time we were asked to wait for the room we booked or check in right away into a downgraded room.  We decided to wait for our room.  When we returned, they had a different front desk person on duty and a different story, take it or leave it.  We basically waited for a room that didn't materialize wasting our precious time while on a short vacation.  No apology.  Non existent customer service.",1
868,"Large, very clean, new enough decor, staid new mission style decor but not too overdone. Solid and tasteful enough. Good architecture. Mostly nice, professional and informed staff. The wireless internet works well and fast. In-room single-serve Starbucks. Wake-up call gives weather. Good linens but hard thick pillows, they need new ones. Nicer than comparable hotels in SF. Not shabby. I could hear the trains but was far enough away that it sounded pleasant like a wave--ask for a back room if you hate noise. Very downtown Chicago atmosphere but not chaotic or overly commercial, near the Art Institute. Interior room had view of courtyard/walls but nice windows (not openable), good light. You can regulate your room's digital thermostat.  I would have given it a 4 except for a few flukes. My bathroom ceiling leaked (I was under the roof air conditioner) and it smelled damp and was always too cold despite my changing the temperature. There was a panel cut in the bathroom ceiling probably to fix this leak previously, the water dripped in around it. Obviously this room has a moisture problem from that. They moved me graciously and the new room was great. The second morning my coffee maker spurted the water it heated spurted all over, and when I called the desk to ask for a replacement I was told there were no rooms left therefore no more coffee makers and I would have to go get my own coffee in the restaurant as the staff had not arrived (6:30am). No spare at the front desk? Big hotel for no night staff. I managed to fix it myself--when it was cleaned the hosing was disconnected.",3
869,"I left a marvelous hotel to come here and I am overjoyed at the choice. A natural pick for architect buffs,it's on the tour! The staff is unreal in every way. Suze is a standout! U of m grad and rower loving the Midwest values. Apparently the manger is a Michigan guy as well but State oh we'll :) The rooms are perfect! Elegant,unique,comfortable,lovely. All the way down to the hand sewn blanket with velvet. They even have footies! Free Starbucks in the AM. This is where I will stay on all upcoming visits!  Pet friendly and interesting guests. It's a small place and private.",5
870,"This hotel has a special place in my heart as my now fiancé and I stayed here the weekend we got engaged.  I chose this hotel because I got the impression from other reviews that it was both classy and cozy with a great location.  We were fortunate enough to get a corner suite with a view of the Chicago theatre on one side and Millennium Park on the other.  The room was tastefully decorated in blue and gold tones (with a somewhat regal feel).  In terms of hospitality, the staff knocked it out of the park.  Among other things, the hand-written note and complimentary bottle of champagne were very nice. If I had to nitpick I would say the gym is limited and the lobby is a little cramped (although to be fair, it is relatively small hotel to begin with).  Also, I have slept on more comfortable beds.  However, the free papers (including the NYTimes) and coffee in the lobby made up for it.   If one wants to experience classic décor such as marble stairwells and crown moldings with outstanding hospitality, then I highly recommend this hotel.",5
871,"This hotel was ideal for my stay -- great staff, beautiful rooms, and a great location.  And keys!  Real keys like the ones you have on your keychain!  I'm not sure why that had such a big impact on me, but it did.  Nice view of the Trump Tower from my room.  Great restaurants and Millennium Park within easy walking distance.  My room wasn't huge, but it didn't need to be -- great work Kimpton.",5
872,"I'm a sucker for old-world charm and was drawn to the Hotel Burnham after seeing photos online of the historic building and exquisite interior.  I booked a king lake view suite after reading reviews that the normal rooms were quite small, plus I really wanted a view, which is something that Chicago hotels know and will absolutely charge you for.  It was a bit more than I would have liked to pay but I kinda said ""screw it, I want to experience this place"" and I'm glad I did.  I knew I'd made the right choice when they handed me a REAL key not a stupid key card (which in my experience are faulty or need recoding 50% of the time). The picture windows are lovely; I was staying on the 12th floor with a view down state street out of one window and the park and lake out of the other.  Great for random people-watching too: I even caught a glimpse of a newly-married couple taking wedding photographs in the middle of the street down a few blocks in front of the Chicago theater! What made this stay particularly memorable was the exceptional service.  Staff members went out of their way to ensure I had a pleasant experience.  In the lobby there is a wine social hour in the evening and fresh-brewed coffee in the morning (which I didn't realize when I asked the hotel to bring me a coffee maker the night before - oops!)  Prior to my arrival, I got a personal email from Suze, who checked in with me to ask about my room preferences, if I wanted them to book me a dinner reservation anywhere, and inquire about if I was celebrating any special occasions or had additional requests.  I was in fact celebrating an acceptance into grad school, let them know this, and there was a little bouquet of flowers with a congratulatory card awaiting me in the room.  I was also traveling with my infant daughter who is one, and had asked for a crib in the room - it was already made up and waiting for me when I arrived.  Also worth noting is I showed up in the morning way before check-in time, but the room was all ready set up and ready to go, which was a  nice surprise.  I really appreciate that the staff connects with its guests before they arrive - so many places just send out an impersonal automated email generated by their bookings page, and it was nice to know an actual human was taking care of me. The pictures don't do this place justice.  The building, the lobby, the staircases, elevators, and my room were all just breathtaking.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat if it weren't so expensive!",5
873,"Me: ""I stayed at a Kimpton Hotel"". Typical reaction: ""What is that? A Marriott, Hilton, Starwood Hotel?"" For those who don't know, Kimpton is chain of 100 boutique hotels that are located in most of the major metropolitan cities in America and no, they are not associated with any of the major hotel brands.   In the hypercompetitive hotel service industry, I really think that there are only a few things that a hotel can do to stand out.  One, the hotel creates a once in a lifetime experience by charging an astronomical price (say...overwater bungalows in Bora Bora) or goes the bargain/cheap route for the price conscientious customer.  For most, anything in-between seems to be an experience that is soon be forgotten unless you are tied into a loyalty/reward system that makes you go back to a hotel chain. So what makes Kimpton hotels stand out? Simple.  They provide 5* service at realistic price points for consumers.   FACT: They have the highest customer satisfaction scores and emotional attachment scores of all hotel chains operating in the United States. How so? Service: 1)  As I checked into my room, I had a hand written ""welcome back"" card that specifically stated that they hope I enjoy my second visit.  I visited Kimpton 4 months ago for the first time, and they pulled this info and prepared for my visit before I checked in. Amazing. 2)  They called 10 min after I got into my room to see if I needed anything. 3)  Three to four hours later, an employee brings me a complimentary bottle of Chianti.  Unfortunately I could not have this b/c I had some important things to do the following day so he asked if he could bring me anything else to drink like juice or lemonade.  In 5 minutes, he brought me complimentary ""fresh-squeezed"" lemonade.  Madness. Perks: 1) $10 bonus perk card for loyalty program members for every stay.  You can spend the $10 on anything in the fridge and in the snacks cabinet.  They have organic snacks, coke, beer, wine, chips, chocolate bars, you name it.  Although they are a bit overpriced, you can pick out 2-4 things without paying a dime.  Hey you can't complain b/c it's free :) 2) Rotating loss-leader specials.  For example, the Kimpton hotel chain is now offering 2 cocktails for $1 at the bar until the end of your stay.  Yeah.  Tell me a hotel chain that does that. 3) Complimentary starbucks coffee in the morning and wine and champagne in the afternoon (at the lobby). 4) Free wifi by being a loyalty program member.  This comes in handy in large metropolitan cities where all hotels charge for wifi. Add all these perks to a great bed that rivals the Westin's Heavenly Bed and fantastic decor to boot at around ~$110 a night.  It is almost impossible to find this kind of deal anywhere. The service and the quality of my stays has made me reconsider my priceline bidding strategies in the cities where Kimpton Hotels are located.  For a marginal difference of $20-$30, I am not so sure that the price difference warrants my risking landing an unproven hotel using priceline. As much as the service may not sound ""phenomenal"" for my review, my general feeling is that they would have gone completely out of their way and would have done outrageous things to make me happy.  I was sold.  Kimpton you won a loyal customer and a well-deserved 5* review!",5
874,"My wife and I spent a few days at the Burnham last week as part of our annual pre-Spring Break spring break.  We couldn't have enjoyed it more. With a location close to just about everything, friendly and accommodating staff, wonderful rooms (we stayed on the 11th floor where the view included just a bit of the lake between the buildings on Washington), not to mention the history surrounding the building, we had a thoroughly relaxing and restorative stay. Having the Atwood Cafe on site in the lobby was a definite plus as we had breakfast each day, cocktails and dinner on our last evening.  See my review elsewhere on Yelp.",4
875,Stayed here for the weekend when I went to visit a friend in Chicago for my birthday. The interior of the hotel is lovely. Wrought iron. Dark wood. Fabrics in blues and golds. I had a room on the 8th floor which had a great view of Chicago and felt like my own mini office away from my office. Kimptons service was excellent as usual--right down to the wine. Many thanks Hotel Burnham!,4
876,"Darnell at the front desk was friendly, and offered dinner recommendations when he saw me with fast food. He told me that the gold fish at the front desk is known by a different name by different employees. Darnell called that fish, Nemo. Service was excellent, and I love that they offer Mighty Leaf teas. The metal tea is a fun, vintage touch. When my tub wasn't draining, a quick call, and they had it fixed while I was out. The location is great for shopping and restaurants in the Loop. The reason why I'm not giving it more stars is because my personal preferences are for more modern interiors, and a more spacious room. For my hotel rate, I was expecting the Palomar.",3
877,"We very much enjoyed our stay here over the weekend.  We were put on a lower floor at our request ( we like to take the stairs ) with a very nice view of the corner of State and Washington.  The room had high ceilings, huge windows, and did not feel cramped at all.  It really is a beautifully restored building. The location cannot be beat, at least for our purposes: close to both the Blue and Red lines and a couple blocks from the Metra station and Millenium Park, it's right in the middle of everything. The staff was without exception friendly, enthusiastic and accommodating.  They have a wine hour for guests from 5-6pm which featured a selection of two wines from California and a very nice sangria the night we attended.  They also have an assortment of coffee and tea available in the lobby in the mornings.  We did not try the lobby restaurant, but observed that the bar seems to close kind of early for a hotel bar. Wireless is free if you sign up for their affinity program, which we did.  At least in our room, though the signal was plenty strong, the connection seemed very slow even for the purposes of checking e-mail. Overall, it's a comfortable, upscale place to stay in a convenient location, and I thought I got a very good value for the rate I paid.  When we are next in Chicago, we'll definitely be looking up the Hotel Burnham again.",4
878,"Old World charm + great customer service = Hotel Burnham It's in the heart of the city (the Loop, none the less!) and close to the CTA's Blue and Red Line trains (both are less than a block away) which offers easy access to the rest of the city. Before you run off to book, check it: become a Klimpton InTouch member. This will definitely add slight, but appreciated, personal touches to your stay. Plus, you get a free 10$ gift card to raid their mini bar for doing this. I used it to nab a few snacks for my flight home. I notified them that I was checking in early and when I got there (around 4pm), I was able to get my picking of available rooms which included staying on their top floor: BINGO. The upper levels are maintained historically accurate to when the hotel opened in the late 1800's. Check out the old marble staircase; you can even see foot grooves on the steps! My room's window was huge! It felt like I was looking out in HD; everything was so crisp and clear. The room's size wasn't very big (reminded me of European hotels), yet we never felt claustrophobic probably due to the big windows and high ceiling. Also, we didn't stay in a hotel in the heart of Chicago to stay in and sleep the night away! The cleaning and reception staff were all very attentive and proper whenever I interacted with them. The hotel offers a bunch of stuff for free beyond the regular, complimentary soap, shampoo and conditioner. I borrowed a hair straightener (very clean!) and clothes steamer for FREE! Maybe this is something other places do, but I've never known of it.   If you're into history, you'll like this place even more once you find out more about this hotel and who it's named after.",4
879,"Top notch, very fast and efficient customer service by the whole staff(except for the restaurant). By the time we put the phone down for a request there was a knock at the door accommodating our needs.  Staff was very eager to please. The room we had had maintenance problems. Shower adjuster fell off when I tried to turn it for some much needed water pressure. Phones did not work and the bathroom walls were in need of serious cleaning. Enjoyed the stay and felt that our business was appreciated.",4
880,"Fabulous stay. Very friendly staff, great views of downtown, centrally located.",5
881,"Stayed here last weekend and found every aspect of Hotel Burnham to be great.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The people at the front desk were genuinely nice and very helpful.  They printed out tickets to the cubs game for me, gave out an umbrella when it rained, helped us with a voucher for Atwoods.  The staff was excellent.  I felt like we got a great deal on the 2 night stay especially for everything that was included - as part of a promotion we received $50 to use at Atwoods and a free continental breakfast on Labor Day as Atwoods wasn't open.  We took advantage of the wine hour 1 of the days and that was nice. The location is excellent.  There is a lot to do within walking distance and if the places you are going are a bit farther away there are several options for hopping on the L.  Very convenient for getting to/from Midway airport as well.  Would definitely stay here again.",5
882,"You can't do better than the Burnham for excellent service and accommodations.  From the moment you arrive, you're in for a treat as they literally make you feel relaxed, at home and without a care.  Emil, Suze, Darnell, Liz, Ben; nicest people you could know; Ray is a terrific bartender, and Vane excels at all he does. Coming back for the NATO Summit in May, should have made reservations by now.  But Jack Marvin, the Front Desk Manager, says, just email me, we'll take care of it. Can't get better than the Burnham!",5
883,"Stayed here for work via booking on http://Hotels.com.  Hotel is very cool, great staff like what seems like all Kimpton Hotels.  The room was tidy, loved that they had Aveda bath products.  Room was small, but had a really interesting view into the neighboring apartment building.  Check in and out was smooth.  I did not eat at the restaurant as iI was on the hunt for 3Floyds and they didn't have any there.  WiFi is free if you are a Kimpton rewards member, which is awesome.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",4
884,"I stayed in the Burnham while I was in Chicago for a conference. It's a small, boutique hotel owned by the great chain Kimpton. All the Kimpton hotels I've stayed at have been lovely and the Burnham is no exception. Rooms are decent sized for such a small hotel. I happened to get the handicap accessible room so my bathroom was oversized (NICE!). Good water pressure and and nice toiletries. Big flat screen TV and a mini-bar. Towels and linens were good quality and the bed was very comfortable. My room faced the street and you could definitely hear the city sounds so if you don't like honking and such, ask for an interior room. But interior rooms have no view and I was able to watch the city speed by, which I like. There is a restaurant attached and while I didn't eat there, I did get a glass of wine both nights. The menu looks very nice. There is also a nice manager's happy hour in the evening if you would like a glass of wine. I would recommend the Burnham highly. It was in close proximity and walking distance of the river, Miracle Mile, and Millenium Park and museums. A great location!",5
885,"Yeah, this place rocked. It's a small boutique-style place right near the theater district. I walked around happily with this as my home base. There's a great comic store nearby, theaters, all types of shops, and many restaurants. Inside, my room was nice, and they did a great job with my dry cleaning - surprising, actually. Better than my home dry cleaner. One pet peeve of mine is hotels who say they have free wireless access but fail to have enough bandwidth to support the customers. My first day there, I watched a lot of content via their in-house wireless, but the second day I got blocked out constantly. Don't know whether it's their network or the source, but I suspect it was theirs. Still, I will overlook that and still give them a 5, because not having service got me off my butt and outside into the sunshine, which isn't all bad, is it?",5
886,"I stayed here for a long weekend in May '10 last year. It is a beautiful, historic, boutique hotel and I was quite impressed when we first arrived. Another plus was the free wine in the lobby (which is absolutely beautiful and comfortable) every day between 4-6pm (I think). Also I thought the nightly rates were very reasonable for the wonderful location. Unfortunately, everyone can have different experiences in the same establishment, and if we had been in another room or another floor it could have been a 5 star experience. BUT, the toilet in our room exploded and flooded the ENTIRE hotel room while we were gone (Thank God) due to a plumbing issue in their building. It was disgusting. They moved us to another room (and most of our stuff thankfully stayed dry). To apologize to us they took our home address and promised to send a lovely basket or something. NEVER CAME. Also they didn't knock off any $$ for the stay. They gave us a certificate for one free drink at their bar, but that was it. Doesn't that seem like bad service? Our stuff got wet when a toilet exploded in their hotel room! I'm going back to Chicago this weekend (and go back very frequently), and I'm not planning on staying there again, but it was a pretty hotel in a great location.",2
887,"When this hotel says they are pet friendly, it is such an understatement! We were travelling with my kitten and the staff could not have been more accommodating. Not only is there no pet fee here, but they actually have pet supplies if you are unable to travel with them. For my kitten, they supplied us with a litter box and pet bed and even watched her for us free of charge in the downstairs back office while we attended a business meeting! On top of being beautiful hotel in the center of EVERYTHING downtown Chicago has to offer, the rooms were classicly beautiful and the staff was beyond friendly. I would highly recommend it!",5
888,"It was one of my first architectural discoveries in Chicago. I fell in deep love with the wrought iron staircase, the mosaic floor and the detailed elevator doors. That was 5 years ago. I live in Chicago and so needed a good occasion to stay in one of the rooms. I got married!!! (what's this for a plan?) We had the reception at the Reliance Room and were appointed to a complimentary suite for our wedding night. I loved it. The location is just unbeatable and the views.....incredible.... We decided right there and then to spend every anniversary night in that room and I can't wait for the first one!",5
889,"The marble walls and ceiling and the ornamental metal elevator grills of the Hotel Burnham will be impressive to the architect in your life, should you choose to take him along on your stay here. He'll appreciate this adaptive reuse of a historic landmark. It's even on the National Trust's Historic Hotels of America register! And spacious rooms ensure that you won't trip over one another. I even managed to get several hours of work done at the desk during my stay, which is not usually the case at cramped in-room desks. The location is excellent. In the short time I had between my arrival and when I had to be at work I managed to visit Millennium Park, take a picture with the bean and find a dress and shoes for a wedding I had to go to that weekend. Any frequent Kimpton Hotel guest will come to know their nightly wine hour. But the Hotel Burnham doesn't just offer red and white wine, they also offer Cracker Jack! Staff here goes the extra mile - spending nearly half an hour trying to hail cabs for customers stranded in the rain, always greeting guests with genuine smiles. The Hotel Burnham would be my top choice for a stay, be it work or pleasure, in Chicago.",5
890,"The Hotel Burnham lets you step back into a bit of 19th century old world charm while still providing some of the more modern conveniences. The restoration job Kimpton has done on Daniel Burnham's 1895 predecessor to today's skyscraper is truly wonderful. I was much happier staying at this little boutique hotel this past week on my business trip than one of the other big name neighbors. Its ideally located to all that the Loop offers. If given a choice - I'll be back here again when staying in Chicago. From the moment you walk into the dark wood reception area with its quaint little sitting area, you are greeted by smiling faces eager to make your stay a success. Like most other Kimpton properties they offer an evening wine reception and have a generous pet policy. It pays to be a member of their Kimpton In Touch program (free) as you get free internet access, $10 mini-bar credit and free continental breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. A couple of tips for this particular location: - You will get an actual key to your room. At first I loved concept this antiquated concept, hearkening back to a simpler time. But after a week of the key jingling in my pocket and trying not to lose the darn thing - I think I'd rather leave this part of history behind and have the added security of modern key cards. - There aren't hairdryers in the rooms (at least in mine) but they will bring one up to you. - Rooms are a little small. Try to get at least a queen or king room - at 5.4 my footsies were hanging off the double bed unless I scrunched all the way up on my pillows. Issue solved by sleeping diagonally - but the larger bed would have been nice. - Request an upper floor room. I was the 5th floor overlooking Washington and State, but I could still hear quite a bit of noise from the street and ""L"". Didn't keep me from sleeping well though.",4
891,"Loved it! Staff was accomodating and friendly.  Hotel was a beautiful renovation of the Reliance Building--rooms on the 8th floor retain the original frosted glass office doors, replicas of the original metal grillwork in the halls and elevators. Ask for a room on a higher floor--there's some serious construction going on across the street. Also--free wine between 5 and 6--hard to argue with that.",5
892,"I was prepared to love Burnham Hotel. Being from San Francisco I was well aware of the Kimpton boutique hotel experience but... I walked into the lobby through a rathr ghetto underwhelming awning that needed an update.  It revealed none of the glamour that envelops you when you enter the lobby. Glorious red, wood, and marble transport you to another time. I walked into my room using an old fashioned key with a pendant emblazoned with their signature Celtic armor/motif that repeats throughout the hotel...  Only to find a woman brushing her teeth in her bras!  Clearly I've been assigned the wrong room!  Ok a fluke...  Not a big deal. My new room was located on the 5th floor with a view of Washington street.  No woman in bras but I was greeted by beautiful yellow wallpaper, fancy electronics and striking blue and white room scheme. I nestled into my bed, and cozied with a beer and organic kettle chips from the honor bar. I had a all day meeting starting at 6 a very important that I get good sleep.  So far so good Except I was woken up at night constantly by the sound of construction of a new building across the street. It was a jackhammer (are jackhammers allowed at that time of day??!!)  what was more  perplexing is that a lot of rooms faced Washington. Am I the only one who couldn't sleep through the noise?   Travelers beware. I love this hotel but please ask for a room away from Washington if you want sleep!",2
893,"Hotel Burnham is one of the Kimpton's more interesting hotels - maybe not as luxurious as the Palomar, but a lot more character than the Allergro.     I only stayed here one night, but the staff was very helpful and everything seemed well kept and quiet.",4
894,"Architecture defines the ""boutique hotel"" experience. Staff extremely friendly and accomodating.  I left some items in my room, and hotel staff went out of their way to find these items and ship them to me.  All the while, they kept me updated by phone. In-hotel dining (Atwood) is of quality. The room itself was beautiful,  corner windows overlooking the busy Chicago streetscape. This would make a great place for a couples getaway.  I would stay here again and recommend the hotel highly.",5
895,"I loved staying here. The beds were comfy, the staff incredibly nice and attentive, and the location? A few blocks from millenium park, kitty corner to the picasso, and less than a block from a jimmy john's. update -- I STILL loved stayed here. While it's a great summer location, it's also a fantastic winter location. Walking along michigan ave in the snow is beautiful. Oh! and on a return visit I got a hand written note welcoming us back. Great nice little touches.",5
896,"The hotel is right in the heart of Chicago. Perfect location. It's on the corner of State Street and Washington. A couple blocks one way is Millennium Park. A couple blocks the other way is the Chicago River. A short walk away from the Art Institute. A couple blocks away from Metro and bus stops. Making the entire city easily accessible. The hotel room was great. We asked from a room facing State Street when we checked in because there is some construction across Washington. We got an end room on the 12th floor. Great view down Washington toward Millennium Park and also down State Street toward the Chicago River, with a view of the Chicago Theater. The room was a modest size. The bathroom was nice. One thing that we found amusing was that the shower head was about 6-7 inches above my head, and I'm 6'3"". That hardly ever happens. The fitness room was small. Not much to it. There are two treadmills, one elliptical, one bike, and a set of free weights. It was a means to get our workout done. There are water and towels provided. The hotel restaurant was one of the better reviewed restaurants in the city. Some thing we didn't expect. I was recommended to eat at the Atwood Cafe and upon looking it up, I discovered it was at our hotel. The food was very good. Reservations are recommended. You can make those easily through http://opentable.com. Overall, we had a great trip to Chicago. And we feel this was due in large part to the hotel experience. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. You can't beat the location and service. And if you keep your eyes open for deals, you can stay here for a great price.",5
897,"Two things really stand out at Burnham: its location and its ambiance. The hotel is located at State and Washington, and the view down State Street from our corner room on the 12th floor was awesome! During the Christmas season, the hotel is right across from Macy's and a block away from the Chicago Christmas tree. It's a couple blocks from Michigan Ave. and Millennium Park. So, walking around right out of the hotel was great and then catching a cab was trivial as well. It's a max $10 cab ride to pretty much anywhere, for example, Lincoln Park. The ambiance is boutique: small and casual. The service isn't snooty or smothering. The lobby is tiny with a fireplace and a couple comfy chairs. Our room was a suite but was still smaller than a more modern hotel. That was fine; it was a great setup and the windows on a corner room were huge. And yes, Burnham has the practicalities down as well... comfy beds and good shower/water pressure. The room had two robes in the closet a leopard pattern and a zebra. Ha! My only complaint... the tiny bar and cafe downstairs were hard to get into. We didn't make reservations for Sunday brunch at Atwood and couldn't get in. So be it! Of course, staying at a downtown hotel ain't cheap, but I think Burnham is a little less than a lot of other options. Highest rating for the Burnham Hotel!",5
898,"My folks (and sometimes I) always stay here when they are up in the Chicago area. Nestled in downtown Chicago (and basically across the street from Macy's for all you shoppers), this is a great place to stay, unwind, have a drink, or grab some dinner. The Burnham is more of a boutiquey type hotel with a lot of quirky nuances. The decor is very Algonquin Circlesque (I know that isn't a word, but whatev) due to the fact that it used to be an office building from the 40s-50s. The rooms are cozy and the service is fantastic :) Also, they are pet friendly so feel free to bring along your trusty travelling sidekick!!!! Bonus: They offer a free wine hour for all their guests at, I believe, around 5pm for most (if not all) nights :) A great way to unwind after a long and eventful day in the city!!!",5
899,"I stayed at the Burnham on my fifth trip to Chicago in the last couple years. I have stayed at a different four-star hotel on each visit. The Burnham was probably my favorite of the bunch.   The staff was extremely helpful and friendly, and the location can't be beat. Right on the corner of State and Washington with very easy access to the Red and Blue lines. When they finish the new building at 108 N. State there will be a new Blue line station and new access to the Orange line. That means the Burnham will have easy access to either airport. After reading ""The Devil in the White City"" I was very interested in seeing some of Burnham and Root's (& Atwood's) work first hand.  To have the opportunity to stay in one of their buildings was incredible. The Reliance Building is absolutely beautiful and Kimpton has done a great job of retaining the building's classic charm while adding their own quirky touch. I didn't have a chance to eat in the hotel restaurant, as there are too many food choices and must-eats in Chicago to being with, but it looked great and seemed to be doing some great business. The upper floors all have the original office building doors with frosted glass and mail slots.  I believe they are on the 8th floor and higher. I was on the 10th floor and we had a great view north to the Chicago Theater and the river. The views to the northeast would be great as well. Our room was small, which is expected in a building this old, but very well decorated and comfortable. The beds and linens were great and having access to a pillow library, made the stay that much more comfortable. I honestly can't imagine staying anywhere other than the Burnham on my future visits to Chicago. Great place!",5
900,"This hotel was everything I wanted and more. The girlfriend tasked me with planning a date where we got all dressed up all fancy and such. Yelp led me here and as always it did not disappoint. Check-in and check-out were relatively quick and hassle free. One thing I really liked about this place is the fact that they have done everything to retain the old world looks (we got actual keys for our room!) The doors were either original or very reproductions, I loved the hinges on them. The accents throughout the building and our room reflect the exterior of the building and its charm. While marble stairs worn from years of use, just awesome. I also loved the phone they had in the hallway styled to look old world. If you have a chance you might want to visit the Atwood Cafe, after a night out we decided to stop by and get some drinks. They dont skimp on the alcohol and we struck up a good conversation with the bartender (he previously worked at the place we went for dinner that night). Funny story, on our way back up in the elevator from the Atwood Cafe we ended up sharing the elevator with a member of the hotels management, he asked me to hit floor 11... I asked him for one of the bottles of Chianti he had hands full of. He was quick to inform me.... ""ask and ye shall receive"", that simple gesture made our night even better. We had a good laugh over it and enjoyed the bottle later. Great way to end a good night on the town. Great place to stay, the management is helpful and the amenities are generous. OH! And I forgot to add, we stayed in room 1503, its as high as you can go and has great views of State and Washington, see for yourself from my pictures.",5
901,"We are Kimpton In Touch members and have stayed in a number of their hotels on both coasts. Hotel Burnham in particular is so well located when it comes to attending Chicago's Jazz Festival. Just two short blocks west of Millennium and Grant Parks. We were fortunate to have a corner room with views of State and Washington Streets. Views of the parks of course, Macy's (world's second largest department store), and the Chicago Theater. Everything is at your foot steps... The Jewelery District, Water Taxi, Magnificent Mile, parks, and museums. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the visit besides the great jazz was the Chicago skyline of monuments. Our room was extremely comfortable with properly scaled furniture. Velour head board with overhead sheer canopy, matching curtains scripted with Mozart tunes covering the bay windows that were screened with sheer french drop curtains for daytime privacy. Coffee & tea was available each and every morning and on Labor Day, there was an arrangement of donuts, sweets and bagels. That was to make up for the inconvenience of not having the lobby restaurant available. Hotel Burnham is also a designated historical building and once had the pleasure of a visit from Al Capone. Would not ever hesitate to recommend or stay in this hotel again in the future.",5
902,Nice place. More later I'm off to work.,4
903,I LOVE Kimpton properties and staff. The service at all Kimpton properties is unparalleled its what keeps me a loyal to them. Plus Burnham is smack in the middle of two Garretts shops!,5
904,"All in all it was a pretty good stay, the rooms clean and they pride themselves on being green, so that's A-OK. The front desk staff pretty friendly, but they did shove a overnight parking bill under my door with no explanation - I did not drive here!     But the irksome thing was the construction noise, even after changing rooms the noise at night was bothersome, so caveat emptor!",3
905,"Very pleased with our Saturday stay.  I had booked a king suite to celebrate Valentines Day and couldn't have been more pleased with the room or service.  We had a corner room with views East down Washington of the Pritzker Pavillion and North down State Street with views of the old Marshall Fields (I refuse to call it Macy's) and the Chicago theater.  The room had a seating area separate from the bedroom.  Both were very comfortable.  Typical Chicago street noise but certainly tolerable on the 7th floor.  The hotel, the former Reliance Building, is beautiful.  The historical details are everywhere you look.  Everything was spotless.  The only nits were someone had taken the cashews from the mini bar so we made sure to mention this when checking out.  Anyone that knows mini bar protocol is aware that surprise charges can appear later for items you never touched.  The front desk made note of the missing item.  And an errant room service charge had to be removed.  The concierge handled my bouquet and candy request (I know, cliche, but sometimes you gotta stick with tried-and-true basics) and both were waiting in the room when we checked in.  Charges for both were very reasonable.  Be sure to join the Kimpton loyalty program to take advantage of the free wifi and $10 mini bar voucher.  Location is close to Millenium Park and the theatre district.  I know we'll be back.",4
906,"My wife (who is from Chi-Town) escaped visiting her family, surburbs for a night in the Loop - we loved everything! The staff was very friendly, great drinks at 5 pm; we had dinner and breakfast at the Atwood Cafe - both were terrific! Elizabeth was our server for dinner - she was the best! It was our wedding anniversary and the staff gave us an extra bottle of wine with a nice card. We only stay at historic sites - this was special and worth the extra $$. The location cannot be beat. Paying for parking sucked, but hey, this is the Loop. Even Sasha the doorman was a hoot and holler (Go Lakers). I would certainly recommend a night here, our room gave her a slice of the Lake and being opposite the former (sigh) Marshall Fields was so classy!",5
907,"My friend and I had a fabulous stay at this quaint hotel last week.  I received a gift certificate for a weekend stay so we took a road trip down from Milwaukee.  The building is a restored beauty with antique touches and exposed steel bones.  In fact, I learned that it is Chicago's first steel skyscraper.  The location could not have been more centrally located and within walking distance to Millenium park and Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile.  The room we had was lovely and clean and very quiet.  For us the most impressive part of our stay was the friendliness of the staff.  I highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here when I come back to Chicago.",5
908,"My favorite hotel in Chicago.  Why?  First and foremost, the staff is outstanding.  They are so friendly and helpful.  Reggie, the Bell Captain, has been there for years to welcome you to the hotel. Second, is location.  You can take take the blue line to/from O'hare and the hotel is a mere 2 blocks away from the station.  They are also close to 2 ""L"" line stations, and the red line. Third is the complimentary nightly wine reception.  This is a great way to start your evening and I always meet interesting people. Fourth is the decor and history behind this hotel.  Ask to stay on one of the historic floors (7 and above) for a truly unique experience. But again, it is the staff at this hotel which make it exceptional!",5
909,"Another Kimpton gem! Wonderful hotel in historic landmark building  with nicely appointed rooms and all the usual Kimpton amenities, like l'occitaine in your room and great bedding. I requested extra down pillows when I made my reservation and they did remember to include them, which impressed me. Very reasonable rates as well. I only have 2 comments, one of which is beyond their control:  1) no flat screen tv--odd I think. i'm not a tv junkie or anything, but I think a flat screen is more aprapos for a ""stylish"" hotel. 2) construction on state was LOUD... so hopefully that will be finished shortly.",4
910,"I have never stayed at this hotel, nor have I ever set foot in one if its rooms. Nevertheless, I am forever grateful for the Hotel Burnham... June 28, 2008... Leaving Grant Park after the most amazing FREE Stevie Wonder show. The music was still in me as I danced down the street with good friends and a bladder full of magic lemonade. The conversation included talk of hopping on the Brown Line and heading to Lakeview, but I knew I would never make it that far. The lyric in my head quickly had  gone from Stevie's "" All I do is think about you"" to that Detrol commercial's ""Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go right now"". I assured my friends that I would catch up with them later and mumbled something about going to Marshall Fields...I rushed down Washington St. on a mission. But I would have needed a time machine to visit the Marshall Fields bathroom, or even the Macy's bathroom (the store was already closed for the night). Feeling defeated as I stared through the locked Macy's door, I turned around and took a huge sigh of relief. It was the Hotel Burnham & Atwood Cafe. I remembered eating there, and having to cut through the hotel lobby and go downstairs to visit the ladies room. I ran across the street, but slowed down as I entered the hotel lobby and smiled at the front desk staff as I made a bee-line toward the stairs. There, at the bottom of the stairs was the bathroom, just as I had remembered. Afterwards, I walked out of the Hotel Burnham with head held high, and the ability to handle the train ride without the threat of a most embarrassing moment. Thank you Hotel Burnham for being there when I needed you most.",5
911,"Another one of my indulgences is brunch.  A mimosa or bellini, a divinely prepared omelette or eggs benedict...yum.   Yet, I've struggeld to find this sort of experience...until now.  This is my third visit to the Atwood Cafe for brunch and I am now convinced. This is a marvelous, little gem!  The food is wonderful, the service superb and the mimosas are appropriately tasty.  Even more importantly, unlike some of the other brunch/breakfast places, you can make a reservation, the prices are incredibly cheap and space is wonderfully decorated.  Add the cute valet (that resembles Will Smith), the waiter with the catty...yet adorable accent, and you have the perfect Sunday afternoon.",5
912,"Stayed 2 nights recently while I was in  Chicago for my job.  Located at the corner of West Washington and State, it's the perfect location for shopping, theater and sightseeing. You can reach the Burnham easily from O'Hare via subway -- stop is just around the corner. The Art Institute and the Chicago Symphony are both within walking distance.  The rooms are small, yes, but are beautifully decorated, though perhaps not to everyone's taste.  Enjoyed the free evening wine reception and the hotel bar/restaurant seemed quite popular.  Staff are extremely friendly and helpful and create an all around warm atmosphere.  I like to exercise but their tiny fitness room did not meet my needs.  No worries-- there's a Bally's on the next block up on W Washington that allows non-members to work out for $10 a day.  Perfect!",4
913,The Hotel Burnham is a small boutique property in the landmark Reliance Building. The large Chicago School windows of this early skyscraper are magnificently draped in the smallish but comfortable rooms. Notice the ornate details at the elevators and lobby. The Atwood Cafe is quite popular.,4
914,"As a Kimpton hotel, the service is outstanding. The history of the building and its architecture makes it even better. Location is great because its next to a Walgreens (convenient) and barely 2 blocks from the State street train stop (even more convenient).  Ask for a room facing north up State street and you get a great view of the city.  The Aveda products in the room are a nice touch.  Regular rates can be pricey, but join the Kimpton loyalty program or become a fan on Facebook and keep your eyes open for deals.",4
915,Great hotel in a great buiding - award winning renovation.  Great views from the big windows and nice room decor.  The toiletries are top notch too!,5
916,"I have stayed in this hotel ever since I became jealous of another publishing type who had put authors up at the Burnham while me and my people were at the Embassy Suites. So I began my exploration of Chicago hotels. Love and hate. Hate the W Lakeshore for their pretentious, sometimes just mean staff. Love the Holiday Inn Silversmith for really nice and affordable rooms and the unexpected diner and weird, tucked under the L feel. Love what they did to 71 now as much as I hated prior to renovation (and that view from the penthouse rooms -- yea!). LOVE the Sax because you can get food from Bin 36 -- for reals, that is worth the stay (have breakfast there!!!). Love the Monaco even though is like every other Monaco  -- but the service is so perfect and what a location. Hate that giant Hyatt, love the Palmer house, love that place that USED TO BE the Nikko but is stil so nice. Well, anyhow, I could go on and on and on. I love the Burnham because the staff is wonderful at all times. I leave to go to the drugstore and they wish me well, I return ten minutes later and they ask how things are going. I love the tiny space you cram into for the happy hour wine. I love the nest of pillows I make in my bed. I loved the view of the Chicago theater out my wndow. I love the way the Atwood looks (even if food is spotty when too crowded).  I love my clunky hotel key clanking in my pocket. I love the frosted glass on my door. I love the metalwork on the stairs. Traveling a lot to Chicago and not staying at least once at this 150 year ld place is a mistake.",4
917,"This was one of the best hotel experiences of my life. A green hotel, everyone is extremely friendly, it has personality, a great location, great beds and decor, and they constantly have Jazz on! Our room on the 6th floor had a lovely view of the Chicago Theater sign. We didn't even really care that there was a construction site across the street. Once that place is done, this will be an even better location! By the way, a great thing to do while you are staying here and you don't have a bathtub at home.... Go across the street to Lush (In Macy's) and get a bath melt and a bath bomb. Amazing. Will stay here again, absolutely!!",5
918,"Famous for being Chicago's first steel-frame skyscraper, this place is ideal for a weekend getaway if you're planning on catching Wicked at the Oriental Theatre, or the Chicago Theatre and even the Cadillac Palace Theatre is within walking distance.  You've got the Atwood Cafe right there and great shopping on State Street, too.  The Hotel Burnham also offers something called 'pillow menu' where you can select different types of pillows.  Try the herb infused pillow.",4
919,"This place was great! I was drawn to it because of the historic building, and I loved all the design touches. The rooms are lovely and the hallways still look like old office buildings. Our window had a great view. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and unpretentious. The location was very convenient, we were able to walk around the Loop and we very close to parks. The bed was comfortable and the room was nice and quiet. I recommend it and plan to stay there again.",5
920,"The Burnham has the best doormen in the city!  They are so friendly and hail cabs for anyone!  The Atwood Cafe is very busy, especially for lunch - you WILL need a reservation.  The food is actually not all that fantastic, just decent.  The location (right across the street from Marshall Fields) is a popular one.",4
921,"Discovered this hotel with an online advertisement, we picked to stay at Hotel Burnham because of its convenient location and historic interest. We always liked more boutique-style establishments than their big-name counterparts. Moreover, Kimpton chain's super nice pet policy was an A-plus when we traveled with our dog. Service from front desk to housekeeping was across-the-board attentive, courteous and friendly. The architecture was unique and interior was bohemian. Only did I wish they had a glass of absinthe waiting for me at the bar but they did serve you glasses of red or white wine at the turndown hours. Although the size of the room was relatively smaller, the high ceiling compensated the area and made it feel not as claustrophobic. We loved having a descent restaurant in our hotel and the hotel's Atwood Cafe was fantastic. Food was up to par with some good restaurants. At least we kept going back for several more meals. We had no regrets staying at Burnham and for sure we would look for other Kimpton hotels in other cities too.",4
922,"Stayed here a few nights in the Spring of 2007, very enjoyable.  Beautiful lobby, friendly staff, unusual 1920's-office-building decor (nicely renovated).  Only complaint: noise from construction across the street, but that's certainly not their fault.",4
923,"Very old, very cool.",5
924,"Fabulous architectural details, boutique elegance, exceptional location and grand views. Excellent Kimpton staff. Highly recommended!",4
925,"I stayed at the Hotel Burnham for three nights right after Christmas.  The location is great for the Art Museum, Theatre District, restaurants and shopping.  I was excited to experience a Kimpton hotel because the reviews I had read about their boutique  hotels led me to believe that the Burnham would have a friendly and a cozier feel to it.  I was disappointed.  The room was lovely, but the bathroom was small and my showerhead had pressure problems.  The water was also lukewarm so I could not take a hot, relaxing shower.  The ""free"" hot chocolate that was offered in the lobby was somehow never available when I was in the lobby.  I ordered room service for breakfast all three mornings there.  Two of the three days, food or some item was not brought up on the first delivery forcing me to call room service and have the server bring up the missing food or item.  Not good when you have already poured milk on your cereal and realize the sugar packets are missing.  The down comforter was not in a duvet cover leaving me to wonder if I was sharing the uncovered comforter with the previous guest (s).  The person at the front desk assured me that the comforters are cleaned for each new guest(s), however, I did not feel confident in what he told me.  On the bright side, I loved the location of the hotel, and I loved the view from my room.  I was on the corner of State and Washington Streets, and I could see the Bean at Millenium Park.   I cannot say that my stay at the Hotel Burnham was unpleasant because I loved the sheer excitement of being in downtown Chicago, and some of the staff were very kind and helpful; notably Ben at the front desk, and one of the housekeepers whose name escapes me.  But on the whole, I would not stay at this hotel again, and possibly not at any of the Kimpton Hotels after this experience.",2
926,"This was my first trip to Chicago so I really loved this hotels downtown location. It was walking distance to all the famous shopping, the river, river taxi stops, the beach and Navy pier.   I also loved the comfy beds and quiet room. I thought it was rather expensive for the size of room you get but am told that Chicago is almost as pricey as NYC, so $150 a night wasn't a bad deal. The valet parking is $36 - which you have to get if you rolled into town in a car. However;  that I am told, isn't that expensive either. They don't serve a complimentary breakfast which is a bummer, but our room did have a bath-tub. One minus, one plus. All-n-all, we had a lovely stay.",3
927,"Oh Red Roof... thank you for providing a somewhat cheaper place for me to stay... But other than price, NOTHING about my experience was pleasing. Lured in by the cheaper than normal room rate, the pictures that I saw of the room actually weren't too bad! I reserved the room and noted that *some rooms had refrigerators and microwaves. Upon arrive, NOT the room pictured nor were there any appliances as were listed. Not only that, but the room LOOKED dirty. Even after it had been cleaned. The door to the bathroom wouldn't latch (crooked door frame), and the windows were bolted shut with the air conditioning non-functioning. Add to it the wifi here was slower than dial up, and I was one unhappy person. Lucky for me I didn't spend a ton of time IN the actual room, but seriously... Spend the extra $30 and get a room across the street at the Marriott.",2
928,"Absolutely acceptable for the type of property.  Wish the windows were more soundproof, but the room was clean, the halls smelled of fresh paint smell, and the hotel has been cleaning rugs and drapes in each room (warnings are posted).  near all kinds of good stuff.  free wifi that mostly seems to work.  ac works well (which is good because it's hot-n-sweaty season here in chicago).",3
929,"Came to Chicago on a trip with 2 of my friends and stayed here for 2 nights. We paid for a deluxe double room with A MAGNIFICENT MILE VIEW, paying extra for the view. I wish we could attach pictures to reviews, so I could post a picture of our ""view"" because all we could see was the unattractive building next to us, and the ugly roof and heating ducts of a shorter building below us. Our TV was broken, which wasn't the worst thing in the world because most of our trip was spent sightseeing, but it was kind of a bummer when we got back at night and wanted to put it on. The maid ASKED us if we wanted our room cleaned (YES!). The WiFi was free, but was so painfully slow I half expected to hear the hissing of a dial up connection. However, the location is fantastic, very close to the Navy Pier, walking distance to Millenium Park, nice area of the city, good restaurants nearby. The price was very reasonable (despite paying for a view we didn't have). The front desk staff was extremely nice and helpful, especially a woman named Nikita I believe. Overall, not an atrocious experience, but definitely nothing special.",3
930,"Ugh. Where do I start? I came for a conference and this place was significantly cheaper, so I took a chance and stayed here.... bad, BAD idea. The thermostat was broken, and it never got about 62F in the room - FREEZING! Can you imagine what it would be like if it were snowing?!?! WTF? You'd freeze your b@lls off! The rooms were moderately clean, but again, nothing impressive. I've you're looking for a good deal, go to the Inn of Chicago which is a block away. It's nicer with more competitive rates..... plus you won't freeze.",1
931,"Unfortunately, perhaps the worst experience I've had at a hotel in the US (not the world). First, a few good things: -Location is superb -Can't beat the price -Desk staff was helpful and nice And now the litany of bad things: -Room smelled horrible (like sewage of sewer gases) -Made a NYC hotel room look huge. -Was not clean or cleaned very well. -Had a couple of roaches -AC didn't work in my room -Toilet wouldn't reliably flush -Shower water pressure was what I would describe as a dribble. -Room didn't have a Iron or ironing board in it (weird, but I did get one on request) -Room layout was not well done (i.e. no desk, just a bed, never seen this before) -No amenities of any kind besides really slow wifi, not even coffee and donuts in the AM. Bottom-line, you get what you pay for and this place is cheap. As others have said if you're not going to be in room and just out and about it's probably passable, but just. Incidentally, after two nights in a simply awful room I explained my plight to the manager and she promptly moved me without any fuss to a new room which was much better.",2
932,"Disgusting. Came with my friend just for a place to stay....horrible. They were doing renovations in the lobby made it look rundown. The hostess at the desk logged like she may not even have worked there because she had no Id badge. They head A big creepy guy for their valet service. E elevators are incredibly small and old. My bathroom towels had a curly black hair in it. Two,of my three pillows had long black hairs on them which almost made me throw up. The rooms suck. Very small. Weird smell. Rooms are freezing. Would never ever ever go back.",1
933,"Pros - So super cheap. Amazing location. Friendly staff. Comfortable pillows. Cons - It smells. Legit, like a strong bleach smell that makes you think people have died recently in the room. It is also dingy and claustrophobic. If you are spending no time in your room, it's perfect. If you like downtime in your hotel room, you might want to keep looking.",2
934,"This was place was alright.  I recently booked a room last minute. The rooms were somewhat small but had a safe, extra storage, and the hotel is dog friendly which is a rarity for a downtown ""cheap"" room. I would have given more stars if it was cleaner. The bathroom floors, walls and door were pretty ragged. Valet was $40, which I was sort of bummed about when we ended up waiting 20 mins to get our car even though we called ahead and explained we were in a hurry. $40 is standard for the location. Also there is no street parking at all. Other than that, the staff was really friendly, and the location is pretty cool. I highly reccomend this place if you are traveling with a dog and need a last minute place to chill in the city.",3
935,"Reasonable priced Small room Extremely friendly staff Great if you just need a crash pad They need to check their supply however, everything was out. Extra blanket, decaf and bottled water from the vending machine",4
936,"Is it cheap? Yes. Is it well located? Yes. Are the rooms amazing? Hell No. This is a very budget ""motel"" nicer than I was expecting, but still miles away from something I'd recommend to my picky friends.  I stay here for a number of reasons, the price is awesome.. around 56 bucks a night for a room in downtown Chicago is awesome.  The rooms are smaller, but enough for me... I don't come to Chicago to sit in my hotel room, I sleep here and that's about it. I've never had a problem with check in, the staff has also been very nice, no major issues with the room.  They are quick to address anything that is wrong, for instance during my last trip the iron had some residue from previous use.. I called and it was fixed within 30 minutes.",4
937,"Disgusting. Ants in the room everywhere, shower drain stopped up, dirty floors, stickiness on the floor, unattentive staff, and the worst experience I have had in a long time. Booked this for 4 days and checked out in one and refused to pay.",1
938,"Went in June 2011.  Was a place to stay.  As another reviewer said, VERY friendly staff, rooms are sleepable, and the biggest plus, PET FRIENDLY!!  They even give your room a discount if you have a pet. No free breakfast; free coffee though. Also has WIFI, but a weaker signal the further back you are",3
939,"I mean its a Red  Roof Inn- your expectations has got to be really really low already but if you stay here- make sure they are even lower than usual.  I'm glad that I was able to stay here for Labor Day weekend for 6 days and only paid a few hundred bucks. My girlfriends and I only there at night to sleep but below are the pros and cons. Pros: - Nice lobby- that needs to transcend to the bedroom- looks like they might be getting there - Free wifi - Cheap - Right across the street from Garret's popcorn - 1 block away from Michigan Avenue and major public transportation - Walking distance to a Dunkin Donuts, 7-11, Corner Bakery, etc. - Able to leave items locked up before checking and after when you have checked out already - A safe, hair dryer, ironing board - Friendly staff Cons: - Excruciatingly small rooms with run down decor and bed spread. Gross - Our 16th floor room had no view whatsoever other than other tall buildings - Super small bathroom- I had to put on makeup with the bigger mirror on the floor lobby - Only 2 elevators and one broke at one point so only one can be used - No full length mirror anywhere :/ - No bathroom in the lobby area Next time I go to Chicago I think it may be worth it to spend a little bit more money to stay at a better place. I'd stay here for something cheaper or free though since the location is spot on. Its right across the street from a Marriot and I'm sure people that stayed there the same amount of time payed 3x as much as we did.",3
940,"This is without a doubt the filthiest, most disgusting hotels in the world. Don;t walk run from this place.",1
941,"WELL.. where do I start. How about the good.. * Great location - right by Michigan avenue and all the shops * Across the street from Garrett's Popcorn! * Easy to find and get to... walking distance to so many places * Right next to the bus stop * Pretty friendly staff at the front desk * super cheap the bad: *dirty - rooms have not been kept up *small rooms - there was NO walking space *no desk *beds were very small and very low *bathroom is smaller than any other bathroom I have been too.. there is pretty much no room on the sink counter *lobby does not have a bathroom? isn't that weird? *room was not cleaned regularly *found a bug on the floor - do not walk around barefoot here *towels and amenities left something to be desired - the towels were so small they barely cover your body! *elevators are small, cramped, and chose to work when they wanted to In a nutshell... stay here if you do not plan to stay for long or are looking for a bargain room next to everything. Do not expect much.",1
942,"This review is written in consideration of location, price and hotel. Location:  You are less than a block from Michigan Avenue's Magnificent  Mile.  This is the heart of Chicago. A short walk to the L-train station. You are surrounded by numerous restaurants and 4-5 star hotels.  There's even a 24-hour 7-11 down the street. Price:  We stayed here from December 27 to January 3, that's 7 nights. We had the largest hotel room, the suite...with a desk area, small living room (sofa bed), hall bathroom, fridge, microwave, two flat-screen TV's, king bed, and full bath.  All this for:  $632.84 (total price, with tax). Hotel:  This isn't a 5-star hotel stay. Let me explain.  The bathroom doesn't have heat or an air vent. The water pressure in the shower was non-existent. Stains and rips on the furniture. And, expect some street noise. Having said all of this...it wasn't a problem. It wasn't a big deal. One last thing to mention, the staff was extremely friendly. You get what you pay for.  But in this case, we got more than we expected. We would stay here again and recommend it to our friends and family.",5
943,"I'm giving Red Roof Inn 4 stars if only for the fact that I was one block away from Michigan Avenue and only had to pay $120 a night. That being said, the rooms are the sizes of small dorm rooms and how they fit 2 full sized beds and a dresser in there is beyond my mental ability. No joke, there was about a foot and a half between the foot of the bed and the wall. The bathroom wasn't much better, though it was clean and that was my only concern. I have to say that while this Red Roof Inn was run down, it wasn't dirty or grimy. The staff was non-existent. That's good if nothing goes wrong, but if you had any needs I don't know if that would be a plus. $33 a night for parking is a crime where I come from, but like I said, you're getting a steal with the price of the room.",4
944,"I usually travel on a budget, but this Red Roof really drops the ball. Strike one: The rooms are not clean!! That's the most important quality about a hotel. Wouldn't you rather sleep on a slab on concrete in an immaculately clean room than a soft mattress in a room full of dust and dirt? There were large piles of dust in the corners in the bathroom, and the corners of the sink had caked on dirt. The grout on the floor was cracked and stained different colors. Most Motel 6s that I've been in are better maintained/cleaner than this room. Strike two: One of the elevators was broken. According to previous reviews, this is something that happens pretty frequently. For a hotel with 16 floors, you would think that they would have people on call for repairs like this, especially for a spring weekend when there are lots of guests. The rooms are a tight fit, but most rooms in metropolitan areas are going to be small.  The mattress was nearing the end of its life, and yes, the bedspreads are icky.  Our toilet tank was a little leaky, so the toilet would spontaneously flush itself when no one was in the bathroom. This place would have gotten one star if it hadn't been for the EXCELLENT customer service from the front desk. The people working there were patient and polite, even with a constant stream of guests arriving at the desk. We had booked the room through a third-party site, and the woman at the desk made sure that we had two non-smoking rooms next to each other and let us check-in early. They sent up extra pillows to the room when we asked. I was really happy with the service we received. The valet parking guys were really nice, too. Parking was $36 with in/out privileges, which was a better deal than parking in the garage across the street.  TIP:  If you park at that parking garage, the Courtyard Mariott gives out blue parking tickets to give you a discount on the daily rate.  It may be a little dishonest since you are not staying at that hotel, but if you're checking out a review for a Red Roof, then I have a feeling you don't have extra cash burning a hole in your pocket. Even though this is a great location at a good price, I would try to use Priceline or Hotwire to get a better room at a nicer hotel for the same price.",2
945,"Well, bed bugs like it here, what more do I need to say?  The shower hadn't been cleaned properly in the room, room was dirty upon close inspection.  Reservation made for conference, couldn't get out with other hotels booked.  Got bit like crazy, bed bugs all up in here!  Checked them out on the internet and it turns out that they have had lawsuits at this hotel for bed bug attacks!  Just put it into google and see for yourself.  I'd avoid this place.",1
946,"Great location, cheap as is comes. Small rooms. Missing remote from tv but not in the room long enough to care. No conditioner supplied in shower. Water is luke warm. Show drained REALLY slow. Walls are paper thin. For chicago on a budget this is ok but I have stayed better.",2
947,"Remember the cousin you had that was always loud, obnoxious, dirty, and drunk? The one that ruined every family gathering for all? You wouldn't wish this place on him.... that's how bad it is. There is a reason why it's half the price of other hotels in the area. As others have said, the staff IS very good. But they can't make up for the lack of eveything else. It's cold, dirty, run-down, and very, very noisy.",1
948,A lot of older relatives and the like stay here when they come to town.  It's a great location and amazing price considering.  They've all been very happy with it and keep going back.,4
949,"The price is inexpensive, the internet is weak.  The thermostat is not easy to operate.  If you have an allergy, the air inside will trigger your symptoms.  The room is very small.  Its a motel 6 quality.",3
950,"This Red Roof Inn was formerly the Richmont and later a Motel 6. This is one of the few Red Roofs in a downtown location. It is a decent enough place, but the location just a block east of Michigan Avenue is the best thing about this place.",3
951,"No complaints here and a great location.  Located one block from Michigan Ave. and near the Grant 'L' it felt like we were right in the middle of things.  Service was friendly and room, while not luxurious, was quite comfortable.  For $129.99, I'd definitely stay again.",4
952,We stayed here for $50 a night while in Chicago checking out apartments. It was mostly clean  except for a few hairs around the shower and sink. The wifi is T-mobile and is extremely slow. They have Lodgnet with a physical lock on the connection so you can't plug in a laptop and watch your movies from your macbook. Room was small yet cozy. Staff was friendly. Location wasn't as convenient as the Travelodge I stayed at a few years ago but still a good choice for downtown Chicago.,4
953,"This hotel was great. The location was awesome. It was the best deal I could find for downtown (everything else was 200-400 dollars a night and the Red Roof is 119.) I expected it to be more basic than it was. The bed was comfy, the room was clean, the service was decent. The decor was modern. We requested a room that faced Ontario street like our guidebook suggested, and we got a corner room facing ontario street (windows on two walls) which was great. It even came with a fridge and a microwave. The only two things that would have made it perfect would have been coffee makers in the rooms (there is a horrible complimentary coffee machine in the lobby, which was broken half the time) and a business center where we could check our email or bank accounts online. Although the coffee situation sucked, there is a Starbucks across the street which was pretty convenient. I would definately recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago who is on a budget.",4
954,"I went here couple months ago and their rooms were very affordable and cozy! The service was not the best ,but overall the price and the service was good enough for me.",3
955,"We used this as the cheap hotel option for our guests for our wedding. I think we had a rate of $89 a night the weekend we had it, which was great for those that didnt want to spend too much. No complaints on the rooms from anyone that I heard of. It is a little bit of an older hotel and not too many amenities, but they have updated some things and for the price it was great. One guest got turned away because he arrived late, which is something that should not happen for a group. I never followed up on it, so I'm not sure what happened exactly but thats what I heard. Either way they should have made some arrangment to get them situated. We also had some problems with guests getting rooms in our block, people saying that the block was full when it really wasn't. So it was extra work involved on our part to get that figured out, which having extra stress when planning a wedding isn't so much fun.",3
956,"Ah, the Amalfi Hotel. I love this place. It is bang smack in the center of Chicago, a stone's throw away from tons of great restaurants and the Magnificent Mile shopping area. We got married in Chicago in May and we worked with Dan Wheeler and Moji Akinde as we had about 50 rooms for our friends and family booked here. Dan and Moji were great to work with ... very flexible with our numerous requests and always willing to make this experience easier as, with any wedding, it is one of the 100 things that we had to sort out but this was one where I was happy to leave it to the experts. Thanks Dan and Moji. The hotel itself is great. It is a boutique hotel which was what we wanted rather then the blah-ness of the larger chains. The foyer is amazing (and great for wedding photos). The rooms were large and very modern. The gym has lots of equipment and was seldom busy. To top it off there is also a breakfast buffet on every floor which was great for the morning after the night before when my heart (and head) was not into going out for breakfast. There is also a happy hour which complimentary cocktail and appetizers ... my friends and family did not miss a night here and it helped to make the hotel even more affordable. In summary the hotel is great ... central location, very reasonable rates, friendly staff, clean and modern rooms, complimentary breakfast and happy hour, free WiFi. Highly recommended.",5
957,"young, modern, centrally located - those three words describe amalfi the best. The staff is quite young and ambitious, spending a comfortable atmosphere. The hotel has bewn built in 2004 and stays modern. The rooms are spacious, the beds, gosh, i wish i never have to leave it - extremly comfortable! And it is very well located. You are in everything's walking distance, north as much as south. Around the corner you fis a couple of nice steak houses, pubs n bars. The breakfast you got on the corridor with more than just the standard continental one. Further, you got free drinks in the late afternoon! I do recommend to stay here (will be #1 choice when i come back to chicago...)",4
958,"The three major deciding factors in choosing this hotel over others in the area were 1) free wifi 2) free continental breakfast and 3) proximity to all the popular Chicago sights. Wifi was spotty in some areas of my second floor room but I can't complain because other hotels in the same price range were charging $10-15/day. While many hotels that boast continental breakfast end up having meager offerings, Amalfi's breads, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and drinks were abundant and helped us jump start our days of sight seeing. This also helped us save a money instead of going out every day to buy breakfast. My boyfriend and I do not have any finicky requests when staying at hotels. All we need is a comfy bed to sleep in at night to recharge for the next days activities. If you're a tourist this will be the perfect hotel for you. All of the major sights are within walking distance. Magnificent Mile (5-10 min), Sears Tower (20 min), John Hancock (15-20 min), Millennium Park (15-20 min) - all VERY walkable (which you should do to walk off all that yummy Chicago food!). Also, Trader Joe's is a mere 5 minute walk away if you need to stock up on 17 cent water bottles to keep yourself hydrated as you explore Chicago. Walk south for about 5 minutes and you'll be at the Blue line which gets you to and from O'Hare in 45 minutes. The Red line is also very close by. Although we did not ask for much, the staff was very nice and helpful. We had an issue with one of our keys not working and they were apologetic and immediately helped resolve the problem. Very satisfied with my stay here!",4
959,"This place is a wonderful value in the middle of a city that rivals New York in cost. Amalfi is a small boutique hotel that was probably previously owned by a larger chain. I say that because there are a few features that scream ""generic chain"" namely the bathtub. Beautiful granite countertops greet you only to turn around and see a blah tub with a shower curtain that looks much like my Aunt Ethel's (well if I had an aunt Ethel I think it would look like that). Point being...it is a boutique hotel without 100% execution. Don't let that deter you though...there are plenty of positives. They offer an evening reception with an Italian spread. Fabulous cheeses, meats and olives line the buffet. There is an open bar with a wonderful selection. Try the Amalfitini. Even my non-girly drink consuming husband liked it. They also have a continental breakfast on each floor. I loved the fact that I didn't have to travel far to get my donuts and yogurt. The employees were hit or miss. The bell staff was incredibly friendly and helpful!!! Most of the front desk staff was very kind and outgoing. There were two women that were a bit on the snotty side but we didn't let that detract from our stay. The amenities were fabulous! Aveda bath products and they even offer body wash and not the standard bar soap cheaper hotels have gone too. I really liked that. Internet is fast and free! Parking is valet only but we were able to find self parking down the street a bit. Their valet rates however, were the cheapest I had found. Overall, this hotel was a wonderful Italian gem in the middle of the windy city. We will definitely be back! Oh,,,and if you are bringing your pooch they will welcome him (or her) with open arms!",4
960,"Nice hotel in a good location, very close to everything.   I liked that they provided free wi-fi and breakfast on every floor, there was a good variety of food and it was nice to not have to go far.  Staff was friendly although the lobby setup was weird, I liked that they provided free copies of Time Out Chicago, which was useful. The room was very large and spacious but Amalfi loses a star because the view out our window was just a brick wall.  Hey, at least we had privacy.",4
961,"I like this hotel. The staff very friendly, you will feel like in home. Great location, great hotel to spend the night :)",4
962,"Nice independent, boutique hotel. ROOM - spacious and clean - bed and bedding were comfortable - large rolling desk - large bathroom with lots of counter space -iPod alarm clock dock available STAFF - very friendly - fast and easy check-in and check-out - housekeeping did a great job each day - concierge/bell hop will hold your luggage the day you check-out AMENITIES - fast and free wifi (password given to you during check-in) - free breakfast daily on EACH floor! (juices, coffee, teas, bagels, pastries, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, etc) - free manager's reception daily which includes open bar and snacks - computer and printer available to check-in and print boarding passes - room amenities include AVEDA brand toiletries, hair dryer, sewing kit, shower cap, shoe mitt, vanity chair, small zoom vanity mirror, iron, ironing board, slippers, and robes - mini fridge in room OTHER - walkable to State/Lake and Clark/Lake 'L' station - walkable to many popular destinations - many bars and restaurants in the area Overall, convenient location with great amenities at an affordable price! Would definitely recommend to someone.",4
963,"Very nice boutique hotel in a great location. The room was very comfortable with a great bathroom. Good shower water pressure and lots of counter space. Plus a magnifying mirror and even a little stool that was a nice touch. Much more space than I expected for an urban boutique. Bed was comfortable and the linens were good quality. I like that they desk was a little lower so you could actually put your computer on it comfortably, and it rolled around so it was nice to position it where you wanted it. I could have used a few more outlets near the bed so I could plug my phone in, but overall, the room was very well put together. The checkin was efficient and the staff very helpful. The doormen were really friendly and didn't make me feel like their hand was constantly out for a tip. They do a breakfast buffet on every floor and it was MUCH better than I expected. It was great to just walk out and grab something. They have a cocktail hour that I never made it to - but will next time. I ordered room service from Harry Carreys across the street. This is a great idea since they don't mark up the food, and it's great. They do add an 18% gratuity and a $2.50 service charge, but that's totally reasonable. And it was very fast. I think more hotels should do this, everyone does what they are good at!",4
964,"The wife and I stayed here with another couple while we were visiting Chicago from Toronto. My friend booked this hotel from Toronto since he got a good deal per night from his work. We got there and during check in, we were told that the two rooms were not together but on different floors. My thing is, he booked this hotel a month or so in advance and asked that both rooms be together or at least on the same floor. You can call and put in REQUESTS. When he had requested it, the person on the phone checked and agreed. Yet, when we check in, we are told something different. As always, every hotel is completely booked whenever you need something regarding a room. What's new? So from the first moment, I wasn't happy. We get to the room and it's an okay size and clean. No complaints with that. The continental breakfast is a plus since it's on your floor so you can go in your pj's or whatever. All in all, I remember that this place wasn't pleasant. It's in a good location downtown close to everything you need. I remember the staff wasn't friendly or helpful. The lobby is quite small as well but then again, it's downtown so I guess the space was limited. An okay place to stay at.",3
965,"As far as I am concerned, I do not need to ever stay in any other hotel in the Chicago area.  Chicago is a great place to visit and, at least in the summer...those cold winds blowing off the lake in winter are not fun.  But summer is great and there is always something to do.  On a recent trip we stayed for the first time at the Amalfi Hotel...and this is now my favorite hotel ever.  It is very small and the staff is just fantastic.  They were ready to help at any time.  I almost wish we had a problem while we were there so that I could have seen how they handled it...but I never got the chance since the approximately one week stay there was just perfect.  The hotel has the perfect location on the near north side and everything of interest is either a walk or a short taxi ride away.  In the evening you can enjoy free cocktails and munchies up on the 5th floor...you have got to try their Amalfitini...I just had to go back every night for more, it was so good.  I guarantee that you will love this place...and, by the way, get there in the late afternoon and try the cookies at the registration desk...but no fair eating the whole platter full!",5
966,"The Amalfi Hotel is a fantastic choice when staying in Chicago.  There are a lot of options in this city, high end to more economical but what makes the Amalfi Hotel stand out are the people, convenience and little ""extras"" that make a hotel stay an experience.   1.  The people are beyond amazing.  So nice, helpful and always happy to see you. 2.  The rooms are well maintained, comfy, spacious 3.  LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION.  This hotel is in the center of it all. Located within a few blocks of the subway, this made the hotel easy to find and easy to leave when needing to get to the airport. In the theater district with the House of Blues right around the corner and the good old land mark of the Chicago Marquee Theater.  Restaurants abound, with Keefer attached to the hotel and Public House as you walk out the door.  Round the corner and you have a true taste of Chicago with some of the best best pizza, (Rossi's pizza by the slice) Mother Hubbard's local bar and etc. 4. There is a complimentary breakfast served each morning on each floor.   5. Happy Hour, open bar (definitely try the Amalfitini) and snacks (great selection of cheese, olives, finger foods, bread, cold cuts etc) ...this place is so wonderful, why the 4 stars?   While during our stay, we noticed there is a bar/club right next to the hotel that played music until 4:30a.m and we could hear the loud people and music ONLY on Saturday night.  All other nights it was quiet. Also, we stayed on the 4th floor and had a splendid view of a brick wall. :(",4
967,"The Amalfi Hotel is a great choice when staying in Chicago.  Located just north of the River, you get around pretty easily either by foot, ""L"" train or car.  We were greeted by a very friendly staff and check-in/check-out were effortless.   The room was very nice.  There was a much in the way of space and amenities as a person could want.  The TV was fine.  The remote has a tiny delay but, that doesn't set me back.  There was plenty of space.  The bathroom was fine.  The double faucet in the shower was a personal dream come true.  We even had a pretty good view of the city from our room. Every morning, there was a generous continental breakfast that was maintained pretty diligently by the staff (who were also really nice).  Each evening there was a cocktail party in the Ravello Lounge on the top floor which is always pretty popular.  The house cocktails (the Amalfitini and the Sorrento Sunset) and pretty darn tasty!  I won't lie, it's a pretty sweet set up they've got here.   I plan on returning to the Amalfi.  I also recommend it pretty freely.  We were treated well and left making plans for our next visit.",4
968,"Full disclosure: I did not actually stay here.  But my friends did!  And I was with them during check-in and saw their room and all that, so I deem that I'm qualified to review the Amalfi. I actually work next door, so I can tell you that the doormen are super friendly - they always have a nice smile for you or a quick hello as you walk by, guest or not.  Every once in a while, they've even helped me get a cab - thanks guys! The desk staff is equally pleasant.  They couldn't have been nicer during check-in!  There were a lot of people waiting around, and while they were efficient about getting you settled, they never made you feel rushed. The room was nicely decorated, very clean, and a good size.  Everything looked fairly new - they seem to do a good job of taking care of things around here. There's also a complimentary happy hour for guests starting at 5:30 and let me tell you - it is wildly popular!  At 5:30 on the dot, there was pretty much a mad rush of people going up to the Ravello Lounge.  It's probably a little less nuts during the week, but I'm betting the place was packed based on how many people were headed up to the 6th floor. Overall, my friends had a good experience here, and I was pleased with everything I saw - I would certainly recommend the Amalfi to Chicago-bound visitors!",4
969,"Spent the weekend here and it was great.  Checked in at 3:00, our room was ready and after checking emails and catching up on a little bit of work, it was 5:30.  Cocktail hour (or in this case...90 minutes)  They have a room set up for free drinks and food every day at 5:30.  Good stuff.  My wife had the ""Amalfitini"" and I had a gin and tonic.  Beefeaters Gin, better than what I had expected.  Met a couple from Switzerland and had a great time talking over a few more drinks. We had a corner room with views of 3 different directions.  Plenty of space and in the morning, there's a continental breakfast set up on each floor.  This is great as you don't have to juggle coffee and a bagel in the elevator. Bellmen were nice and accomodating.  It's in River North and close to so many restaurants and clubs.  I highly recommend it.",5
970,We all know travel can be stressful and where we reside upon our travel is absolutely important.  I travel to Chicago nearly 7 times a year and choose Amalfi Hotel not only for the convenience and great rooms but the staff and overall experience is worth it.  There are endless restaurants and convenient shopping whether you wish to shop State or Michigan Avenue.   Safe Travels to you...,5
971,"This Hotel is a Gem !!! One of the best locations in Chicago ,so central to the best restaurants and clubs and All the sites. The complimentry breakfast every morning was soooooo awesome (breakfast in bed on a cold day is priceless) The rooms are nicely decorated and very well kept .special props toChase (bellboy),he guided us to our favorite spots and helped create our perfect vacation! Thank you!!! I highly recommend this hotel to everyone !!!",5
972,"Our room was cozy. I really couldn't hear anyone in the halls or rooms next to ours. Unfortunately, on the weekend we could hear the bars downstairs quite a bit, but it wasn't too bad. I wish there had been more outlets for all our electronic devices. We loved the morning continental breakfast and the evening happy hour. The workout room was clean with modern equipment. The staff was always very helpful and pleasant.",4
973,"The room view was of a brick wall,but the shower was awesome a double head sprayer,the cocktails and snacks from 5:30 to 7pm was totally reelaxing and a superb way to begin a evening .a few bill disputes stopped a 5 star rating",4
974,"Four thumbs up! First trip to Chicago and the hotel experience at Amalfi blew away any hotel I have ever stayed at. Perfect location, especially for St. Patrick's day, and it was immaculately clean. Their staff at the front desk/concierge were knowledgeable, eager to help and SO pleasant. The room was roomy and spotless. Book the room that includes both breakfast AND the cocktail lounge (complimentary drinks) before walking to either corner of the Kinzie block for a fine dining experience or a casual fun bar! A ++++++++++ Thank you Amalfi for a great weekend!",5
975,"This hotel kind of reminded me of the casino hotels in Biloxi,MS to give you a reference. Some of the staff was nice and some not so much. It was weird no one offered to bring our bags to our rooms but only helped with our bags on our day of departure. I liked the complimentary lemon cookies from Maggiano's Little Italy which greeted us at the welcome desk. Although their breakfast is not as great as the ones served at Holiday Inn it was very sufficient with it's yogurt and bagels with various condiments such as cream cheese and peanut butter. The location could not be beat within walking distance of Michigan ave and Wacker Dr the dock for the Architectural Boat Tour and Xoco Rick Bayless restaurant! Next time I'm in town I definitely wanna check out the complimentary happy hour.",4
976,"This place had some major downfalls, with a few good qualities that I will give them full credit for. Downfalls: NOISY! I booked through a show I go to 6 times a year and it was my first time at the Amalfi.  I got a room on the alley (lovely I know), and there was constant noise ALL NIGHT LONG! Glass breaking, loud party goers, blasted trash trucks at all hours! Maybe invest in better windows Amalfi? My favorite part was on the day I checked out the maids came to all the rooms on my floor knocking at 7:30 and when I said I was still using the room she shouted through the door ""When are you leaving!"", um... not the friendliest service! I also had an issue with my shower and called down and asked them to service it 2 days in a row and don't think anyone ever came to fix it because it still had issues. My company had to send me a box and they charged me a $5 recieving fee?  They never even brought the box to my room, I had to go down two days in a row and ask for it. Good qualities: Nice rooms for the price, Chicago is PRICEY! Within walking distance to my destination the Merchandise Mart.  Continental breakfast on every floor was a nice touch. Never got to the happy hour because I was working but I heard great thigns about it. They have umbrella's in the room you can use or purchase if you decide to keep, this came into great use as it rained most of my trip. If I chose to stay here again I would demand a room on a different side of the building and put out the do not disturb sign on my check out day!!!",3
977,"This is one of two hotels my company uses in Chicago, so I stay here a lot. It's fine, and could be really good, but I just wish it would fix some of it's foibles. Pluses: great fitness room with new and high quality equipment. Free wireless. Comfy beds. Good idea: happy hour, with good quality booze. Bad execution: the room only seats about 20 people, and in 15 days here I think I've been able to find a seat twice. Good idea: breakfast set out on each floor, and the coffee is really good. Bad execution: show up at 7:10 instead of 7:01, and it has been raided, with no idea when more might be coming, unless you want to go to a different floor. So-so: River North location. Close to lots of restaurants, but can sometimes be full of loud bar-goers who make noise at night. Just hope your room isn't within shouting distance of Public House. Not good: I think the night desk guy is snotty and not terribly helpful. Weird: room service comes from Harry Caray's. They do at least have salads and sandwiches on the menu in case you don't want a $35 steak for room service. I'd like to like it here, but I've just seen too much of the place's quirks to be really happy with it.",3
978,"Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party, and was disappointed.  The hotel is beautiful, the staff was all rather friendly.  The main problem was the room/sleeping situation.   We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before, but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out (how that happens I don't know!!) so they ""upgraded"" us to two ""suites"" with a king and a pull out.   First, this meant our party was split up and on different floors.  Second, that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch.  :(  I'm not a picky, unreasonable person, but that was the WORST ""bed"" I've ever slept on!  It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed.  Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night!  Just awful!  For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable!   I would not stay here again after this experience.",2
979,"The amalfi hotel is great.  I've only stayed there on business so I don't usually hang out in the room all day. I do alot of traveling and have to admit, the rooms are small though so try to get a corner room, they're bigger.   The amenities in the rooms are great, love the robe and slippers!  They have THE BEST continental breakfast on every floor each morning. They also have an awesome happy hour every day with FREE top shelf alcohol along with some antipasto.  The staff who works the happy hour is great!   I literally choose to stay in this hotel when i'm in chicago just for the breakfast and happy hour, love it!   Although, Amalfi if you're reading this, what happened to the vendor you used to get the flakey, buttery chocolate croissants from??! The new ones taste like a roll or bread?  Love that you added other new stuff to the breakfast mix, but bring that old croissant back!!!! I see people complain about the food, that they don't have room service, yes I agree that it sucks to have Harry Cary's as the only option. But they make up for it with the free breakfast and happy hour,,,,,so that is totally fair.  Plus there are some really great places in Rivernorth to dine at so there are many options.....I would suggest Rockit or Havana.   THe only thing i can't give rave reviews about is the people at the front desk, never had anyone really give me great service and at times they have even ignored me while on the phone. Everyone else at the hotel makes up for them though, even the door dudes are nice. So I used to come here for years and loved looking at the photos of the amalfi coast and said ""i'd love to go to the real amalfi one day""!  I got to do that this year! Stay here when you can get a good rate and if you like boutique hotels.",4
980,"I stayed here in 2004 and thought it was incredible, and I was very excited to return. I was a little worried that I had overhyped it to myself, and it wouldn't quite live up to the expectations of the younger, more easily impressed me. I was wrong. The Amalfi is one of the best hotel experiences a person can possibly have (outside of the people who drop like 5k a night on rooms). Upon entering, the lobby is nice with music playing, and the checkin is very smooth. The rooms are great. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever been in. the mattress, sheets, pillows, everything. I can go on and on about these beds, they are that comfortable. Nice LCD TVs and they leave a few books and jazz CDs in your room which is really cool! I read they have a library of DVDs and CDs if you want. I didnt check out the minibar but from my last experience i think i really liked it. There's not much of a view, but who cares. Nice robe and slippers in the rooms also. The hotel as a gym which is basically a few treadmills, but it helps. USA today at your door every morning. Each floor has a breakfast station which is really cool. Juices, bagels, pastries, etc. The hotel as a complimentary happy hour also, from 530-7 with free alcohol (tip the bartender because they are very nice and hook you up) and some food. cheeses, foccaccia, salami, brushetta, etc. The $ for the hotel is very good for where it is. In the area, there are plenty of bars, grills, restaurants etc. For business travelers, its about a $7 cab ride to the sears tower. The hotel is perfect for business or for traveling to visit chicago with a spouse. I will definitely be returning here!",5
981,"My experience with the Amalfi was great! I stayed there last year when I came to the city to look for housing for when I moved. We got a great deal booking online and were extremely happen we decided to stay there. The location is perfect. It is around anything you need and restaurants galore. The free cocktail hour was a very pleasant suprise. They had an extremely nice spread of food and drinks for this cocktail hour (including their house made ""Amalfitini""). They have fresh mozarella and proscuitto among many other things. When we went to the concierge to get a dinner recommendation, not only did she recommend something to us, but she knew someone at the restaurant and was able to get us 25% off our entire bill plus free dessert. That was a great perk! Other than that, the hotel is very nice and is a more modern looking style. I highly recommend this hotel.",5
982,"Stayed here last Tuesday on a business trip. My company booked this hotel so I wasn't too worried on the quality. Def. the pictures on the hotel website looked better than the actual hotel itself. But that's usually the case anyway. The hotel staff was really nice and had offered advice where to go to eat. The location wasn't too exciting - I didn't find to much to do around the hotel, but at least it was safe to walk around at night. The rooms were your average sized rooms. Nothing big and spectacular - the beds were comfy, and I loved the dual shower heads and the aveda products to use. They have a 24 hr business center, free wi-fi in the room, flat screen tv, books, cd's and magazines for you to use in the room, a decent fitness room (3 treadmills, 2 elliptical's, 2 stationary bikes, and free weights), a complimentary happy hour from 5:30-7 which has drinks, snacks that include meats, cheeses, and bread to snack on, continental breakfast in the morning set up by the elevators on every floor, and newspaper delivered to your room every morning. Overall, not a bad hotel. My only complaint I have with the hotel was that the view kinda sucked - it looked out to another building. Not a bad choice if you want to go with something other than the big chain hotels.",4
983,"The staff at this hotel are very well trained professionals. The Hotel itself is very discreet, private and unassuming. I stayed for a few nights in the earlier part of the year when it was a necessity. Their bar and food happy hour is something to look forward to each night. Anti pasto to rival any Italian B and B. good selection of beer and wine too. The beds are so accommodating and the view and location are excellent. I have stayed in many hotels around the world; this one is as impressive as any! On a side note you cannot compare this hotel to the Peninsula or Ritz Carlton. Do you compare a Toyota Matrix to a Mercedes Benz?",5
984,"Nice place.  Styling was standard hotel.  I found it interesting that the decor was so nondescript, almost like what you'd find in a dictionary picture for ""hotel"". Cocktail hour was really good, heavy appetizers like a big tray of meats and cheeses.  Their signature martinis were good.  The continental breakfast on each floor was great too, you can run to get a coffee and a muffin or croissant and back to the room to get started on your day. Front desk staff was great.  Saved us on cover charge at Andy's Jazz Club right around the corner with the hotel business card.  Everyone was really friendly.  Location is near a few river-north clubs, and we had a street-view room so it did get noisy right about closing time but only for a few minutes.  A lot of people were in town for a clothing show at the Merchandise Mart which is only about 4 blocks away.",4
985,"I didn't seek out the Amalfi.  This hotel is in same building as our Chicago office and, as such, we have a corporate rate.  So, it was convenience more than anything else.  However, this is a very nice hotel at an affordable rate in a good neighborhood close to a lot of things.  Good combination. The rooms are comfortable and of decent size.  Aside from the requisite TV, in-room entertainment includes several CD collections (mostly Jazz...fine by me!), books and a DVD player (DVDs available at reception.)  The bathrooms are large and offer good quality Aveda soaps and hair products.   Lots of free amenities.  In the mornings, there is a breakfast buffet set up on the credenza of each floor's elevator location.  Coffee, pastries, fruit, juice and the like are set up here from (I believe) 6:30-10.  During the week, from 5-7, there is a happy hour featuring antipasti selections and drinks, including the Amalfitini.  Wireless internet is also available.  Unfortunately, there isn't any free water (in-room Voss water is available for $5 and $7), but that is a very minor thing compared to all the other complimentary amenities.  There's also a workout room and business center, but I have used neither.  Parking is also pretty pricey, but I've never had to deal with that. Oh, almost forgot, they drop off chocolate truffles as part of the turndown service. During my last visit in February 2009, I saw that the lobby had been completely remodeled.  Apparently, by now, so have the rooms.  Hope to head out their soon so I can check them out.",5
986,"Note to self: When planning a last minute trip to Chicago, don't choose a weekend when 60,000 doctors are in town for a medical convention. For a quick family trip (my mom, dad and brother), we decided to head to Chicago to visit old friends. Unfortunately, because of the convention, every last hotel room in the city was booked. Finally, we were able to find one last room at the Amalfi Hotel. As a 20 something, the prospect of sharing one hotel room with my parents and my younger brother was frightening. Fortunately, the Amalfi made it an amazing experience. The room was spacious enough with it's 2 queen sized beds and large bathroom to accomodate us and our stuff. Upon check in the concierge remembered my mother from their phone conversation a few days prior and was so sweet, friendly and helpful. She gave us great recommendations for places to go for dinner and drinks which really made the trip all the more worthwhile. One of the best perks is the free happy hour from 5:30-7pm every night. They served tons of antipasti appetizers - cheeses, breads, olives, bruschetta, etc. They also had a bartender making any drink you wished. The complimentary breakfast was great too! They had one on every floor and served standard croissants, bagels, yogurt etc. The gym was also great - plenty of cardio equipment, free weights, and fun movies playing on the tv to keep you entertained. The location was great too, which a few bars and restaurants within a few blocks and the Magnificent Mile a few blocks more. This hotel had everything you needed and wanted for a place to stay in Chicago and great staff and amenities to make the trip even more pleasant. It's more of a boutique-y hotel then say, a giant Hyatt, but for me, that was exactly what I wanted. Thank you medical convention for forcing me to stay at what is now one my favorite hotels!",5
987,"1. IF YOU'RE HERE ON BUSINESS, IT'S OK.   2. IF YOU'RE HERE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN BUSINESS, MEH. Sorry for the caps, I just wanted to make it clear that this place can serve a purpose, but it shouldn't be your first choice for a nice stay with the Mr./Mrs. Good:  The staff is friendly, no problems there.  Rooms are spacious and clean.  90 min. freek cocktail time on weekdays is cool.  The beds are super comfy. Bad: The nicest part of the hotel is the lobby.  The rooms are way overpriced for what you get, a glorified Holiday Inn with a terribly-obstructed view.  There's no room service, they partner with Harry Caray's across the street till about 11pm and I hate Harry Caray's.  It costs $44 to park/valet your car here!  Park your own car at one of the self parks next to the hotel, trust me. All in all, not a horrible place, but you can do way better.  I recommend Hotel Sax a block south of this place if you're trying a romantic weekend/night.",2
988,"Lovely boutique hotel in River North, just blocks from  Wacker and Mich ave, and a quick walk to the L, countless restaurants, bars and the hub bub of the river. If given the option, I will always go boutique over chain, and will sacrifice a bit of room space for personal service and friendly touches. I thoroughly enjoy the breakfast spread on each floor by the elevators: no better way to start your day than with a complimentary orange juice, coffee and bagel while still in your plushy robe and slippers. The manager's cocktail and cheese reception each evening is a nice touch, although I am usually at a proper bar during this time frame. The property is immaculate with modern styling and chic touches that are simultaneously impressive and subtle, the service is wonderful and the location is great.  A+ on the ever important issue of bed comfort. - 1 star because, well it is a nice hotel, but it isnt a 5 star hotel. The internet was spotty, the TV could have been bigger and the room was on the smaller side. Still, extremely nice. Great value, ill see you next spring!",4
989,"We ended up in one of their modern themed rooms - and boy was it eclectic, and TOTALLY up my alley. It was on one of the higher floors, so the floor-to-ceiling view was an unexpected bonus - especially since we booked our summer Saturday night here on chance, not reading any reviews beforehand. I'm not sure if all the rooms were like the one we got, or if we just lucked out completely, but WOW. Modern yet comfortable furnishings. Large and spacious bathroom with colorful polka dots EVERYWHERE. And even though the room itself left little space to run around and do cartwheels, we were pleasantly happy with our stay. We got a good deal (price divided by 2), and it was a pedestrian friendly commute to and from the bar/club scene. Highly recommend this place as an alternative to the chain hotels/motels for an authentic and one-of-a-kind experience in the heart of Chi-town. Request one of the 'modern rooms' to be amazed at how a fun duvet cover can change your hotel experience!",5
990,"Bring your Ipod because they have an Ihome/alarm clock/Ipod player  to blast your music while you browse through the free internet -- Yes, none of that $14.95 b.s. internet charge/day. Complimentary breakfast  AND cocktails-hors d'oeuvre? You can check out DVD's downstairs and watch them in your room. (and no, not THAT type of DVDs). They offered door-to-door chocolates service after happy hour. We got lucky, our room is right in front of the work out room. Overall, I've been here for 3 hours already and I'm loving it here. Its a  smaller hotel than the Marriott (where we stayed last time in Chicago)- which I find it to be an advantage on customer service and attentiveness. I think the staff -job title being  ""Experience Designer, Information Specialist, Convenience Architect, Maestro "" to be a little pretentious but I can't complain because they made reservations for us to TRU so we can blow $250/person. The view is pretty lame but the plasma television compensates the view of someone's living room. Location is good; Michigan Avenue is overrated so I do not mind staying a few blocks away from Miracle Mile. A block or two away from The House of Blues. I don't know what people are talking about when they mentioned Amalfi  is in 'desperate need of an upgrade'  because, its clean, sleek and chic hotel.  Designer wallpaper throughout the room, granite counter top in the bathroom, dual high pressure shower head and ladies-- a little vanity chair for you to apply your make-up. CDs and books in the room for your pleasure. Robes and slippers for you to lounge around in (or not...its not like anyone can see through your window) $300/night during our May 28- June 3rd stay. (for a conference) $5-$7 Voss water. Highly recommended.",5
991,"Really nice hotel with a very nice, accommodating staff. They were extremely helpful with early check-in and late check-out in order to meet the needs of my schedule. Staff was friendly, room was clean, free breakfast (always a plus!), prime location in the heart of downtown and new appliances (TV, iPod speaker system, etc.). Would definitely recommend Amalfi and will likely be staying there again in the near future.",5
992,"Great location & value!  The rooms were clean and nicely arranged, the staff was friendly and helpful. My friend and I took advantage of their free breakfast every day.  It was pretty good with croissants, danishes, juice, milk, tea, coffee, oranges, apples, etc.  Their happy hour is nice, too.  I only caught it once, but good drinks & snacks. The location is fantastic.  We were only a short walk across the bridge from our conference.  There's good restaurants nearby.  Good stuff!",4
993,"This place is cute, but some minor inconveniences made my stay less enjoyable and I won't go back. 1. No blackout curtains in the room.  Just a sheer curtain and those fake side panels that you can't pull closed. Nothing to block out the street lamp outside the window. 2. We were the lucky guests who didn't have a do not disturb sign, which we didn't realize until the maid was banging (literally, banging) on the door at 8am. 3. People were screaming in the hallway at 3am. Not the hotel's fault, but knowing that they attract that certain demographic makes me not want to stay there again.",3
994,"Ooh, bf and I love the Amalfi. Please don't get too busy and make it harder to get a room here! First off, you're in a really prime location. Quiet street, but an easy walk to Whole Foods, nightlife, and the major conference hotels. Next, the rooms are great. They are immaculate, quiet, and equipped with highly effective ""black-out"" curtains. In addition, you're going to get a solid breakfast and a wonderful happy hour! Each night, on two floors, the bartenders and snackys come out and you can drink to your heart's content. A great idea, and a wonderful start to an evening in expensive Chicago.",5
995,this place is pretty skanky. i hope i never have to do that again.,2
996,"I spent 4 nights at the Amalfi Hotel while in Chicago for training. The rooms are very nice and clean. There is a continental breakfast on every floor with good coffee. They offer free use of the business center for those of us behind the times without a Blackberry or laptop. There were also free cocktails from 5:30 to 7:00 pm every day. The rooms were clean and comfy. The fitness center was on the same floor as my room but there was nothing to wipe down the machines with after use so I suggest bringing your own wipes. All in all, after 4 long days, it was a comfortable place to stay.",4
997,"Located in River North, the Amalfi Hotel is in an excellent location. You can walk to House of Blues, great food, and shopping. The El is about a block away. The hotel is very well decorated with modern furniture and design. Unfortunately, you need to be lucky to get a good view. The hotel is surrounded by brick buildings and you're more likely to be staring into an alley instead of the skyline.",4
998,"I prefer boutique hotels above chain hotels, and at the price point, the Amalfi is a fantastic value. The interior is trendy, but not obnoxious, the rooms are well appointed and sizable for a downtown hotel. The bathrooms are fabulous!   My complaints about the hotel are pretty minor. They have teeny little closets and itsy bitsy drawer space. I hate not being able to unpack. And I never realized how important room service was until I had to wander the halls looking for coffee. Seriously, providing me with coffee in the morning is in everyone's best interest.  Don't make me get dressed and talk to random strangers in order to get coffee.) Those quibbles aside, the staff was magnificent, the room was nice, and the price point was more than reasonable for a hotel with such a great location. If someone would bring me coffee and a muffin in the morning, I would be a regular visitor.",4
999,"I travel to Chicago about once a month for work, and I always try to stay at the Amalfi if possible.  It is a boutique hotel (so no reward points), and the check-in area is a bit unconventional, but the service and amenities here are always great.  The rooms are on the small side, but they're adorably decorated and stocked with Aveda products.  I take *really* hot showers, and I've never had problems with the heat or water pressure here.  The workout room is very easy to find and set up nicely, with multiple treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and cable tv. During my first stay, I was surprised by the fact that there are no vending machines in the building.  The rooms are stocked with ungodly expensive designer bottled water, but luckily, there's a 7-11 right around the corner where you can grab your necessaries.  Room service comes from Harry Caray's across the street; it's not great, but there are plenty of better dinner options in the River North area within walking distance (I recommend eating at the bar at Frontera Grill).  I do appreciate their complimentary continental breakfast, which is available on every floor.  The selection isn't mind-blowing or anything, but you can get baked goods and fresh fruit, which is all I really ask for. The best part is that I've never had to spend over $179/night on a stay here!  The Amalfi's not the cheapest place in town, but if you do your research and get on their mailing list, you do tend to hear about their deals and specials.",5
1000,"I've stayed at The Amalfi many times since it first opened. The main reason is that it is centrally located right in the heart of downtown; 3 blocks from The Merchandise Mart where I usually work and only slightly further from all the fabulous shopping on Michigan Avenue. Conveniently located right across the street from Harry Carreys and right next door to Keefers...both great choices for food and drink. My only problem is that the hotel is in desperate need of an upgrade...it literally hasn't changed since I first stayed here 5 days ago. Still, the best value for any hotel in this location!",4
1001,"It's weird staying at a hotel in a city you live or used to live in.  ""Am I now one of those tourists who would annoy the hell out of me as I went about my daily life?"" you think to yourself.  Actually, it's kind of cool being a tourist in your own hometown.  It gives you a fresh perspective, as I learned while staying at the Amalfi: 1. There are no patches of grass in River North (only noticeable if you have to walk a dog). 2. There are a lot of hotels in River North (why didn't I notice this when I lived in Chicago?). 3. Despite the fact that it's a tourist trap, the nearby House of Blues hosts some great acts (blues and non-blues). 4. The Chicago River (and the buildings along it) at night is still a damn gorgeous sight to behold. 5. It's fun to be a tourist in a city you know how to get around. Staying at the Amalfi was also a fresh experience, as I had never been at a ""boutique hotel"" before: 1. It has a mod lobby in orange and turquoise.  No floral upholstery here! 2. Hotel staff wear clothing that matches the hotel decor (I'm serious!). 3. Free FRESH breakfast is provided.  I could have stashed a couple of those chocolate croissants and slices of cinnamon bread in my bag. 4. Cleaning staff are friendly.  Actually, this is not a good thing because I hate having someone clean up after me.  So I always clean up before the cleaning staff clean.  No, it does not make sense. 5. No extra fee is charged for having a pet. 6. Free cocktails and appetizers are provided in the evenings.  I'm still dreaming about the skinny breadsticks with sundried tomato and black bean and corn dips. 7. Cost was reasonable.  I always compare to the Federal government per diem rates for lodging, which tend to be on the low side, and the special rates at Amalfi were actually lower.",4
1002,"I saw a LOT of great reviews for this place, so instead of staying at the Westin, where I always stay, I decided to give the Amalfi a shot. And as my Two Stars state, ""Meh. I've experienced better. The 'great selection' of jazz disks, consisted of one beat-up easy listening CD. And the books in the room to read were ""Night Shift"" by Steven King and another title that was obviously forgettable. Nothing like staying contemporary. The room was whatever. No big deal. The continental breakfast was good only because it was 10 feet away from my room near the elevator, but it was lackluster. Although I will say for a place that's crankin' out a lot of coffee, theirs was actually pretty good. Another let down was the free happy hour with cocktails and food (which appeared to be cold cuts) in the 'lounge' -- which in reality was a windowless room with one TV, and a kitchen area cut into the wall. Not much vibe. But the best was that I actually ran out of HOT WATER. In a hotel. I repeat, my hotel room shower, ran...out...of...hot...water. Overall, it was clean, the people were nice and it was close to my clients' office, but it was definitely a let down. Sorry Amalfi.",2
1003,"Great location, nice decor, and complimentary breakfast! It's within walking distance to Hubbard street where there are many bars and the shops on Michigan Ave. The complimentary breakfast is on each floor and we had coffee, donuts, and croissants. They also had fruit, bagels, and juice. My friend who forgot her razor and toothbrush, asked the front desk for these items and they promptly provided them. I would definitely stay here again. I booked my room thru Orbitz and got a good deal, they have better rates than the Amalfi website.",4
1004,"Any hotel with an ""experience designer"" must be worth at least 4 stars ;).  My stay at the Amalfi was quite pleasant.  They have a great customer service department here and I love the fact that they sat at desks instead of behind a HUGE counter like most hotels.   We had a room with 2 queen sized beds in it.  Not big by any stretch of the imagination, but for $145 in downtown Chicago, it certainly seemed like a deal.   The location is great from what I could tell.   I did find the bathroom a bit puzzling.  I'm not sure if it was a handicap room or something, but the bathroom shower all drained into the center of the room - there was no bath at all.  There was also a bunch of poles to help you stand up if needs be.   Overall, I wouldn't hesitate coming back here again.",4
1005,"Check-in is a bit weird (one small desk with one or two dudes behind it), but other than that this was a pretty nice place.  Supposedly they offer some high end concierge services but I didn't take advantage. Continental breakfast is meh, but at least it's on every floor.   The main downside of this place is that the damn Harry Caray bar thing is right across the street.  I happened to have the room that looked directly at it.  Freaked me out. I might try the W next time, I dunno.",4
1006,"I stayed at the Amalfi when I was in Chicago for a conference and thought it was a lovely hotel. The staff was all very friendly. The rooms were clean and cozy. There was a continental breakfast set up on a credenza near the elevators on each floor in the morning which was awesome. I went out in my PJs and brought breakfast back to my room. There was also a free happy hour that they hold each day for guests that included picky foods like cheese, crackers, meats, hummus. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.",5
1007,"I'll start with the negative, just to get it out of the way of the heaps of praise coming... I am very light sleeper; if you are not, completely disregard the next paragraph. This hotel is noisy.  Not so much from other rooms/hallways - but the outside noise was awful.  We were in staying in the back of the hotel with our window facing the alley, and at random times throughout the night (sometime multiple times) garbage trucks would come along and smash and crash through the approx 30-40 garbage bins lining the alley.  After enduring the clanging a couple of nights, I asked to be moved to a room at the front of the hotel, but was told that there was nothing there in the same price range (apparently you pay more for a ""non-alley view"").  But after another couple of sleepless nights, we were finally moved to another room.  It was on a lower floor, on the front side of the hotel and was definitely better without the gargabe trucks, but still suffered from late-night party goer noise. Other than that - this hotel was fantastic! Nicely decorated, high end bath products and double shower heads.  The continental breakfast was good, more than adequate, but the real kicker is the nightly manager's reception.  Wow.  High end booze and fancy snacks (hummous, bruscetta, meat & cheese, etc).  The hotel signature drink, the Amalfitini, is addictive.  Don't be surprised if you wobble out of there after downing 4 or 5 of them - they go down so easy. The staff were friendly, and our room was cleaned every day before we returned from our touring (coming back to a still-dirty room is a major pet peeve of mine). And the location is fantastic - walking distance to countless bars and restaurants, and so many of the city sights. The Amalfi is a great hotel (just bring ear plugs).",4
1008,"5 stars all the way. This was my first time staying in the River North area, and I wasn't sure how convenient it would be, but I am so glad I stayed here! My room did not have jazz and soul music like other yelpers have posted, but they did have a few award-winning novels, which I thought was unique. I used the business center to print out my boarding pass. They have a new Mac desktop! For those of you that can't get up early enough for the awesome free breakfast, there is an Einstein Bros Bagels across the street. can't wait to go back!",5
1009,"This is a very nice hotel in a central location for a decent price! I just returned from my thanskgiving holiday in Chicago and was very happy there. Staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and the free extras are great: free breakfast, free internet, free cocktails and antipasti in the lounge on the sixth floor, and every room has a collection of jazz and soul music that you can play over the dvd player. It is a five minute walk to the Magnificent Mile and a very nice 15 Minute walk to Millenium Park. I loved Chicago, and this hotel was part of my experience - a real deal for what it has to offer.",4
1010,"Weekend trip to Chicago to drop off students at the School of the Arts Institute Chicago. Positives: - Excellent location - The Loop - Walking distance to most everything - Millenium Park a few blocks away - The ""El"" nearby - Many great restaurants - Boutique style hotel - similar to Kimpton - Very nice decor - Snack bar with fee - DVDs available for viewing - Decent view - Friendly and helpful staff - Breakfast available in the elevator lobby of each floor - Donuts, pastries, bagels, yogurt, juice, coffee - all of a higher quality Negatives: - Pricing - I was able to get a corporate rate thru my employer @ $239.00/nite - Bottled water available for a fee - Our room was close to the elevator lobby, so a little noisy - very bearable Not many negatives, really. We had great weather and good temperatures. Loved Chicago.",4
1011,"I ended up at Amalfi because one of the bigger river hotels messed up my reservations.  Lets just say it was classic bait and switch, not so renaissance I'd say.  Great place, great free evening appetizers and drinks and the staff were extremely nice.  The breakfast buffet on every floor was a great touch and very convenient for the working professional - this so-called professional was back home for a conference.  This is probably a redundant review as seeing that everyone seems to write about the same thing but I can attest as well to all the great hype.  Love the location, love the hotel.",5
1012,"Great boutique hotel in the heart of everything! The rooms are modern, very clean and the beds super comfy. Great views from the higher floors. The staff was amazing, very accommodating. Two top favorites: AMAZING shower heads and free happy hour! Quite impressed :)",5
1013,"I reserved a block of rooms for my wedding here. Loal Porter was my contact and was very helpful anytime I had a question and was prompt with emails. The hotel itself was very nice. Staff was friendly, the lobby and rooms were always spotless and you can't beat its location. The complimentary breakfast on each floor is a nice touch too. I highly recommend staying at the Amalfi.",5
1014,"Our stay at the Amalfi was fabulous in nearly every possible way!   -The location is terrific-River North but very close to the loop.  There are several close L stops.  Use Clark/Lake if you're arriving via CTA from the airport.  It's almost as close as State/Lake but Clark has escalators and is a larger, easier to navigate station when you're dragging luggage.  The walk to the hotel is pleasant and short. -We spent little time in the lobby but did like the deskside check in.  It's a lot more personal and relaxing than the typical ""wait in line to stand at the counter for 10 minutes"" check-in. -Our room was great!  We had an extremely comfortable king bed. The bed linens were soft and cozy.  There were plenty of pillows and the padded headboard was comfortable to prop against for reading or tv watching.  The bathroom was large and clean.  The Aveda toiletries were really nice.  The bathroom had a large counter, lots of floor area, and a lighted make up mirror.  The tub was a standard tub but had a double shower head and a curved shower curtain rod to help with that ""closed in"" feeling.  My only complaint about the bathroom was that the towels were a bit on the rough/scratchy side rather than fluffy and soft. -We were on the 4th floor overlooking Harry Carray's restaurant.  There was some noise bleeding in from outside but it was street and traffic noise, not bar goers or pedestrians.  IMO, it was similar to the noise level in any downtown hotel when you're only a few floors above street level.  We had a view of the Trump and the Marina Towers.  Not like having a spectaular skyline view but it certainly wasn't a bad view. -We loved the complimentary breakfast.  The breakfast was a couple of steps up from a typical continental breakfast.  There were a variety of pastries, bagels, doughnuts, cereal, yogurt, and fresh whole fruit.  Milk, apple juice, and orange juice were available as well as tea and coffee.  The coffee was really quite good and it was great to be able to get refills so easily. -We also really enjoyed the free drinks and appetizers each evening at the cocktail reception.  They have a nice selection of premium liquor, two white wines, two reds, two beers, and two pre-mixed specialty cocktails.  It's a small bar so they don't have every possible option but the selection is adequate.  And c'mon-it's FREE.  The food is good if largely unchanging.  Each night there was a selection of Italian cold meats, breads, cheese, and other antipasto standards-olives, artichoke hearts, peppers, etc.  One night they had Caprese salad and it was delicious.  The lounge is rather small.  If the hotel is crowded, I doubt everyone would have a seat.  We were there at an uncrowded time and one night it was still very hard to find a seat. -The business center was well-appointed with several computers (both Macs and Dells) and a quality, fast printer.  It made printing our boarding passes easier than just about anywhere I've ever stayed. -The staff was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  When we had spotty wireless reception (which is included, by the way), they were very responsive and sent an ""engineer"" up right away to investigate the issue. -Our only real complaint was with the televisions in the rooms.  We had cold, wet weather and spent our evenings mostly relaxing in our room.  The (smallish) flat screen tvs were a disappointment.  There were no HD channels, multiple pay or ""hotel"" channels, and the reception was spotty.  Also, the remote was awful and it was excruciatingly slow changing channels or even turning up the volume!  There was a dvd player with a (small, quite limited) selection of dvds to ""check out"" in the lobby-nice touch but it wouldn't hurt to update and enlarge the library. Overall we had a wonderful, relaxing stay at the Amalfi and will recommend it to friends and family.  I hope we'll be able to return sometime soon!",5
1015,"Similar to many of the other reviews, the Amalfi has many strong points and a few drawbacks.  The room was comfortable enough and I liked the fresh colors and contemporary feel.  The jazz and soul music collections are a nice touch.  I really enjoyed the cocktail reception with the appetizers and signature drink, the Amalfitini.  The continental breakfast served on each floor was also well done.  Finally, the location is central to many of the popular downtown destinations. I'd have given the Amalfi 4 stars if not for a couple problems.  First the room, while appealing in decor, looked a little like it had been done on the cheap.  Some of the furnishings looked good but didn't have the level of quality as comparable hotels.  Plus, the carpet was really dirty in spots.  Since the place is really new, I suspect it's going to look worn before long.  There is no view as others pointed out, and the street noise can be troubling.  Finally, we had a billing issue where the rate didn't match what we'd booked on the internet.  We got it worked out but it punctuated a decent but not great stay. The overall value can be really good if you get a favorable rate.  If not, and you want an interesting newer place to stay in the same neighborhood, try the Hotel Sax.",3
1016,we went last weekend to Chicago for my friend's wedding. good location but the rooms were just ok for the price paid. breakfast in the morning was great and so was the cocktail hour (free :) all in all 3 stars - would stay here again,3
1017,"I will never ever stay anywhere else in Chicago...ever.  I've been coming here for about 5 years and every year it gets better and better.  Just today we came for an anniversary stay, and they were so thoughtful that there was a lovely card and treat in the room when we got here. That is on top of the amazing staff, great lounge, and great breakfast in the morning.  Best hotel I have ever stayed in, hands down.  Thank you to the wonderful people here:). Consistent incredible service-hige kudos to the concierge!",5
1018,"i gotta be honest, my bullshit detector was twitching when i learned that the folks at the front desk are not 'clerks' but 'experience consultants'. think of the amalfi as a 'mini-w hotel'. it's hip and comfortable and (unlike the w maybe) an incredible value considering the location. it's right across the street from harry caray's so I can look out my window anytime i want and see a huge cartoon of harry practically ordering me to have a beer. ah, harry, the master enabler. strangely, i find comfort in this. in the room, i like the cd/dvd player with assorted jazz and blues cds, some novels and magazines (gq, instyle and others). i didn't particularly like the robe they provide. it's made out of strangely uncomfortable materials and was on the small side. hotel robes should be soft terry cloth. period. and large. i think in the effort for maximum hipness, they erred. nice FREE happy hour (not just wine and beer. well drinks, skyy vodka, jim beam, etc)  and continental breakfast. interesting to note that the breakfast is on every floor...so you can run out into the hall in your odd robe and grab a chocolate croissant and fruit and scamper back. i will happily stay here again!",4
1019,"This is a cute little boutique hotel right in the heart of River North that is a wonderful value for the price.  I would not say that it should get five stars, because it is certainly not on the caliber with a Peninsula, or another 5 star hotel, but for the cost it is a great value. I enjoy staying at boutique hotels because they offer unique extras: although the Amalfi doesn't have its own bar, they have a complimentary happy hour on weekend nights with wine, limoncello martinis, and bar nibbles.  They have cd players with complimentary jazz and world music, cool decor, and a nice sized bathroom.  We found our room on expedia for about $150 a night; unbelievably cheap considering the value you receive.  It's also right in the middle of many great bars and restaurants.  Great place for a fun getaway in the city; it's a nice 3.5 to 4 star hotel for a great price.",4
1020,"Nice rooms, comfy bed, good views, awesome shower.  The staff was excellent, though I dealt with them very minimally. Definitely worth the money if you want a plush hotel room without all the super fancy extras.",5
1021,"Modern, cozy, refined and wonderful boutique hotel. Thank you for the most cozy night. DM. Great continental breakfast with wonderful carbs (bagels, breads, muffins), fruit, and juices. Great location, wonderful service and modern decor. xoxo",5
1022,"Overview: --Overrated hotel in a premium location. The Great: --Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. The Good: --Inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --Nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. The Mediocre: --Room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street. --Free cocktails 5-7pm in ""lounge"" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --Hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. Pressure is pretty low. --View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. The Bad: --Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. Same deal for my iPhone. I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --No blackout curtains! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at. --Noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. And the remote was useless. --In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. Don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. Summary: --Not recommended. Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star.",2
1023,"I agree, five stars. The staff was very friendly, professional and quick. They had the perfect recommendations for sightseeing, dining and drinking. Hangover cure breakfast @ 1 pm - the Temple Cafe was the right suggestion. The room was modern and sleek, with the most comfortable bed out of any hotel I have stayed at (and I travel for work plenty). Continental breakfast on every floor - thus allowing the guests to sneak out in pjamas, grab delicious fluffy croissants, and run away back to the room. The location was perfect - minutes from the CTA, right next to the river, and walking distance to many sights, Mag Mile, dinning and boozing. Yay Amalfi...thanks for the wonderful time.",5
1024,"I enjoyed my stay at the Amalfi hotel. The only thing that I did not like about it was the lady who sits at the desk and greets/checks people in. She was kind of aloof and distant. Then later there was another woman at the front desk area who seemed the same way. That was weird to me. The hotel though was nice. They had some magazines,which I love, waiting in the room for me, some CDs, and a very nice robe to lounge around in. The bed was very nice. I could have fallen asleep in it seconds after my head hit the pillow.  Oh yea, and I cant forget the the happy hour. The drinks were not all watered down as I would have expected. They were pretty good and top notch. I'd stay here again for sure.",4
1025,"This was the spot i went to religiously. Stayed a couple nights every month for over a year until I decided to branch out and hit some other properties. Great location just north of the river. Walking distance to all manner of activities. Nice lobby , always a friendly staff from the doorman to the guy that works the happy hour.Rooms are standard size and beds are comfy. Get a corner room if you can its got a different layout and seems to be quieter than a regular room. Corner suite was rocken like dokken. This place also has a free happy hour from 5:30 to 7 every nite except i think Sunday. Nothing brings people out like free food and booze. Get there early and watch people descend like locusts. I once saw someone have their wedding reception at the free happy hour. Crazy! No restaurant on site but Keefer's and Harry Carey's , great steakhouse-see my review on that , are down the block. Dozens of restaurants within a couple blocks too. No pool either but that doesn't bother me Its a sweet hotel and I recomend it to anyone going to Chicago",5
1026,"The staff was wonderful and eager to help.  A minor billing issue was resolved promtly and professionally.  Our room was lovely.  Probably best for business travellers and the like, but a great experience nonetheless.",4
1027,"We stayed here two and a half years ago when we were apartment hunting before moving to the city.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Every night there is a happy hour buffet of delicious food appetizers - a lot of them Italian like fresh mozzarella and olives and bruschetta.  They also have a server making drinks, including their specialty, the Amalfitini, made with lemoncello.  When we stayed there we had asked at the front desk for a resonably priced restaurant recommendation.  The concierge recommended a delicious restaurant and since she knew someone who worked there, set us up with 25% off the meal and free desserts as well.",5
1028,"Our experience was all around great.  We loved the location which is close to the river, and we were able to walk everywhere downtown or hop on a bus or train quickly.  The staff was really friendly and I usually won't even look at free ""continental"" breakfast, but theirs was really nice.  They even refreshed it numerous times so it wasn't like if the family with ten kids shows up right before you, you are screwed.  I loved the decor of the rooms and was inspired by their color choices in the bathroom.  I would definitely stay there again.",5
1029,"This ais a great place to stay if doing business in the River North area.  Clean and comfortable rooms, freindly and helpful staff, a great restaurant just through the lobby for those cold nights you don't want to venture outside in and a nice continental breakfast on each floor.  You can sneak out in your pjs and bring coffee and fresh fruit & pastries back to your room.  Great value for the price.  Will definitely return!",4
1030,"I stayed in this hotel the first time I came to Chicago for a college visit. It is precisely why I am moving to Chicago in a few days. When we first arrived there, the doorman greeted us and took our bags (surprisingly, thats not done much in DC) and guided us to the front desk. All of the staff we spoke to were very polite and helpful. They gave us great recommendations on where to go to for food, and advised us on how to travel when we return to the city. The hotel was quite beautiful, and very comfortable. Our rooms were a few doors down from the free happy hour and breakfast sites so my parents were pretty satisfied. The only reason I give it four stars is because the view kind of blows, but that is no reason to totally down this hotel.",4
1031,"My Boyfriend and I stayed for 2 nights and our total bill was about $250. Not bad at all! Our room was great, I mean it's no Ritz-Carlton, but it was perfect for it's price. Everything was clean and orderly and I wasn't grossed out at all. Although we were only there for 2 days, we went to their gym so we didn't feel too guilty about all the Chicago-style pizza we just scarfed down our throats and it wasn't too shabby. We never ate the complimentary breakfast, but we did see it and it look delicious, and what is there to complain about if it's free! On the last day we had to check out at noon, but our flight didn't leave until about 7pm and we still wanted to walk around so we asked the front desk if they could hold it for us and they were pretty nice about it. My only complaint is that a couple of the front desk guys were pretty snooty/douchy, but the all the girls at the front desk and the bellhops were really friendly. This place is perfectly located too. If I ever go back to Chicago, I will definitely be staying here again!",4
1032,"The Amalfi is a very nice hotel.  my wife and i spent my birthday downtown wining and dining.  we then retired to the Amalfi Hotel.  it's a very nice stay.  the room was different than others.  they've added a lot of nice touches.  the only reason i am not giving it another star is cause i really like architecture.  i wanted more.  Italian contemporary can really be wonderful.  we got free drinks at 5:30 and the drinks were great.  the bar atmosphere was not there.  i had already imagined what the hotel would be like from their website and i wanted a swank, fancy bar. the breakfast was specacular.  great choices in coffee and breakfast items.  very kind and helpful service at the front desk.  again, the front desk could have been a real beautiful room.  it is my disappointment and not their short-coming.  the Amalfi's rates are considerably more reasonable than the Peninsula or the Four Seasons.  honestly, stay at the Amalfi before you go to one of the larger chains, if money were not an issue, i'd stay at the Peninsula. cheers",4
1033,"I really, really wanted to like Amalfi.  For some reason, I keep booking room in boutique hotels thinking that they'll have a chip on their shoulder to really try to impress their customers.  This, however, has not been my experience. We were in Chicago on business and needed to use the printer in the business center.  I called ahead before we even booked and asked about their business center.  They assured me that they had building-wide wifi as well as a printer that guests could use. When we arrived, I attempted to print 4 sheets of paper for an upcoming meeting.  The page was streaked.  Printer read: Change Black Ink.  So I called down, thinking it would be no big deal, and they happily said they would send someone up.  Okay.  I left for the meeting and went about my day.  The next day I went down to the business center and the printer was doing the same thing.  They never changed the cartridge.  I called the front desk and they assured me again that they would send someone up.  2 hours later, nothing had changed.  I called again and they said I could use the front desk's printer.  I went down and they very nicely printed off about 15 pages for me (though it was odd that the guy at the desk wanted to log into my email account himself... ""okay, what's your password.""   Umm, no.  The next day I went down to the business center to print our boarding passes -- three guys in suits are in there complaining about how the printer is streaking and says it needs a new cartridge.  Ridiculous. The wifi in the building is a joke. I was on the 6th floor and couldn't get a signal.  If you're on the 4th floor (where the business center is), then you might get one, so request that floor.  They had to send up an ethernet cable for me to connect to the internet. Finally, the breakfast was lame.  I understand you want to be able to advertise ""free breakfast,"" but the food was generally stale, especially the bagels.  It was nice to have free coffee, so I can't complain about it that much since I'm not big on breakfast.  If you are expecting even the equivalent of a Hampton Inn, you'll be dismayed. Despite this, the rooms were pretty nice and I have no complaints there.  If you're here for business, I can't recommend Amalfi.  ""Meh. I've experienced better"" pretty much sums up my experience at Amalfi.",2
1034,This is definitely my favorite hotel!  I love all the decor in the lobby and in the rooms.  The service is always excellent.  The rooms are are really roomy and the bathrooms are huge for a hotel.  The cocktail hour is always nice and I love the Amalfitini!  Continental breakfast the next day is great since I don't usually eat a large breakfast.  The chocolate croissants are my favorite and the coffee is really good!  We'll be going back for sure!,5
1035,This is a pleasant change from your big chain hotel groups. Very European and very comfortable. You can find some good deals at this great location. The rooms are basic and clean. The hotel location is excellent so you can walk to shops and restaurants. You have at least three good restaurants on the same block as the hotel. Very good price/value relationship.,4
1036,"This is the only hotel I will stay at in Chicago. For one it has basics that some hotels might make you pay for - gym and internet. Second, there are perks - breakfast on the floor every day, and happy hour drinks. Finally, the foyer and rooms are beautiful and the location is fantastic. I think the price is reasonable too.",4
1037,"I stayed here one night with my girlfriend. First, the good: The location is great and the River North area is blowing up so there are good bars and restaurants within walking distance. The bed was really comfy. The breakfast bar was nice. Quiet room. Now the bad: I expected the rooms to be nicer, but they had a spiced up Holiday Inn quality and came across as a bit dingy. The view was awful. The happy hour is nice, but way too crowded and not really worth it unless you're a huge cheapskate (not judging). But all in all, a nice place, especially if you can find a good deal online.",3
1038,"My husband and I read the reviews before we arrived and so our expectations were high to start with... and yet.... the hotel and the super friendly staff completely surpassed our expectations.  The hotel is sleek and stylishly designed and you cannot get a more helpful and friendly staff than they have.  Aside from the free Wi-Fi, their business center has 4 computers (one of them is a Mac) and a printer and they don't nickle and dime you.  The breakfast is good but their complimentary happy hour at their lounge totally blow your socks off -- full bar, they have signature cocktails and real food like antipasta buffet.  We definitely will stay there next time we are in town.",5
1039,"The rooms are nice.  I want a corner room some time when we stay there again.  Walking distance (meaning within a mile) of so much!  We walked to Navy Pier and the Magnificent mile and even home from Soldier Field but that was more like 2.5 miles.  If you stay here go to the Purple Pig which is 0.4 miles from the hotel.  Get the Eggplant and Goat Cheese Spread.  YUM! YUM! YUM!  They have continental breakfast set up on every floor with is such a brilliant idea and really was a great touch.  Sadly, the pastries are not good.  It is a real shame because there are so many great options in Chicago which I am sure wouldn't be that much more expensive and would leave more of an impression.   The gym has nice sturdy machines which we didn't use because that is not how we vacation.  The bed was wonderful.  We will be staying here again.  $44 a day for valet is a huge negative but we didn't see where it was any cheaper anywhere else in that area.  If somebody knows of a better option/place to leave a car we won't be using all week please send me a message and let me know.  Don't want to pay that bill again.  They did do it fairly though and charged by 24 hours instead of calendar day which we really appreciated.",4
1040,"I recently stayed at The Almalfi and it was just so-so. I am not quite in-line with the other reviews here. It was a hotel, but nothing special, particularly for the price it was charging. It's fairly nicely located for tourist (such as myself) but you still have to walk a few blocks to really find anything. The room was decent, nothing special. Lobby is really small. Service was so-so. Gym was not that great. There's no fan and it's fairly stuffy and hot. Would I stay there again? Perhaps, but I would definitely look else where for.",3
1041,"We decided last minute to head to the city for the weekend. We did the usuall research and shopping on travel sites and came across the Amalfi. We prefer boutique type hotels over the huge mainstream hotels in the city, a couple of our other favs (the W, Dana and Wit) were sold out. The Almalfi had an advertised rate of $199 per night for the weekend...almost too cheap so we did more research just to make sure, read lots of great reviews so we booked it. When we arrived we checked in with what might have been record time for hotel check-in, it took all of about 1 minute or less. The Lobby is small but beautifuly decorated. When we opened the door to our rom we were pleasantly suprised, we were on the the top floor with a pretty decent view up and down State St. The room was on the small side but very clean, very nice decor and a comfy bed and a large bathroom big enough for two people to get ready at the same time. All in all an ultra bargain for a weekend room in Chicago. Our $199 per night rate included their complimentary happy hour cocktails in the lounge every night from 5:00-7:00pm as well as complimentary continental breakfast on each floor every morning. The hotel staff was helpfull and friendly and housekeeping did a great job. There are nicer places in the city but nothing in this price range will compare. The hotel and price paired with the great River North location on State St has pushed the Amalfi to the top of our Chicago hotel list. We will be back for sure.",4
1042,"I stayed at the Amalfi while in town on business with a little weekend of pleasure.   Cute Boutique Hotel Location:  Great location near the River and 3 blocks from Michigan behind the new Trump Tower.  I walked everywhere from up and down Michigan toward the Loop and Mill. Park.   Check In:  I flew in early on Sat morning and my mother flew in that morning too, as we were coming from different cities.  She arrived at the hotel about 9am.  I really didn't expect to check in but at least hold our bags there and give us a place to meet up.  Mother called me and said the lady at the desk said she could check in if her name was on the reservation.  I called when I landed and spoke to the front desk and gave them the OK to let mom check in.  VERY NICE of them to let us check in at 9am!! I arrived and preceded up to the room.   Room:  The original Room they let my mother check into was not the Corner King we had booked.  It was fine, and very nice of them to let us check in that early, but I had paid more for the upgrade. So I went down to the desk and asked the lady if there was a corner king available?  If not, not a big deal as long as she could credit me the difference in price for the room. They ended up giving us a Corner King that was nice.  It was not available until later so they let us keep our stuff in the other room, while we went out for the day, and then upgraded us when we returned from shopping. The Corner King was nice.  Extremely comfortable beds, the windows around the whole room were nice, but a lot to close up at night.  Nice views, much better than the original room where we looked into another building.  I will say other than the corridor where you walked into the room, space wise it wasn't that much different than the original room.  Not really worth the upgrade unless you want the better view and all the natural light. Breakfast and the Happy hour was a great touch.  Fruit and bagels for breakfast with your choices of juices, coffee, and tea.  nothing special but perfect for us. The Free Happy Hour was very nice - they had Sky and Belvedere Vodka, Jim Beam, Captain Morgan, and others.  White and Red wines and a couple Italian beer selections.  Nice little apps too.  anti-pasta setup, cheeses, and breads. Service - lightbulb was out in the room and I called and someone came up in 5 minutes and replaced it. We did receive turndown service the 2nd night and they left a chocolate on the pillow, very nice. Lobby isn't anything much, but why do you need it to be..... Bellmen were very helpful in directions to a drug store and transportation. I typically stay at the Wyndham in Chicago but I think I will be changing to the Amalfi now.",4
1043,"Five stars all the way.  Where to start????   The service is awesome from the valet to the reservations.  From Check in to check out .  One word CLEAN!  Continental breakfast on every floor!  Free drinks and small appetizers from 5:30 to 7.  Location location location... this small boutique hotel is right around the corner form the hustling Hubbard street clubs. One block from the House of Blues, Bin 36, Flatwater, Keefers, 10 Pin etc....  across from Harry Carry's next to Red Fish.  Ten minutes from everything!!!   The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to get out of it.  They have every amenity and when we needed something and had to call for it, it took like two minutes for it to arrive!   There was even a men's bathroom on the floor we were on.  so when the women were in the suite's bathroom, we could go right down the hall and use the facilities.  awesome!  The decor was really hip too!",5
1044,"I stayed at this hotel with family over Thanksgiving.  I had not only never heard of it, I couldn't figure out where it was even knowing that ""it's across the street from Harry Carry's"".  It is small (only 6 floors) in an office building.  So even on the top floor, you are not going to get that 'fabulous city and lake view' that other hotels boast.  But the location is great.  It's a few blocks from State St. shopping and still only a few blocks from the south end of the Mag Mile.  Lots of restaurants within a block each way.  It was a 20 min walk from AMC River East.  I asked why they picked this hotel vs. the Inter-Continental which was a few dollars cheaper and I was told it was because of all the great reviews and the free cocktail hour(s) and continental breakfast every day!  Each floor has their own breakfast so you don't need to go into the lobby with someone watching over you as to how much you take.  There is coffee, juices, mini-bagels, muffins, bread, etc and the cocktails are served on the 6th floor and is taken advantage of by probably most, if not all guests.  The lobby isn't your usual hotel lobby, they have a piano (that actually was playing cd's), contemporary furniture, and 2 counter-top table like ""front desks"".  There is a fitness center that I did not use but no pool so not a big draw for families although there were kids staying there.  The rooms were good sized with nice furniture.  Our tv didn't have a good picture as everyone looked white.  The bathroom was pretty big with a some-what large counter top and a shower with double shower heads!  Either the tub was too small for the double shower heads or the drain was clogged b/c by the time I got out of the shower the water was up to my ankles and took a long time to go down.  You can even bring Fido with you as they take in dogs.",4
1045,Great stay in Chicago. Rooms ample size for the city. Great beds and modern decor.Location very good. Service very good. Weather was not great our weekend so we spent more time in hotel or close to hotel. Highly recommend.,4
1046,"We chose the Amalfi because of it's great  location, reasonable price and small size.   I  read the reviews of  other Yelpers and  after spending  the night there yesterday  here  is my take on this Boutique Hotel.   With the exception of the 2 front desk people , the staff is very friendly and helpful.  The style of the  lobby and common areas are  modern Italian meets Ikea .  The lobby is interesting, but I found  the two desks where you check in  an odd set up.   Our room, although small, was attractive, comfortable and clean.   I had read that some reviewers  found the rooms  run down.  This was not my experience.  The furnishings, wallpaper and linens looked very new.  The bathroom was quite large compared to the room itself.  It had a nice large vanity, make up stool, lighted make up mirror and a wonderful double headed shower.   The provided DVD's and CD's were lost on us, but the magazines and books were nice.     The hotel offers a free breakfast  of pastries and fruit on each floor. This is a nice touch and  very convenient especially  after a late night on the town.  They also offer a free evening  cocktail hour in a "" lounge"" on the 6th. floor.  We went upstairs to have our free drinks, but  found a long line of  people waiting to get inside.  We took a pass on the drinks. Would I stay here again?  Probably not.  Here's why... 1. The room was small and narrow.  It was ok for one night, but too small for more than that. 2. Noise.  Our room faced the alley and we heard garbage trucks , homeless people, hotel workers and people from the building next door all night long. 3. Age.  We are in our 40's and felt VERY old.  The average age seemed to be late 20's to early 30's. 4.VIEW....  The only view we had was that of the building across the alley.  I had read that  the views were bad, but bad is too nice for what you get.  I never thought I would care about views, but this was so awful that if we had planned on staying more than a day, I would have switched hotels.",3
1047,"This place is located in a great area. It was easy to hang out at some of the new places like Trump Tower & Hilton Rooftop among other places. I stayed here based on a group rate for a wedding. The things I enjoyed were the free happy hour from 5:30-7 daily. The staff is extremely friendly. The rooms were very clean except for a couple noticeable stains on the chair which were gross and moving the trash again back near my clothes when I kept moving it away. The things I did not like were thin walls, slamming and kicking of doors early in the morning for the complimentary breakfast rush. It felt like it was never ending. The only relaxing time was after everyone went on with their day. Definitely not a place to go when you are jet lagged and can't handle the time difference. Beside the problems with the doors, I had a problem with my shower knob. It would slide from cool to extremely burning hot. I told the front desk but the problem was never solved and I stayed for 5 nights. I don't know if I would go back. I even asked specifically for a quiet room. When asking for a late check out, they do charge an additional fee.",3
1048,"This place is exactly what I expected for paying 39.99 a night. From empty pool full of garbage, broken air conditioner, overflowing toilet, shower with little to no water pressure, shower changes from boiling to ice cube. I look forward to staying again next time I'm in Chicago. The crew that hangs outside did a great job pointing towards the nearest White Castle and kindly offered us a wide variety of drugs for sale. Who says people from Chicago are rude?",5
1049,"Was looking for a cheap place to stay near the Allstate Arena, total was around $50 for a night for a King bed room. I've stayed in a lot of hotels for around the same price, but this one really reflects the cheap price. Here's why: -Hallways and common areas are really in need of maintenance and basic care -Mold on the ceiling above the shower -Shower fluctuated between cold and scalding and the water pressure was pathetic -Mattress was extremely uncomfortable and had a distinct dent in the middle that we both rolled into over the night. -Breakfast was described as coffee and donuts, the coffee was terrible and the donuts were actually a platter of ho-ho's. -One of our lamps in the room didn't even work, room also needed more lights. -Wi-fi was available, but only in the lobby.",2
1050,"I would not stay at this hotel again. I can't believe that this place is still actually considered a hotel. The decor of the place is very similar to the decorations at the tower of terror at California Adventure in Disneyland. Only it looked more rugged. Random bleach stains on the carpet. The place was cheap but not worth the price. There was no water in the pool. The website does not even mention anything about the closing of the cafe that is supposedly on the site. All the amenities were older than old. The bed was more than uncomfortable. It was actually dipping in the middle. Pillows weren't fluffy. There is wifi only in the lobby. There are no places within the hotel to print boarding passes. On the upside, though, maid services were very thorough in keeping the hallways and the rooms clean. Fromt desk personnel were nice, too. And it was only minutes away from the airport.",1
1051,"I am sitting here with sweat dripping off me onto my glasses blurring my view of the screen in the sweltering lobby of the un-air-conditioned Chicago O'Hare Garden Hotel, perhaps the worst hotel I've ever been to and I used to stay at some GHETT-O places during high school for spring break in Panama City Beach, FL in the ""redneck riviera"" Back to the matter at hand.  The walls in the halls are all scratched up and dirty, half the light sconces are broken and the carpets are dirty and beat up.   Not an impressive property, but it sure is cheap.  I was also welcome to some big splotchy stains on my sheets, a toilet paper holder that was barely hanging on for life, and all but one of the lamps weren't even plugged in so I had to plug everything in. Well, I guess this place will make me appreciate every other place I stay at that much more :)",1

1053,You get what you pay for. Cheap price and cheap hotel. The building is falling into disrepair but the staff is nice and the beds comfortable.,2
1054,"The lobby is a bit scary, but the rooms are normal enough... Stayed here one night on the way to chicago and saved about 75% and I don't regret it one bit.. The fitness room is hilarious. It has a few cardio machines from the 80's and it appears that someone stole the tv",4
1055,I was only looking for a  cheap place to stay. That's what I got. I did not see any bugs. The place smelled clean and I constantly saw cleaning people. Staff were very friendly.

Wi-Fi only works in the lobby 12.  It took almost 30 mins to check, 15 mins from waiting, and about 10 mins to actually check in 13.  Questionable/odd tin man who is one of the cleaners... I guess the moral of the story is you get what you pay for.  I wouldn't recommend staying here unless you ABSOLUTELY have too and have no other choices.  There are NUMEROUS surrounding hotels, so I would book early and check those other hotels out first.",1

1060,"This place has a total racket going for students taking their medical licensing exams in Chicago.  They are even listed on the test site website.  Well for 80 bucks a night, I could've bought two rooms at a motel, and I would've got a better shower.  It started with a very strange shuttle ride.  Even though there were at least 2 vans in the lot with official logos, the van that came to get me had a makeshift sign that said ""Garden Inn"" instead of ""Garden Hotel"".  I had my suspicions when I walked down the hallways with green and gold peeling wallpaper.  The water pressure was terrible and every 2 minutes it would get really hot and scald me.  When someone in another room turned on their shower, it squealed at a horrible frequency in my room.  There is a reasonably priced restaurant, but the food is subpar.  I tried it twice.  The first time I had pasta carbonara with a sauce so runny it should've been called soup.  I tried again, this time with a salad so drenched in vinaigrette that I couldn't eat more than a few bites...so I filled up on bread, and it least it was yummy!  There is no place like home.",1
1061,"Pretty swanky. Slightly above average bed, bath, and beyond. I'd go back as long as I don't have to pay again.",4
1062,At this star level and price this place is lacking in a few areas: 1. Nickel and dime guests for receiving packages -- I mean come on - ??? 2. Claustrophobic gym 3. Lacking good restaurant -- the one sushi bar they have is limited 4. No pool Swissotel around the corner is better for this location and price point.,2
1063,"It was my first stay at the Fairmont Millennium Park and am so glad I discovered this place.  The hotel is in a beautiful part of the city, surrounded by lots of gorgeous scenery.  We had a great view from our room.  I can't imagine that there's a bad view from any room in the hotel.  The hotel is also in a quieter part of the city, which is nice when sleeping.  The staff there are wonderful too and very quick to take care of anything you need. The hotel is very close to Millennium Station and the CTA, which makes it really easy to get to.  There are also several restaurants nearby and a CVS right across the street. Our room was great and very spacious.  The bed and chairs were super comfy.  The closet was spacious as well.  The bathroom was huge with a separate shower, bath tub, and separate room for the toilet.  There was also vanity outside of the bathroom with a bench where I could do my hair and make up without taking up the bathroom. A nice touch was the Nespresso machine.  That coffee was so good! This hotel made our weekend in Chicago a wonderful one!",4
1064,"Great view from our room.  My in-laws had the spacious couple king size bed room which has a center view of the Buckingham Fountain.  We were next to them and I only see a partial view of the Fountain but still a great view.  Since there's so much to see in Chicago, we didn't even once turn on the television for our kids. I would ding this hotel for not restocking shower gel - we've stayed here for 4 nights and only do I get extra shower gel on the 3rd day when we ran out  and bumped into our housekeeper that morning.   For a Fairmont, I was surprised they didn't replenish.  I understand being ""green"" and good for the environment but we paid to stay and should have essentials restocked. Hotel is definitely in a nice location and close to the Navy Pier,  Millenium Park, riverboat cruises, and Wildberry Pancake House (a great place to get breakfast).  Overall the hotel looks and feels nice.  Noise level minimal since we were on the 18th floor.  Our car was brought up promptly so service was great there. With kids, a pool is necessary and this hotel does not offer it but we were able to get access through long corridors to the Swiss Hotel's indoor ""in the sky"" pool.  Just speak to the Fairmont concierge.  From this pool location, you could get a closer view of the Navy Pier.",4
1065,I stayed here and really loved the view of the city from my room! The room was very elegant and was very tasteful.   I enjoyed the huge bathroom with the separate shower and tub...They also had a separate area aside from the whole bathroom where i would do my makeup.The room was extra spacious and comfortable.  The only thing I didn't like is the housekeepers weren't up on game and didn't clean up or restock anything? What were they doing picking their damn nose in the hallway or what?,4
1066,"I stayed here for 5 nights last week for a conference and it was quite an enjoyable experience! The rooms are spacious, clean and tastefully designed. I loved the huge bathroom with both a shower and a tub. The food from room service was surprisingly excellent! I had the hummus plate one night and the lobster roll on another night. The conference rooms were also spacious and well equipped. The hotel catered our breakfast and lunch everyday and it was some of the best conference food I have had. There was a lot of variety for each meal, and there was dessert with lunch everyday! My one and only complaint is that my room was never restocked with the essentials. I had to call to have more coffee brought up. Also, the cups I used disappeared but new ones were not put in there place. A minor nuisance in the grand scheme of things, but it is those small details that make all the difference! Otherwise, I would LOVE to stay here again for business or for pleasure.",4
1067,"Loved the Fairmont - it was old time elegant and the staff so helpful. We had a corner suite and the room next door that could close off from the rest of the hallway and let the kids roam. Lake and Navy Pier view. So nice. The lobby is beautiful - round with a wine, cheese chocolate bar in the middle (three of my favorite things) In the morning it was a coffee, juice, pastry stop. How cool is that? And the restaurant? Check this out: http://www.yelp.com/biz/…  Normally I wouldn't seperate a restaurant from it's hotel with different reviewsbut this isn't ""ordinary"" Service was prompt every morning  (sometimes too prompt) Beds were comfy, turn down service with water left at every bed, nice bath products. Location is great - between Michican Avenue and Navy Pier, allowing us to keep the van in the garage with one exception. Be warned - Parking is expensive here. EXPENSIVE. (I think it was $60 a day) We spotted a small park from our window...perfect for the kids to play while we sat and watched. Waterspout fountains for them to run in. We were the only tourists...others were residents from nearby condos. It was a great find. Why only 4 stars? Besides the cost of parking after you're already forking it over for rooms, on arrival we pulled up at the lower level and asked if that was OK. They told us it was better because the front entrance is undergoing renovation. Then we waited in the heat with 5 kids for 25 minutes for a bellman. Not a good first impression. Also...no pool although they can send you to a nearby hotel's pool. Two hotel lobbies in my swimsuit...I don't think so. And you had to go thru a tunnel at the front entrance due to construction. Creepy. Construction won't last much longer, and I would definitely stay here again! Two thumbs up.",4
1068,"I would definitely stay at the Fairmont again, if only for their giant sparkly mural in the lobby! Alright so maybe not just because of that, but that thing is amazing. I wish I could have it in my apartment. The staff here is so nice, and wasn't overwhelmed when our group of over 40 people checked in all at the same time. Our rooms weren't ready yet, but they let a few of us change downstairs in the spa, and wow is that place beautiful! If you can fork up the extra cash, definitely spend some time down there. Or hey, if you're me, just go down there to change clothes and scope it out. Our corner room was really nice and a great size, and the same goes for the bathroom. The views can't be beat, either. We ordered room service a few times and everything was great! Expensive, but that comes with the territory. The only thing I didn't like was about an hour after your room service arrived, someone would knock on the door to take everything back. While that may seem convenient, it actually was a little annoying because the first time I was in the shower and the second time I was sleeping. The guy actually came in after knocking and picked everything up -- as I was sleeping. I thought I was dreaming but when I woke up the food was gone. Kind of creepy! This is a great, centrally-located Chicago hotel. The bar doesn't suck, either! Consider it while staying in the Chi.",4
1069,"The rooms were spacious, the tv was big, but that was all this place had to offer. There are no pools. The free wifi was questionable, and when taking a shower anyone that flushes the toilet throughout the hotel will affect your shower water. It's so odd that it's connected. I would prefer the Swiss next door. They are also currently remodeling the front.",3
1070,"I have stayed at this hotel for over 60 nights... The hotel is great and the rooms are very nice.. Although the motif is not quite my style... Looks sort of the 70s style with yellowish walls and wood furniture. The views are great, the service is spectacular. Last time I stayed here was in February of 2011",4
1071,"Beautiful hotel and great staff... pricey side of course, it's a Fairmont in Chicago, i expect nothing less.",4
1072,Great location and the rooms were very nice with cool views of the city. No free Internet and the gift shop was a bit pricey especially for water and snacks. Breakfast in the lounge was convenient but nothing special considering you have to pay for it.,4
1073,"I do so love Fairmont Hotels . . . Vancouver, Whistler, and, of course, San Francisco . . . so when coming to Chicago, we definitely stayed at the Fairmont Millennium Park. The lobby is beautifully appointed, with the check-in counter on one side of the circular lobby, the concierge on the other, and ENO (their lobby bar dedicated to wine, cheese and chocolate) dominating the middle. By the time we got our bags and the cab took us from O'Hare to the hotel, Lynn and I didn't check in until around 7:45-8:00, but our room was (naturally) waiting for us, and the bellman brought our bags up to the room immediately (good thing, too, as we had 8:30 dinner reservations). Our room was on the 15th floor, with a spectacular view to the east, of the yacht harbor and Lake Michigan.  The pillow-topped mattress was perfect; the bathroom large and roomy, the shower good, the Bose sound system paired with the flat-panel TV sounded great; so did the iPod player, actually, that was built into the base of the desk lamp, and the room came with free wi-fi.  The mini-bar wouldn't open, but we didn't need it (see below) except to store leftovers in, and they immediately brought up a small refrigerator to our room. The room was also on the opposite end of the floor from the Fairmont Gold Lounge, meaning breakfast, cocktails, and a concierge were mere steps (rather than floors) away . . . It was a SPECTACULAR place to stay. Gawd, I love the Fairmont . . .",5
1074,"Worst. Hotel. Experience. Ever. I've never written a review about a hotel (and this is the second ever 1-star review I've given) - that shows you how bad this experience must've been. I booked on kayak many weeks in advance. (I know booking through kayak doesn't result in quite the same service that booking through Fairmont and paying full price would have - however that is no excuse.) They: - double-booked our room - gave our non-smoking room to someone who came earlier in the day - only had one smoking room left in the entire hotel - would not give us any benefits in return (except breakfast - which we had already booked at a MUCH better place weeks in advance as well) - left stains, hairs, dead flies and dead mosquitos on our beds - AND the types of hairs that shall not be named in our tub - and then charged us an extra $70 (which they didn't tell us when we left, I had to find it on my credit card bill, and call them to have them remove the unwarranted charge) REVOLTING!!!! I could give many more details about how DISAPPOINTING and DISGUSTING we found the Fairmont Chicago - however intsead, I will simply advise you to CHOOSE SOMEPLACE ELSE!",1
1075,"I love Chicago! I cannot wait to go back and explore some more of this great city. I have to thank my job for sending me to Chicago this past May for an employee recognition trip. This was a great experience and i really happy i was able to share it with Meesh. We got there a day early to get the exploring started early. The Fairmont from day 1 impressed me. The service was top notch and the staff always had a smile on their faces. Always eager to help and make our stay more enjoyable. I felt like a little kid as we walked in the room. The bed was humungous and comfy as hell. Beautiful bathrooms and a sweet view plus they put us on the 20th floor so we could take advantage the view. We were there for a few days and soaked up the hotel and the city. Its located right in the middle by Millennium Park and everything is but a short cab ride away. Quick tip - walk around the block and check the Noodle place. Freaking delicious. We found it the last day there. Epic fail. if not, we would have been noodled out. Will i stay here again. If the price is right then yes. It can get a bit pricey but since my job was paying i was not worrying about the bill. Where to next ? travel buddy/girlfriend/adventurer Meesh Adventure is out there!",4
1076,"It's really hard to not like this hotel...  I was fortunate enough to have a  room facing the radisson and the lake.  simply fabulous.  the staff was attentive and friendly.  only downside was i was here for a work conference and the food wasn't too amazing... especially breakfast, it left me wanting so much more!",4
1077,"Overpriced, poor service. Generally when I go to a place that costs around $400 a night I expect to be treated well and it to be a memorable experience. When I got there the king size bed I reserved was not available so my girlfriend and I had to spend the weekend sharing a double. The concierge had attitude and offered nothing for our inconvenience. We go into the restaurant to get more attitude from the waitress, who forgot out drinks and made us feel unwelcome. I travel a lot, and often get better service in more stylish rooms for half the cost. I'll never stay in a fairmont again, I suggest anyone who has a choice do the same.",1
1078,"We stayed at Fairmont for 10 days due to a conference that was being held within the hotel. We checked in around 8pm the first night after a long delay of flight, but instead of checking in the room that we booked 6 months ago, we had to wait in the lobby for 30 mins for the room to be cleaned. The room was small and out-dated. We also had a small coffee table that's totally broken. The bathroom did not have the usual toiletries that you see at other 4-5 star hotels, q-tips/cotton balls etc, and the shower area had a strong moldy smell. The only good thing about it was that they had Miller Harris toiletries (which was not that great either.) No in-room coffee and no starbucks in the hotel. I had to walk to N Michigan Ave. for a cup of latte every morning. The location is great ONLY if you have a meeting right in the hotel, otherwise the area is very 9-5 and deserted after business hours. It's a long walk to any other tourist attractions or decent restaurants. I'd have chosen InterContinental if I've known the area better.",2
1079,"I went here for an annual work function because I'm a winner, and Fairmont in Chicago did NOT disappoint!  The entrance is beautiful, lush and modern.  The staff is friendly, not above-and-beyond greatness but ""good"".  There is a nice little wine bar in the middle of the entrance and it's a great place to park yourself and people watch.  My room was beautiful, clean and modern.  Had all the regular amenities with wifi and flatscreen tv.   There is a nice spa in the hotel where I got a Swedish massage by a nice Russian lady.  Kinda expensive, but that is pretty typical of a 4 star hotel.  They also had a nice women's area with a sitting area, steam room, showers and lockers. My favorite part was hanging out at the Sushi restaurant (don't remember the name) with the bartender who reminded me of Balki from Perfect Strangers.  I stopped to ask him if there were any cool lounges to hang out at nearby and he gave me a couple of tips but we ended up hanging out at the hotel anyway.  I had a glass of Riesling and he let me taste a few other new liquor items (Creme Yvette!! yum!) while we chatted.   All in all we had a great stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4
1080,"My stay at the Fairmont in April 2011 was nothing short of wonderful. I booked a King size room that had huge picture windows, a phenomenal bathroom, and a great dressing area. Room service was divine and I was grateful to be able to start my busy days with a healthy locally grown breakfast (smoothies and eggs among many other things). The bed was amazingly comfortable....the shower was heaven. I travel frequently to Chicago (at least 10 times a year) and I will be back again. I also just booked a trip to Bermuda and will be staying at the Fairmont there due to my excellent experience with their Chicago branch. The front desk staff were a little standoffish...I prefer more sucking up when I travel, but the room more than made up for it. The hotel bar had lovely ambiance but I found the drinks to be just so-so.",4
1081,"definitely kick ass location, lovely wine bar with a great menu, courteous/friendly staff.  Agree with other reviewers on the beds being awesome and the view from the 33rd floor was excellent.  Liked the bathroom with separate toilet/shower/bathtub areas and loved the extra-large bathtub and trademark bathrobe.  Only drawbacks:  Anthesthesiologists' convention in progress, and I wanted to have breakfast in bed on our last day, but the breakfast menu was severely limited.",4
1082,Parking is a challenge around here unless you know the area well or pay for valet.,4
1083,"I think I lucked out on this place. I got a room here via bidding on Priceline for like $80 for a Wednesday night in January. I had a great experience. Upon arrival the front desk lady was really friendly and was able to grant my wish of a room on a high floor (34th) looking out towards the lake. The view was amazing. The room was huge. The bathroom AREA was separate from the rest of the room. When I say area, there was a power area with its own mirror and bench, the actual bathroom which had a tub, a very nice stand alone marble shower, the sink area, and then the toilet had its own little closet within the actual bathroom. It was a little weird that there was no tank on the toilet and had a flushing system similar to what you would find in a stadium. This was really my only gripe. Besides that, everything was very nice. The TV was a 42"" flat screen. The bed was super soft with very nice pillows. There was a couch area with its own coffee table. There was a desk area as well. There was a nicely stocked mini bar, with about anything or any alcohol you could ever want. However, I'm sure everything in it was really expensive, i couldn't tell you for sure because there wasn't a price sheet, which was a bummer. If you need to use the Internet, be prepared to open your wallet cause it was $15 and some change per day for Internet. That too was a bummer. All in ll the place was great. I even used to concierge to book dinner at a top Italian restaurant before catching a show at Second City. This place was a great hotel and I would totally stay here again.",4
1084,"Great stay!! Me and my girls went to Chicago for the weekend, had a great stay at the Fairmont, it was affordable (on Orbitz), super friendly staff and the views were awesome. The prices were ridiculous though. 2 mimosas (not hard alcohol) were $35. Not gonna do that again!! But everything was great :)",4
1085,"Warning.  My stay here was compliments to my company a.k.a. I'm only writing this review on my stay and not making any judgments on price. I've stayed in Chicago before, near the Drake, and expected similar sized rooms.  In other words, small, like what you'd expect in New York.  When I walked into my room, I was pleasantly surprised.  If I was the one paying for this, I'd probably have my whole family staying in the room!  That.  Big.  Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating, but this certainly is a luxury hotel.  Walking in, I noticed the king sized bed and couch sitting more than six feet away from the bed. I then did the usual hotel ritual--looked through/at everything.  I ventured to the restroom and saw a standing shower (rain shower for the win!) and a separate tub.  The toilet was in its separate room as if this was a master suite bathroom.  There was also a vanity.  Nice! In the morning, I ordered room service--french toast with bruleed bananas.  While the service was really great (he ended coming back up to collect the tray without my calling) and helpful, I would say the bananas were a bit over bruleed.  But I guess that's just nitpicking. Although, if I was only rating this off of the environment of the room and room service itself, I would give it four stars.  Sadly, poor internet service and the area bumped it down.  First, the area: while not bad, there's really not that much to do around the hotel at night if you don't take a cab and don't know anything about Chicago.  Granted, that's just a qualm about living downtown, but still. Now poor internet service.  First, no free wi-fi in the lobby.  For some reason, I thought that was fairly common, but no.  $14 per day.  Though not bad, the service was SLOW.  I tried sending and receiving a few times from my work laptop and my iPhone (with AT&T's crappy service) got the messages and sent the messages even before they were received!  Muh. This was certainly a great stay for free, but would I return?  Mm maybe.  Then again..I live in Chicago.",3
1086,"This is a really nice hotel.. I don't have too much experience with straight up $$$$ hotels as I usually prefer just a place where I can sleep, change, and clean myself up. This was a sweet holiday gift from my bf's parents as it also allowed us to sleep in Chicago for two nights before heading out to Wisconsin for Christmas. The location of the Fairmont is very nice - just a short 20 minute walk out and you can get around to Navy Pier and lots of other cool locations. Walk out further 20-30 minutes and you can get your way to a sweet bar selling sweet microbrews. Yum. The rooms are really nice especially for a double bed. I can't imagine a room with larger beds or one singular king-sized bed, but I would think that it would be pretty nice! They have lots of dresser space to put your clothes in, really nice pillows and blankets, the beds definitely let your legs dangle in a child-like fashion if you wanted to, the windows don't open up a lot but they do for some air, the heater/ac works accordingly, and the bathroom.. YAY. I love clean bathrooms. And awesome baths. Really nice standing up showers. A little hide-a-seek toilet room. I also frequented the spa downstairs in the basement as well - it's really nice and it was empty, so I could walk around completely naked as I had wished. And I did.",4
1087,"The Fairmont is STILL fabulous.  My Marathon Man and I stayed this weekend, and the location was just perfect.  Less than a mile to the starting line.  The hotel was rather gracious about extending the checkout time by an hour and a half, so that runners could get their post-race shower. The bathroom is great...beds and pillows were just about perfect for me (husband's ribs were a little sore - I guess his sleep number score is a little higher than mine).  The office chair was inspired by the Eames aluminum group - handsome.  I especially like it that the rooms are spaced in groups of four, so hallway traffic is minimal. Even if you aren't in town for a race, it's a couple blocks from Millennium Park and scads of terrific sight-seeing.",4
1088,"Its ok. The good: Pretty lobby. Smells like fresh flowers. Great location. Big bathrooms. Great bath amenities. Friendly staff. NY Times delivered bright and early. The not so good: Small rooms. The lobby is very pretty, but the rooms are super boring. Thin walls. I could hear the alarm clock going off next door. The towels weren't very soft. Great place to watch drunk conventioneers.",3
1089,"I recently stayed at the Fairmont in Santa Monica so maybe I expected too much from this location, but at the Santa Monica location, my God, you're treated like a king.  It almost gets to the point of being a little embarrassing.  Similarly, this location positions themselves as a top tier ""luxury"" hotel.  Definitely not the case.   I'll start on the positives and work my way down: LOCATION: One of the best possible locations in the city, no question.  You're right in the heart of it all.     LOBBY: Great design of the lobby, very 'male'.  My wife suggested that they need some flowers to soften it up a little, of course I'm oblivious to a note like that, looked cool to me. The doormen were super friendly. ROOMS-LAYOUT: Very disappointed.  We walked in and were like, really?  This is IT?  Literally, it looked no better than a Holiday Inn, very small.  The furniture looked nice but it was form over function... literally, you get TWO drawers for clothes.  Hopefully you are traveling by yourself or your party packs SUPER lightly.   It's a little nit-picky, but why in the world is the TV lined up with the wall of the hallway (dividing the main room from the bathroom area) while the two-drawer seat is lined up with the end of the bed?  Maybe someone crashing in the hallway wants to watch some ESPN?   ROOMS-NOISE LEVEL: What in the world is up with the 120 decibel toilet?  I don't care that it looked like something you're see at a roadside gas station, but my Lord, when you flush it is insanely loud.  With our baby sleeping in the main room, we would try to not wake her; closing the outside bathroom door, closing the immediate bathroom door, and literally taking a robe, wrapping it around the closed toilet, hugging, then hitting the lever... and it would STILL jolt her awake.  I'm not even exaggerating. The doors close normally then - BANG!!  It just bangs shut, soooo loud.  You learn, after the first round of stink-eye you receive after you startle everyone awake, to ease the door closed... however, all night long, count on your neighbors' doors banging shut.  The walls were paper thin and it got annoying. SERVICE: This is were they really lost me.  Maybe it was just in our case but compared to the Santa Monica location, it really was like a 'get over it' attitude.   When we booked this two months prior, we were crystal clear that we needed a crib, which is standard (it was waiting for us in our Santa Monica room, even with toys!).  We called the week before as well as the day or so before to remind them about the crib, ""No problem.""  When we got there?  No cribs left.  Awesome.  I asked the worker at the desk, ""What should we do with our baby?""  ""I don't know what to tell you, Sir.""  I guess saying 'Sir' and 'Mr.' helps sugarcoat bad news. So the first night we had to sleep with our 11 month old in our bed, trying not to crush her during the night, trying to make sure she didn't quietly wake up and roll off the bed onto the hard floor.  This would have been a deal-breaker had we known they weren't going to come through on this.  On the second day, they finally got us one. CHARGES DON'T DRINK THE WATER!!!  They lock the mini-bar and you can only open it if you request the key, which we obviously didn't want.  At the Santa Monica location, however, they set out complementary bottled water.  ANY hotel puts tags on the water if they plan on charging you for this... not here!  The water's sitting right out there for the taking, no tags, no indication that they will be a charge, but get ready to pay $10.58 for two small waters when there is a CVS right across the street.  This is just flat out b.s., don't rip me off with something like this.  I called down, got a couple ""Sirs"" but they wouldn't take it off the bill. MISC: -There was a nail polish type of smell in the hallway every day. -$1 a page to print at the ""Business Center""!?  It's like $.05 at Kinkos (which is around the corner, thank God... my wife needed to print a 60 page script). -No free internet at this ""luxury"" hotel unless you're a member of the President's Club, which, fortunately, we were... sucks for other guests though.  Internet is standard these days, it's like paying for cable. OVERALL: I gave it two stars because one star would have been overly harsh, a one star is something like a Motel 6, but the rooms aren't that much better - no pool, bad service, constantly nickle and dimed.  What's the point of paying this price point?  A hotel with basically the same location and everything else is Hotel 71 (where my parents stayed) for about $100 a night, a fraction of the Fairmont.  I'd highly recommend that over this Fairmont. At the end of the day, would I come back?  NEVER.",2
1090,"I came here for a wedding reception and the hotel did a great job.  They had a room off of the main ballroom for a reception for the guest until the wedding party arrived, then we moved in the ballroom which was very elegant. The staff was great the food was decent.  I would highly recommend this place for a wedding and/or wedding reception.",5
1091,"I am sad to give this hotel only 2 stars because I was looking forward to staying here.  It was a complete disappointment. We stayed for the 2010 Chicago Marathon.  If running the marathon, do not make the Fairmont your first choice, regardless of how close it is to the starting/finish line & runner reunite stations. So many things went wrong with our visit and I would be reluctant to book with them again for the 2011 marathon. When we checked in, we were given a smoking room despite requesting a non-smoking room. The room reeked of smoke...as if someone just had a cigarette in the room right before we entered.  I was with my husband and children (3-years and a 15-months), and it was completely unacceptable to have them breathing this polluted air.  And I would be running 26.2 miles...it was beyond upsetting that I'd be breathing this air the night before the big run.  The one bed also seemed a bit 'off' like it was hastily made. We called the front desk to explain the situation and were told the hotel was fully booked and the best they could do was have maintenance clean the room again.  They could not commit to a time though, told us to go out for a few hours, and hopefully it would be in better shape when we got back.  Staff was not terribly rude, but they were certainly less than helpful or sympathetic to our issues. We proceeded to look for other accommodations rather than stay here.  While we were looking for hotels, my kids knocked over the wastebasket.  Lo and behold, they found a box of cigarettes, a bottle of beer, and a used condom (not in its wrapper) and the torn condom wrapper.  Thankfully the condom was stuck to the bottom of the wastebasket, so my kids didn't touch it.  We immediately called the Front Desk, let them know what we discovered, and within 5 minutes, they called us back and moved us to a nicer, non-smoking room. Obviously, the room was not cleaned before we arrived (or at least cleaned properly), and I assume someone may have even been in there moments before we arrived which could explain the strong cigarette smell that we encountered and mussed up bed. Again, I'm extremely disappointed to have to write a terrible review, because the Fairmont is in a wonderful location and seems to be as classy as the other reviewers note.  We often use the Fairmont in my company as well, and I've heard good things about them.  But obviously our experience does not say much for their cleanliness. I do give it two stars because I appreciate the staff getting us into another room quickly, though, I wish we didn't have to come across a used room and condom to get there.  Oh, and in-room dining was good, including the big bowl of pasta I had to prepare me for the marathon.",2
1092,"View from my room on the 31st floor: most of Chicago, plus Lake Michigan.  Hey, I could get used to this.  Too bad I was in the hotel room, and awake, for maybe 3 hours total.  Wait, actually, that's a good thing, but for other reasons. Huge room, separate shower and bath (and makeup vanity, but I didn't use that), nice LG flatscreen wall-mounted, very decent bed. Downsides: bad pillows (I HATE soft and squishy pillows); shower had one of those ceiling-mounted rainfall shower heads, which look awesome but don't function that well; there was a black extension cord just running along the floor to power a lamp.  None of these are big things, but they are enough to warrant 4 stars instead of 5.",4
1093,"Just spent a few days here at a work conference.  I have traveled A LOT for work and have spent plenty of nights in some pretty bad places and some pretty good ones.  Although as far as you know I am making that up.  I am not.  I disgress. Stayed two nights here this past week and was very impressed with everything about the hotel.  Not only is the staff very friendly but they addressed any issues that came up with my stay immediately.  Since I am sure you are curious the two issues were (1) my keys didn't work one night when I came back to the room (they ran two new keys up to my floor while I waited) and (2) I needed something out of my car which I had valet parked.  They also brought it up to my room within 10-15 minutes of my request.  Very impressed. Rooms were clean, modern and very spacious.  Excellent views of the city (from the 23rd floor).  The hotel has a nice spa in the lower level of the hotel.  In addition the hotel is connected to Chicgao's ""pedway"" which is an underground tunnel system connecting man of the buildings to one another.  Thus, I was able to get Starbucks in the morning without having to go outside. The only downside to this hotel was the conference rooms.  As I mentioned I was here for a work conference.  The rooms were cold as hell.  Hmmm...not such a great analogy come to think of it.  Needless to say many people were wearing jackets etc during the conference to stay warm.  It was ridiculous especially since it is April and wasn't warm outside. The only other caution I have for you dear reader is that valet parking is $51/night which even for Chicago seems steep.  I would recommend not parking here if you can find an overnight ramp cheaper.",4
1094,"This Fairmont certainly one-ups it here. Large clean rooms with actually tasteful decor. Marbled bathrooms with a huge shower n' bath. Plush robes. Miller Harris toiletries. NY times paper at your door. Free hotel valet during our stay and the most random phone near your toilet should need room service from there? Our package also included a $100 Saks card which was pure heaven for me aside from the fantastic hotel services. The valet service can be hit or miss some nights - having to track someone down can be a pill. The other amenities include (but we didn't use) a great spa that was open almost 24 hours daily. Pool n' work out room for $10 bucks all day pass. The hotel is also a little ways away from the shopping, so if you plan to hit the Mile then be prepared to do some walking. Overall no complaints, fantastic hotel and would stay again and again.",5
1095,"It was a nice hotel, great location, great gym that was connected and everyone there was very accommodating.  I can't say much for the rooms though.  The rooms weren't too big, it smelled, the beds seemed smaller than a full but bigger than a twin and the bathrooms in the lobby were better looking.   And it was weird how we had to take an escalator down a floor to take an elevator up to our rooms.  And the carts that held all the towels, toilet paper and everything else they used to clean each room stayed parked outside our room all weekend.  I mean it was convenient when we needed towels and all but just an eyesore.   The location is great though, there's a gym you can use for free if you join the presidential club on-line, small grocery store right around the corner, Millennium Park down the street and a short walk to Michigan where you can find almost anything you need.",4
1096,"Love this hotel. We had a great view from our hotel room. We can see Lake Michigan. Staff was awesome and very accommodating. It's downtown and walking distance to everything. Nice soft bed. It was a suite but given the really nice comfy, classy way of decorating the place I say I'll come back to this place again. Pretty pricey but then again-who cares?",5
1097,"A Definite Winner!  Stayed here for 2 nights (Friday and Saturday), and had a wonderful time.  The grand entrance is a small bar area with check in to the right and a dual restaurant bar area to the left.  A set of grand stairs directly faces you, you know you are at the right place.  The rooms are decently sized, the sheets are organic and bed was soft; I loved the small vanity area as well as dual shower and bathtub.  Let's not forget the adjustable flatscreen!  Loved it! The room resonates modern minimalism, clean lines, simple colors and plenty of compartments for all your needs.  This hotel is walking distance to the train and plenty of buses to get around the city.  Here are 2 small complaints: 1. Towels could use some downey 2. Restaurant/bar called Aria is below par and over-priced Nonetheless, I would recommend this hotel for anyone who's visiting the city for a weekend and looking for a great place to share in the moment.",4
1098,"3.5 stars -- This is a nicely renovated hotel located in a pretty accessible part of downtown Chicago. Good business hotel, and perfect for our Lollapalooza weekend due to its proximity to Grant Park. The service staff are all professional and friendly. Two points to note: 1. I partied all night on my last night there and went to sleep at 730am - asked for a 1030 wake up call. They called twice, and of course I didn't hear the phone.. and because I didn't pick up, they sent someone to knock on the door and wake us up. That's service. 2. My friend B dropped his wallet at the entrance when he left for the airport before us, and they immediately tracked back to which room he stayed in.. called us, and told us to let him know asap. Good thinking guys! The reason I'm only giving it 3.5 stars is because I noticed that the bathroom wasn't cleaned that impeccably for a place that costs $300 a night. The towels were replaced and all, but the floor wasn't swept and the T.P. was almost not replaced in time. So that was the only bad thing. OH.. and they don't have a swimming pool. That's kind of a bummer. Internet also costs $15 but that's generally how it is with fancier hotels. AND.. they forgot to replace the tea bags that we used. Oh well!",4
1099,"Pros: Staff was very pleasant.   Beds were comfortable. Cons: $10 per day per person to use the fitness center. The coffee shop in the lobby is absurdly expensive ($3.50 for a medium drip coffee, $5 for a scone) and the coffee isn't great.  I would have vastly preferred Starbucks. All around, not as nice as I expected for a Fairmont.",2
1100,"So here are the bad things that I encountered at the Fairmont Hotel since that is pretty much what everyone looks for first. -Must pay for the little things like internet and jacuzzi. -There is no swimming pool. This really sucked cause my view from the hotel looks into the Aqua Condominium's pool area, which looked refreshing. -Only has one trash can in the room.   -No dressers to put clothes away. -Small closet. On a side note...the cab drivers are the worst (except for one). I wonder if they live in their cab. The front seat of every single cab we took had junk in the front seat, like Dunkin Donut coffee cups or leftover wrappers from yesterday's dinner or lunch. Just take a peek in their front seat.   That's it!!! Everything else was delightful. There is a reason why you stay at the Fairmont and that's customer service (and the most comfy beds for vacation). From the valet to the concierge, everyone was very helpful and eager to please. This Fairmont Hotel seems a lot more hip that the other Fairmonts. Two blocks from Wacker, and four block from Magnificent Mile.",3
1101,"This is not so much for the hotel but for the ballroom on the second floor where we had a party, and then for the restaurant, Aria. For the party:  3 stars. We were welcomed into the hotel lobby, then swept up the stairs. All was fine until we walked into the ballroom... I've heard that there are a few beautiful ball rooms in this hotel, but this one was somewhat lacking. It transported me back to my days of bat and bar mitzvah's on the north shore of Long Island. Two big glitzy gold chandeliers, a small dance floor, mirrors on both sides of the walls, and... that's about it.  The ceilings were kind of low, too, and coupled with the dim lighting in this space, it felt kind of oppressive. Throw in  two severely understaffed free-standing bars (read: one bartender at each bar) with rude bartenders (probably overstressed, overworked, and underpaid), and you see why this event venue was a disappointment. For the restaurant: 2.5 stars. I'd read some good things about Aria, but having given it two shakes, I've decided I don't like it. For the price, you can easily find better food and a much more aesthetically pleasing environment. I will say, however, that they have a very delicious mushroom soup. I believe it's something like ""mushroom soup your mother never made."" I think my greatest qualms with the restaurant is the space. It's very long and narrow, making it awkward to maneuver around. Also, the restaurant is kind of divided into three separate sections - the front area for the bar, then a hostess booth hidden behind a wall, and then, as you keep walking, what appears to be another room. The layout is very awkward.",3
1102,"Stayed here on the night of July 4th even though I live in the South Loop.  The main reason was that I was being ""kicked"" out of my own apt because of a bachelorette party.   Got the Fairmont through PL as the ""luck of the draw."" Pictures: http://www.facebook.com/… Categorically: A) Star Rating: PL ranks Fairmont as a 4 star establishment.  I am not sure what qualifies them to be so, but I assume it has to do with the number of amenities that are in the actual complex, not by the shape of the amenities.  I thought that for a 3.5 star hotel, Embassy Suites in Lombard was much more well-maintained and spacious than Fairmont. B) Location: Fairly decent location in ""Millenium Park.""  Since it is located close to where I used to work, I had no problems navigating.  A word of caution: the physically address listed is 200 N. Columbus, but if you actually look up where 200 N. Columbus is, it's the lower part of the street.  The auto entrance is there, but the main pedestrian entrance is upstairs on S. Water St.   C) Public Spaces: I did not get to check all of these out, but these are the ones that I did see and go into, at least to look: the main Eno Bar area in the registration area, Aria restaurant, and Aria Bar.  The lighting in all these areas was fairly dim, to a fault I would say.  Even the escalators that went down from the main lobby level to the ballrooms and parking area weren't the brightest, but they were much better than the other.   I will post my review of Aria Bar where appropriate.  Also included at the complex were ballrooms, a spa, and business centers as well as meeting rooms. D) Room.  The room I got was a double bed on the 5th floor.  Not much to say about the view, but I didn't have high expectations about that.  Room came with: safe, ironing board, extra comforter, a little mirrored/vanity area, bathrobes, the usual English ""boutique"" toiletries, separate rain shower and tub, BMI scale (did not use this, ha), a phone in the toilet area, LCD TVs mounted very well on the wall, art mounted behind the headboard, couch, and working desk/table.  Walls were not very thick, and I could hear other guests walking about, as well as the people next door who were initially fighting when I got there.  Babies. E) Service.  Had 2 with the registration desk.  When I checked in, the person on duty seemed frazzled because of difficult clients right before me.  He checked me in quickly enough, but forgot to tell me where the elevators were.  He did mention the restaurants though.  Upon checking out, it was also quick, and the staff person was very friendly.  As mentioned before, I will include service at Aria Bar where appropriate. Overall, a very good experience.  A little pricey for what it was even with the PL bid, and some of the infrastructure seemed a little old (see my pictures).  Would stay again if I had to, but would prefer the Embassy Suites in proximity to this hotel.",4
1103,"I stayed here for four nights this fall for work. Hands down the best thing about my room were its size and the fact I could see the sun rising over Lake Michigan between the buildings every morning. The location was convenient, the king sized bed comfy, and all the finishes ultra plush. The bathroom featured a shower stall AND a tub. And the toilet was in its own closet. The TV was huge. one strange thing - i could hear EVERY time my neighbor showered or flushed the toilet. Very weird. And annoying. The lobby is ginourmous, with a small bar in the center with a nice selection of wines. I did like the revolving door that activated when you approached it. So yeah, the hotel is nice. But over the weekend, when I was footing the bill, I moved across the river to the Courtyard Marriott on E Hubbard street. The location was equally convenient, though we did have to walk 2 more blocks to Millenium Park. The rooms were smaller, the finishes less nice, but the service was superior. Everyone was so nice! The security guard got me ice when he was passing me in the hall and noticed the ice maker wasn't working for me. And they had a pool/jaccuzzi complimentary to guests, AND I didn't have to pay $14.95 for internet. BTW, the $14.95 for internet is for a 24 hour period that starts at midnight and goes until the next midnight. If you, for example, went out to a work dinner as soon as you got in and then wanted to check your email when you got back to the room at 11 PM, you'd pay $14.95 for the one hour until midnight, and then have to pay for it again at midnight. Apparently the internet is complimentary for gold club special people, which I was not one of. Either way, it was spotty, which is annoying especially if you're paying for it. Next time I visit Chicago, I'll probably stay elsewhere. Unless you're a rich person who doesn't mind being nickel and dimed, or you're here for work on a conference, I'd recommend you do the same.",2
1104,"I spent the fourth of July weekend here and I enjoyed my stay immensely.  The Fairmont is an ideal location for an out-of-town visitor.  It is on a very traffic street itself, but surprisingly central to everywhere you want to go.  I ate in Aria and enjoyed my dinner very much.  The staff were invariably friendly and competent.  I was upgraded to the Gold Level and enjoyed mytime in the Gold Lounge.  Christopher is a super nice guy and will do all he can to accommodate your request.  The room was clean and spacious.  The bathroom was just beautiful and there was a nice roomy closet.  I was very satisfied.  Join the President's Club and wifi is free with the room.",4
1105,"Clean room, and quiet, albeit much smaller than I expected. I kind of feel I got the overflow room. (Hilton Garden Inn has a room like this with more square footage, but not as large bathroom(The decor seems to have been stopped half way around the room. Two walls are conspicuously bare. Nice 38"" flat screen. Work desk is simple and nice with plugs and eithernet jack built into the top.The decor lamps hang awkwardly low. Bathrooms with separate tub, shower, vanity and toilet areas (almost nicer than the room!) The toilet looked like something out of a newly renovated truck stop. Dunno what that was all about, but hey, it flushed and worked. Staff is very thoughtful and prompt. Down side: room was unnecessary  drafty. Vent in the hall blows cold air. The doors aren't designed to really seal so a cold draft blows through the room. And it was 9f outside.. brrr...",3
1106,"This place disappointing for a high class hotel. Service is only marginal, staff is a little ridiculous and they nickle and dime you along the way. It's definitely nice decor, nice location but while i was trying to have a business phone call in the morning before i checked out, maid came by 4 times throughout the morning (as early as 8.30am) although the checkout is not until 12. I expect a lot more from a hotel of this class.. Also when i got there stuff like coffee, drink glasses and such was missing.. once again a high-class hotel like that does not have second chances when it comes to some of these basics. I would say go to W Lakeshore or Four Seasons if you want a nice place to stay.",3
1107,"The lobby is great, but the rooms on the 29th floor are cold !!!  They have a huge draft flowing into my room from the hallway...I tucked a blanket by the door to keep the room warm...",3
1108,"I stayed here in May og 09 because I got a free stay.  Yes, it was free.  My company is in the Aon Center (which is connected) and they gave all us administrative assistants a tour, lunch in the Aria restaurant and a free one night stay. Anyhow, I had a king room on the 29th floor with a park view.  The park view is high on my list of things that do not suck - I get no view at work since I don't have an exterior office.  The bed was awesome.  It was like sleeping on a puffy cloud on a warm sunshiney day in heaven. We also decided to splurge on room service.  I got a steak.  It was done the perfect shade of medium rare.  It was also crazy pricey.  $113 for my meal and my BFs meal.  However, when I called they were all ""How may I help you, Ms. Diggs""  Which I totally got a kick out of. Maybe they were being extra nice to me because of the nature of my visit and due to the fact that our companies have a deal, but they brought me up a complimentary Perrier and a fruit plate.  Not a fan of the Perrier, but the fruit was delish! I did buy some snacks and beverages at Bockwinkles (this was before the CVS was opened - it opened two weeks later) because I didn't want to pay for anything in the mini-bar, but I do expenses for a lot of travelers at my work and I knew those items would be vastly overpriced. The room was pretty big, the toilet had its own separate area from the shower and bath, and the food was good.  I have no complaints.  I'd stay there again if I came into some money or wanted to have a nice weekend with my BF on the town.",5
1109,"I was here for a wedding this past weekend, and it was one of the most beautiful weddings I've ever been to!  Part of this was because of the wedding planner of course (and the adorable couple), but this hotel really added to the experience.  The lobby is beautiful and the rooms were spacious.  The shower had upscale stone tile and a rain shower head.  The beds were very comfortable as well.  The valet people were so helpful with getting cabs and loading cars.  Another person in group called down for more space to put food, and a refrigerator was apparently brought up in minutes!  However, the drawer under the tv was sooo cheap and difficult to close!  This wasn't a big deal, but it didn't match the rest of the room.   The reception room was great, with a large dance floor big enough for a wedding of over 300!  The brunch the next morning was in a quaint and very pretty room.   We hung out in the Presidential Suite the day after the wedding (where the wedding couple was staying), and it was incredible (beautiful views, too).  The air conditioning was broken when we first went up there, but there were maintenance people in there fixing it right away.   This hotel is in a great location.  It was truly upscale and beautiful, and I highly suggest it.",5
1110,"Had a great stay at the Fairmont! Hotel was spotless. Reservations desk was friendly and very prompt. Room was clean, airy and bright with great views of a park and the lake. Towels were fresh, bed and pillows were plush. Bathroom had a wonderful rain shower. Walking distance to Millennium Park, Macys and all the other downtown spots.",4
1111,"I always wanted to go to the Fairmont San Jose but it's silly to rent a room for a night when I can sleep on my tiny futon at home a few blocks away. Luckily, I was able to experience the Fairmont Chicago. Here's the breakdown: + AMAZING bell boys. So funny and personable. I felt like a guest, not a tourist. They made me feel very comfortable and welcome. + AWESOME VIEW at the 22 floor. I was able to see the tall buildings and snow fall from a higher elevation. It was epic. + GORGEOUS interior design. We had two beds and the pretty flower artworks on the wall matched the color theme of the room. +WHOA, COMFY ASS BED. I wish I had this at home! The pillows were coshy and the comforter was like a million marshmallows hugging my body. +HD CHANNELS, NO WAY! Plenty of choices and in high def no doubt. Not too shabby. +UBER FAST elevators. I hate those slow crackity ones that smell like old fart. Plus these had clean mirrors to double check your morning hair do. + PRETTY SCENTED lotions and soaps. It wasn't floral or manly. It was a neutral smell that was fresh and sweet. I brought some home...;) - SLOW shower. I'm into the waterfall types of shower because they're pretty to look at but damn, it took me a while to wash the day away. A++++",5
1112,"I stayed here last year for the Chicago Gourmet festival in Millennium Park. Can't say enough about this place as far as service, location, and actual rooms.   I can't really speak to the amenities as I didn't do anything except eat, sleep, and walk while I was there. When I go back to Chicago, I'm staying here.  The price was just fine, I had a room with a view of the Lake, and the location was dead center in the heart of where you want to be.",4
1113,"The good: The hotel was exceptionally clean and nicely appointed, linens were very soft and comfortable, the mattresses were excellent quality too. The room was very large and spacious for the price. There were bathrobes and quality bath products as well as fresh, thick white cotton towels. It was easy to get internet. The housekeeping staff was very nice and did a great job. The doorman and bellhops were very courteous and helpful. The bad: The room service was very slow (est 1 hour for bkfst) although they did accommodate us and speed it up when I switched to uncooked menu items and said we had to get the food within 30 minutes. My main complaint is the hotel's featured restaurant on the first floor - Aria. The service was terrible, although the many waiters were sweet and good-natured they rarely came to our table and took forever to remove finished dishes. The food was mediocre, more confusion than fusion, and very expensive. We had 2 appetizers and split a main dish, 2 glasses of wine and one dessert. the bill was about $100 without the tip. For this price I expect superb food and service.",5
1114,"I have stayed here a number of times.  The rooms are very cool.  The restaurants/bars are more numerous than the nearby Swiss, but the in hotel restaurant Aria doesn't compare the the Swiss's powerhouse Palms.  The Aria Bar is a sushi bar that is more like a club for downtowners at night. The wine bar inside the Fairmont though is very nice and has a good selection.  Hopefully you know a lot about wine because the few times I've beent here the person working didn't and actually gave me information I knew was incorrect. There is another Eno bar down Michigan that is better in my opinion, but if you just want a drink or two before bed this is a good place to go.",4
1115,"Maybe 10 years ago this was the place to be, but not so much anymore.  There were a few highlights of my stay; the great personalities of their bellmen, a terrific waiter that took care of our table in the wine bar as girls came and went for spa services, and of course my girls that spent the weekend in town.  Outside of that, really nothing impressive.   The room was kind of standard and blah.  Our main bathroom door wouldn't close without throwing your weight into it, so thankfully our public bathroom looking toilet had it's own door.  The towels felt like my mom's, no fabric softener and line dried.  I at least got a decent exfoliation out of it that.  And really, over $15 for internet service.  I did get a great deal on the hotel rooms, so I'm not torn up about our stay.  I suppose I would have more to say if I had paid full price.",2
1116,"When you walk into the lobby on a cold blistery Chicago night, you're dazzled by the warmth of the lights and the contemporary feel of the bar & the restaurants on the first floor. Their rooms however seem a little cramped and for someone of slightly less than average height as I was not able to reach the cord to close the shades for privacy. Bad planning Fairmont. Yet again bad planning in the bathroom. The shower was a rain shower, which meant having to spend twice as long to rinse my hair and with no angle to the shower head, washing was not as easy as one would like. The bathroom is probably the biggest reason for the low marks. Everything in there seemed cramped and less than functional. While there for an event I experienced one of the ballrooms and the Moulin Rouge room. The ballroom needed some serious updating, everything just felt old and out of date. the catering was also mediocre. While in the Moulin Rouge room, there was an interesting layout with some great wallpaper, though the carpet horribly clashes and is distracting from some of the unique features of the room. Food there was much more interesting & satisfying. I've heard that Aria in the Fairmont is supposedly the best sushi in Chicago, though it's good & I loved that they were willing to make my favorite roll that was not on the menu, it is be no means the best I've ever had. The best thing about the Fairmont? The beds themselves. They were very comforting after a long day of traveling.",2
1117,"ooooh is this place classy.  i got a last-minute deal for new years night and i am thrilled that i took the plunge and stayed at the fairmont.  the room was enormous, the rain shower was decadent, and the in-room technology was mind-blowing.  oh yeah, and the price was incredible.  this would be the perfect hotel to stay at for Lolla or for the Taste of Chicago. i docked a star for my only two grips: the bed was too hard for my taste and the lobby needs way more comfortable places to lounge.  their weird mid-lobby bar is awkward and the seating is just a bunch of bar stools and a few small chairs.",4
1118,"Our room was absolutely beautiful and what you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Ok location, but if you plan on using the CTA to get around, it is a bit of walk to the transit station. The highlight for me was the bed/bedding...it was the most luxurious night's sleep I've ever had in a hotel room. BEWARE: Lots of hidden fees. Everything costs extra here (use of fitness center and pool, etc). P.S. The view was also pretty spectacular (and, yes that cost extra)",3
1119,"There really isn't any other word to describe the Fairmont Hotel other than classy!  It is such a fantastic hotel with a beautiful lobby and great rooms.  I've been to parties here and the ballrooms are wonderful and the guest rooms are very nice as well.  They also have Aria inside the hotel which is a bonus also!  If you are looking for a really nice hotel for out of towners, this is it!",4
1120,"I've actually never been in the Fairmont Hotel until I attended a wedding here last night. The wedding was beautiful and I was very impressed with the hotel.  It was an absolutely gorgeous ballroom that was elegant and simple so you can do a lot with it.  I haven't seen any of the guest rooms, but I""ve heard they are very nice as well.",4
1121,My wife and I tried one of their suites. It had a hot tub. The view was awesome. The price was reasonable. I give it five stars for value!,5
1122,"Great Hotel. 2 minute walk to Millenium Park, 4 minute walk to Michigan Avenue. Not sure how others are dishing the location? Rooms are very nice and BIG. Bathrooms are great. The restaurant downstairs, Aria, is excellent.  Service was perfect.  Highly Recommend.",4
1123,"This is a first-class hotel all the way. We stayed here and I got engaged to the fabulous Kate C. at the Fairmont Chicago. I'm just going to dock it one star for their false billing. They billed me for 5 drinks from the mini-bar and I didn't even have a key to it.When I called down to dispute it they were quick to apologize and ""we'll take it right off your bill."" Made me wonder if that's just standard operating procedure to sneak it by the unsuspecting few. I doubt it is but buyer beware. Anyway, outside of that everything was first-rate. We had drinks and delicious cheese at the lobby bar. They have a cheese flight to go along with an extensive wine list. It wasn't cheap, but, hey, it's the Fairmont. The rooms were spacious with full-HD tv's. Internet was extra but we didn't use it so, who cares. Oh yeah, no in-room coffee maker was also a negative. You'd think they could provide that if they're doling out robes and rain showers. The bathrooms, btw, were some of the best I've ever been in in a hotel. We will absolutely go back here...and they better not bill me for those drinks.",4
1124,"I really like the decor of this place.  The rooms are comfortable and a decent size compared to other hotels at this price I've stayed at in Chicago.  The view from my room was of Millennium Park, which looked really great at night.  There were a few problems.  We had paid extra for a package that included a late check out time of 5PM, when we got back at 4PM to get ready to leave we had been locked out of the room, and had to wait quite a while for them to get it fixed.  Also, the rain shower shower head thing, looks good, but not really functional.  I like water pressure.  Other than those complaints, it was an overall good experience and we would come back again.",4
1125,"My family was amazed with the rooms.  Clean, great views, super-nice people.  Valet - super.  Bed - amazing (my Uncle said I knows for sure they're going shopping for a new one).  Bathroom - great.  For two guests using canes and/or wheelchairs it was as easy as pie to navigate.  They felt like rock stars.  And the breakfast buffet was a nice surprise (we had one diebatic guest was in great shape before our day of fun). We've put other guests at the Swisshotel, I think the bathroom wasn't as easy to navigate, the bathtub was really high. Wi-fi wasn't important for us.",5
1126,"i may be getting a bit elitist but this fairmont wasn't all i expected. i originally booked here for one thing: the hd tv that was in every room in the newport beach fairmont. but alas, no LCD in this place. a nice overpriced minibar though. my room was pretty sweet - view of navy pier, king bed, decent sized bathroom with the porn star shower (the clear glass door, classy yet shady), and overall the room was a/a- (a great room). this is all probably because they thought i was my dad who is a fairmont god (thanks pops). so absolutely no complaints there. the lobby is very lacking, and the food is even more lacking, so i have to drop this to 3 stars (the tv hurt my feelings, what can i say).",3
1127,"This is an okay Fairmont,  however not my favorite.  The location is pretty good, close to  Michigan Ave. and walking distance to a lot of good bars/restaurants.  The concierge was very good and I used him daily (Tim, btw).  The rooms weren't that big and the bathroom didn't have a separate shower stall from bathtub.  The closet space was very minimal and the clothes drawers were almost non-existent.  The espresso machine was a nice touch, however I spent 5 days there and couldn't figure out how to  use it (probably says more about me than the machine).  The cleaning staff was good except for today when they knocked on the door at 8 am.  I probably wouldn't stay here again.  There are better options for a lower cost blocks away.",3
1128,"I have stayed in five different hotels in Chicago and this is my favorite.  I actually like the fact that it is a few blocks off Michigan Avenue.  It is still a really great location.  Our room was spacious and clean.  The lobby is beautiful and the girl at the front desk gave us free drinks and snacks in the lounge when our room wasn't ready for check-in.  We had a great stay, and I would love to stay at the Fairmont again.",4
1129,"Stayed here for a friend's wedding. The rooms were very nice and decent sized, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was excellent.

We actually got a pretty good rate here ($120/night) through Priceline, but standard room rates are typically more than double that. For OOT guests, parking can be rather pricey around these parts -- the Fairmont charges $50/day with in/out privileges -- so if you're not planning on moving your car, park in the Aon Building (directly across from the hotel parking), it's $13/day on weekends.",4
1132,"Beautifully appointed rooms and common areas.  However no 24hr room service.  WHAT?  Who does that in this day and age.  That's enough for me to never stay there again.  Besides, our room had terrible water pressure (tough for a girl with lots of hair) and hard-as-stone pillows.  Unacceptable.",2

1142,"Love this place! Spent my birthday weekend with my friends here. They gave us a really nice room on the 31st floor with a really rad view. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. The staff was outstanding. They gave us an empty mini fridge to store our drinks and food in for the weekend. The valet even told us a cheaper garage to park at for the weekend that was very close to the hotel. The bathroom was perfect for 4 girls to share it. Lots of mirrors, separate shower and bath and lots of lighting. Very close to Millennium Park which was great for the St. Patrick's Day parade. Great hotel!",5
1143,"The Fairmont is a very nice hotel.  The decor of the lobby gives it a romantic sexy vibe.  The only problem with the lobby is that the Eno wine bar is located smack dab in the middle of it.  Therefore the lobby area is actually pretty small.  Lovely, but small.  My sister ate at Aria and really enjoyed her meal.  She especially liked the ambiance.   The rooms are spacious and luxurious.  The large flat screen tv was a nice surprise.  The beds were comfortable and the decor was lovely.  The room featured a coffee pot which came in handy after walking around in the cold on Michigan Ave.  The rooms were plush.  I generally couldn't hear people in the rooms next to us except when they were blow drying their hair.  The bathrooms were quite large.  The separate shower and tub was a nice surprise.  The rain head shower was nice, but I found that it lacked good water pressure.  All of the fixtures in the bathroom were quite nice.   While the hotel was nice I'm not sure if I would stay here again.  I might try finding a hotel closer to Michigan Ave.  While this isn't far from Michigan Ave it isn't exactly as convenient some other hotels.",4

1147,"Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. The ""amenities"" were a smoke screen, nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn. I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. Being charged $15/day for Internet on top of a $250/night rate was a bit over the top. The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient. The shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head, unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost. The staff were friendly and helpful, actually the best part of the stay were the staff. All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room.",2

1149,Awful customer service. They charged us twice for the room and we had to go through hell and high-water to get our money back.,1
1150,"We stayed here for 3 evenings in December, and it was an amazing experience.  Our room was gorgeous, and the bathroom superior to any other hotel I've stayed in I think.  Our friends down the hall did find the layout of their room a little strange - the bed was more in the middle in front of a faux wall, and they didn't like that.  (but since this is my review and not theirs, I'm sticking with 5 stars).  We splurged and stayed on the gold floor - and so glad we did.  It was well worth the extra cost....I have stayed on other ""executive lounge"" or ""gold"" floors at other hotels, and I'd say this was the best to date.  The food is more than enough for breakfast so you don't need to eat elsewhere...and the snacks the rest of the day would tide us over until we went out for dinner.  The staff in the lounge were very helpful! We all got a massage one morning, and it was an excellent experience.  They could only fit 3 of us in, so they said they'd try to call some staff and see if they could call someone in, and they managed to squeeze the fourth one of us in!  That's service - considering we didn't try to book it until the night before, and it's the weekend before Christmas. Will definitely stay here again, next time in Chicago.",5
1151,"Stayed here for a 3-night stay for an annual conference. MAJOR problems with reservations.I booked a room 3 months in advance and was displaced to another hotel bc they ""overbooked""- I assume we were targeted bc our room was at military rates.  After a long flight & trudging through snow w/luggage I was NOT satisfied with this initial impression.  After many words were exchanged, we were shipped off to a sister hotel, brought back in the morning and rewarded with a suite on the 36th floor. Other than this initial migraine, staff was polite, facilities were beautiful, and conference was well-run.",3
1152,"Stayed here for a wedding and enjoyed a regular room with two doubles that was spacious enough that it felt like a suite.  Loved the views, loved the location (right off Millennium Park, walkable to the riverfront, shopping, and shops).  Great service (the front desk found us a pizza place that would deliver at 2am and they also helped us with an emergency wedding toast print out situation).  However, a few quibbles: 1) room service that ends at 10:30pm (not good for those of us arriving late at night from the west coast - hence the needed pizza delivery above), 2) no vending machines anywhere in the hotel,  meaning a bottle of water or a Sprite was nearly impossible to get late at night;  3) business center that closes before 6pm (hence the emergency printout situation above); 4) gym access by payment only - not complimentary for hotel guests; and 5) no in-room coffee maker.  While I appreciate the extra service they provide to make up for some of these amenities, I have travelled quite a lot for both business and pleasure, and I have come to expect the above amenities to be standard.  With this set of services, I imagine that they are targeting leisure travelers only, as this would not be acceptable for business travelers who stay on any frequent basis.",3
1153,"Overall, we had a great stay. We enjoyed the 24 hour room service, the large and beautiful room, and the nice views of Chi-town. Our experience with the staff was incredible!! they were on top of everything, especially ensuring we were having a great weekend!! The conceirge, Tim was amazing, hands-down. He  was what made our weekend incredible, by suggesting great places to visit, dine at, and truly went above and beyond to ensure our stay was top notch. The only thing that was disappointing was the noise of the doors of other hotel rooms. We were woken up both Sat and Sunday morning as early as 7am by other hotel room doors slamming closed. This was not fun, esp since we were hoping to sleep in late both mornings. Honestly, we heard every hotel door near our hotel bedroom slam closed. The insulation is horrible. And the noise level of the slamming doors was awful. We did note this to the concierge, who stated he received similar complaints from other hotel guests. So, if you're looking for a great hotel, amazing service, but the noise of slamming doors (due to poor insulation and bad architecture), this is the place.",4
1154,"I love the decor of this hotel. It is very edgy and attractive to look at. The wine bar has a great selection and the food there is great for a quick snack or dessert. The Aria Bar and Sushi is great for a snack and a drink before going out for a bit. I stayed there with my friend this weekend for her bachelorette party and the only thing I will say is at other hotels I have been to they give a discount or upgrade or a special treat for the guest. Our room was fantastic and classy, but the only issue I had was the beds are TOO soft, not comfortable when you have been drinking all night because your head sinks back towards the bottom while your feet feel raised up in the air. I woke up multiple times during the night because I was uncomfortable. The tvs are huge and the view was amazing from our room. Love the proximity to Millenium and Grant Park for the Taste of Chicago as well as the Art Museum. Only a 5 dollar cab ride to get to the busier parts of the city and the red line train is a 2 block walk.",4
1155,"Two words...FREE PARKING!  You can't beat that in the city.  The location is great - walking distance to some great restaurants and shopping.  Easy in / easy out.   On the down side, it's not the fanciest of rooms.  Clean and acceptable for the price.",4
1156,"This was a great place for our two-day stay in Chicago.  It was a good location, had free parking, a restaurant-style breakfast (instead of the typical continental fare), and a friendly staff.  There was one guy, Wallace Pope, who always had a big smile, and was extremely courteous and helpful.  I even wrote to the Best Western CEO about him.   It was not inexpensive ($375 for two nights, including taxes), but I think it was a reasonable price for downtown Chicago.",5
1157,"Older hotel, but price was right.",3
1158,Great for the price! Good location and free parking!!  If they had a fridge I might have given 5 stars! Nice staff!,4
1159,"Sufficed. Needed a quick, cheap, centrally located one-nighter and while customer service does vary among different staff members and departments, it works fine. Got there too late to try for any upgrade deal. My floor was a bit loud at times. And in the morning I was entertained by the alley I was facing. An open garage business with guys moving stuff in and out struck me as kind of funny. Enough for me to whip out my camera. I'd return under similar circumstances.",3
1160,"I stayed here for a nursing conference. Reservations were easy to get, the rate was great compared to the Grand Hyatt it was recommended we stay in, it was a 6 block walk from the Magnificent Mile, and free parking. Great, right? There's a billboard in the parking lot of the hotel. EVERY morning at 6am, work started on changing the billboard. Really? I could hear my neighbors talking in the bathroom, and the full conversation of the people upstairs. So quiet, not so much. Everything was clean, but smelled funny. Disinfectant funny. The bed was very comfortable. The facility had 3 elevators, and not all of them would get you to where you had to go. My car stayed underground and came out in 1 piece. No breakfast, but walking distance to lots of great places. The staff was great, very efficient. Until 5am when I got up to take a shower and had ice water. I called to the front desk and got a ""run it awhile, it should warm up"" after 10 minutes the water was still ice. In fact, after 14 hours, the water was still ice. I went to the front desk, and somehow it got fixed-well at least to the point I wasn't going to freeze in the shower. The knob was all the way to ""scalding"" and the water wouldn't pass to steep tea. The staff gave me suggestions for bus routes and passes, extended my checkout to 2pm, and worked with me on a payment issue for my stay, all of which was greatly appreciated. Would I stay here again? Unlikely.",2
1161,"My room was clean enough, but the hotel is old and dingy.  The consistent smell of air freshener in the hallways made me wonder what they were trying to cover up.   The staff were friendly enough, but not terribly helpful.  I must have been staying below a family of elephants as the noise from above was unbelievable.  Oh, and the bed in my room was about as soft as a pallet of cement blocks.   Who cares if the parking is free -- I say stay somewhere else.",2
1162,"Downtown, free parking, indoor pool, fitness center, and free WiFi....for less than $90 on Valentine's Day!  Looks like it doesn't get any better than that...right?  On paper this place looks great but it didn't rank very high IMHO...I would have given it 1 star but the free parking was worth a star. Checking in, I got the first glimpse of their customer service...or lack there of.  We got a standard king, it was a little smaller than I expected...but not so small that I felt claustrophobic.  The Internet access was a piece of cake to login to.  The noise on the street wasn't too obnoxious from the third floor.  However, the elevators were ridiculously slow...I was better off taking the stairs. The icing on the cake in our hotel experience...finding there was NO hot water in the morning!  My hubby had a big meeting early that day and was less than thrilled to discover this fact.  When I called the front desk, I was told maintenance wouldn't be available for another 2 hours.  Nothing like a cold shower to wake you up. While the hubby was at his meeting, I took full advantage of the fitness center.  It was pretty lame, only 4 pieces of equipment: treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike and multipurpose weight machine in a tiny little room.  Lucky for me I was the only one there and had the place to myself.  Not only was the fitness center small but it was HOT, there was no air circulation, venting, fan or window I could open.  It was a little hot box.  Plus, the water jug they had in there was empty. I checked back on the status of the hot water issue before heading back up to the room and the front desk said that maintenance didn't find anything wrong with the water and they were sorry for the misunderstanding.  I'm pretty sure the hubby didn't misunderstand that he had to take an ice bath of a shower earlier that morning. One star for free parking and one for free wifi & location...never going back, Chicago has a ton of other hotel's.",2
1163,"It's nothing fancy.  But it's a place to hang your hat while you're in Chicago.  It has free parking, which is huge for out-of-town guests ... especially in this neighborhood (VERY touristy).  The rooms are pretty small, but I've found that for my unassuming family, they don't need The Drake or The Peninsula to make them feel good about themselves.  They'd rather spend the money they save & spend it on their darling daughter (hi ... that's me). Also, yeah, Pizzeria Ora is a heavenly alternative to the big ticket Chicago-style pizza places nearby & it's IN THE BUILDING.  No wait, equally as good 'za, & have I mentioned it's IN THE BUILDING?  Which, if anyone who has every survived a Chicago blizzard knows is HUGE.  Plus, I believe that when you stay there, you get free drink tickets to the bar.  Score!",3
1164,"Place is great I've stayed here a couple times now staff is always friendly and acomidating , price is very reasonable , rooms are very clean. I would deffinatly stay here again and recommend this place a+",5
1165,"I was very surprised that a hotel in such a good location offered free parking and free internet. By free, I mean there's no hidden charges! I stayed there in mid March and was very surprised at how well decorated the rooms were. My boyfriend and I decided to get the queen sized room (it was very spacey). The bathrooms were very clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries. The location was wonderful because it was right by the Magnificent Mile and State St. We walked to everything without a problem, even late at night. There's a McDonalds right across the street, next to the Rainforest Cafe. I highly recommend booking the rooms online. Checking in took me literally less than a minute. I just had to show him my ID and picked up my room keys. Checking out was also a breeze because I had prepaid for the room online. All I had to do was return the room keys. We will definitely stay there again!",4
1166,"This place was reasonably price, close to transportation and walking to Navy pier, and very clean.  It is older and could be updated and we were disappointed that our room didn't have a fridge or microwave because we were there for 4 days and had leftovers each day we couldn't keep. The room was small and basic. The staff was friendly, especially Wallace the concierge.  It doesn't have any sort of continental breakfast which is a shame when all you want is just a little bit of cereal and you have to pay 4 bucks for it in the restaurant.  The bar/restaurant did have strong cheap drinks though. :) Lots of little restaurants/pubs nearby too.  We also reserved a room with a king bed but it was definitely a queen bed.  Very clean and quiet overall.  Free Wifi which is important.",3
1167,"very clean, kind staff and free parking! Spent a nice night here and was able to enjoy the best of Chicago! Good deal.  The rooms were kinda small but I'll take the trade off with the free parking",4
1168,"i'm giving best western river north four stars. not because it's the best hotel on the planet, but because it is the best value. two words:  free parking! which is extremely important in chicago if you've brought a car. it is not fancy or exciting at all.   it won't wow you. but it is down to earth, in a central location for tourist activities, did i mention free parking? the prices are unbeatable... roughly a hundred bucks any night. it's the place you want to stay if you aren't going to be in your hotel very much and don't want to spend much.   also, no creepies here [at least not that i'm aware of!]  meaning no creepies lurking in the elevator and no creepy bugs. it's definitely old, but it's a nice bang for your buck if you're not looking for anything special. i'll be staying there again next time i visit the city.",4
1169,"This place is DISMAL! The rooms are cheaply decorated with yellow paint, plywood and junky light fixtures. While I did not see any bugs or murders during my stay, my instincts told me that both were definitely possible here.",1
1170,"Great deal.  We got the ""internet only"" deal and then used a coupon for a $10 upgrade to a suite. All this is on their own web site. The suite coupon was ""subject to availability""  but we got one without trouble. One king bed and one couch bed.  The suite was  very comfortable and clean.  Fridge, two TVs, lots of chairs to relax in.  Looked brand new, no marks on wall, etc. Staff are very helpful with tourist tips. Right across the street from Hard Rock Cafe and Rain Forest Cafe but room is quiet.  EASY walk to the Magnificent  Mile and the amazing stores (check Bloomingdales for the stain glass windows). No breakfast or any restaurants in the hotel, they do have a bar. Free broadband Internet. Essentially a basic , clean place  . A suite in a downtown area with FREE parking for $100 a night (plus 23% tax) !!!",5
1171,"The Best Western River North is basically the only hotel with free parking in downtown Chicago, which makes it very popular with visitors and conventioneers. The exterior does have a motel-look, but the hotel is decent enough, good but not great. The rooms are average in size, and the sink is separate from the toilet and tub in the bathroom. The hotel has an excellent location as you are surrounded by restaurants, shops, galleries and other fun tourist attractions. Pizzeria Ora is a decent place if you do not want to wander too far from your room (try the taco pizza).",4
1172,"I'd say by far, this is one of the hotels I actually consider staying in because of its free parking and super friendly and helpful staff.  Like another person said... this isn't 5 star or anywhere close to it, BUT... it is a place that gives you the opportunity to rest your head and body after a long day of walking around downtown Chicago.  Who really NEEDS all the glitzy 5 star stuff when you'll be out all day long and evening and/or night in downtown?  Waste of money to have to have a hotel room with 1000 thread count sheets, mint on pillows, terry cloth bathrobes, et cetera... if you ask me.  Save your money on things that are longer lasting... Anyhow... had a good stay here when I went to see Madonna perform at United Center :)  Will definitely stay again :)",4
1173,"This is definitely not a 5-star hotel, more like a 2.5 to 3 star, but don't let that keep you from choosing this hotel. This is our first choice hotel every time we visit Chicago. This hotel ALWAYS has great rates and FREE parking and it's in PRIME location, a few block walk to the Magnificant Mile and next to dozens of great dining and nightlife! It doesn't get much better than that. My husband and I don't spend a lot of time at the hotel when we go to Chicago for the weekend, so I don't need luxury. But for the price, this hotel is better than expected!! The staff is super friendly!  The hotel is clean.  The beds are decent. BIG THANKS TO THE HOUSEKEEPING MANAGER KRISTY!!!!!!!!!! Our last stay was this past weekend and I left my favorite (expensive) pillow there. She called me within 2 hours of us checking out to tell me. They set it aside and a friend picked it up for me. I have never had a hotel ""find"" anything I've ever left there and I was so impressed with the honestly and prompt attention this hotel gave to my lost item. The rooms are a bit noisy, but it's Chicago....what do you expect. If you turn the fan on on the window unit, it drowns out all the traffic noise and any noise from the hallway. They have a GREAT swimming pool also! I have nothing bad to say about this hotel. For the price, I cannot complain about ANYTHING!!!",4
1174,I couldn't say it any better than Erin C.  What I would add is the Wi-Fi is intermittent; whether it is the hotel's fault or the enironment I could'nt say.  The attached restaurant serves as their bar and is nice and has good deep dish.  Drinks and beer are very reasonable.  We will stay here next time for both free parking and location.,3
1175,"Excellent location, great prices, and free parking! There are bars, subway trains, and everything important near you. Fitness center is a little weak but indoor pool and outdoor deck with great views is fantastic. The valets are very cool and take good care of the cars. Check this place out for a cheap and clean hotel.",4
1176,"Location is centrally located making it easy to walk to most places. Staff was incredibly helpful and nice. For the price and the FREE parking I am very happy with our stay. We had a king deluxe room which was very clean and spacious. It was nice having the mini fridge, living area, and two tvs. There are two negatives for me. The bed was very hard (I checked to make sure it was actually a mattress. Also even with the air on full blast it was quite hot at times (outside temps were high 50s to low 60s). The concierge was very helpful, front desk was courteous, parking attendants were so friendly. This is one of the best staffs I have encountered!",4
1177,"When staying in Chicago with friends for Michigan Ave fun, this is my hotel of choice. It is not fancy, but it is clean. It is affordable and parking is free. This is great when you would rather spend your money on a great meal, show or food. We had 3 adults comfortably in our room and cant beat $100 split 3 ways for a night",4
1178,Def not a top notch hotel...it was clean and did the job for someone coming to shop and sightsee...it was good when all you really did was sleep in the room...if you are looking for a nice hotel with a lot of amenitites this is not the hotel for you!,3
1179,"Great affordable and nice hotel! Relatively close to Chinatown as well! I've stayed here twice and have had pleasant experiences. My family pricelined this place to get an awesome cheap deal! What we mainly liked is its close proximity to Chinatown which is what we usually visit in Chicago. It has its defects, but I would say the pros heavily outweigh them. PROS: - Great location and close to Chinatown - Clean! - Lobby is beautiful and decorative - Great customer service (I requested extra towels and was nicely granted them) - Nice and personable parking/valet staff - Affordable on Priceline! - Clean and spacious restrooms - Swimming pool - Parking garage is easily accessible - This is little, but they have free Aquafresh toothpaste in the bathrooms! (my favorite brand) - Some rooms have a GREAT view of the Chicago Downtown Skyline CONS: - Parking price - A little lower quality for a 4-star hotel - No fridges in hotel rooms - No continental breakfast - Rooms could be more vibrant - Some rooms have bad views of just concrete - Some bathrooms have no vent/fan",4
1180,"Stayed at the hotel for an anniversary weekend staycation with my fiance. The room was nice and clean with a comfy bed and your usual hotel ammenities. The view was atrocious (a lovely construction site), so we just kept the curtains closed. We mainly stayed at this hotel because of the pool and their multiple restaurant options. Unfortunately during our stay the pool was freezing cold, there were only 4 total chairs available on the sun deck that were all occupied, and Shor was the only restaurant open during our stay (the food and service were more than subpar). We did get a really nice package deal, the romance package that included a bottle of sparkling wine, a chocolate fondue, and breakfast for 2 the next morning with late checkout. While the items included in the package were great, we had to specifically request all of it. If we did not alert the front desk of this, we never would have received any of it. I don't understand the point of having preferance selections when you book online if no one is actually going to pay attention to them. Overall, would I stay at this hotel again for a staycation? No, probably not unless there was some sort of great deal. Would I visit the restaurant again? Hell to the no. Would I recommend this hotel- sure, but only if you're here for a convention at McCormick place.",3
1181,"My husband stayed here for a little birthday get-away from our apartment.  Got a steal on Priceline.  I guess I was just not that impressed. Pros: Beautiful modern lobby, extremely comfortable beds (I slept SO well and woke with no aches), and immaculately clean rooms.  New carpet and linens.  Extremely friendly service at the front desk, and check-in was a breeze. In addition to the standard bar of soap, shampoo and conditioner, they give you a travel size toothpaste.  Gotta take pleasure in the little things, right? :) Cons: Expensive parking - but if you're like me and not willing to pay $35+ per night, you can find free street parking a few blocks away, on the west side of McCormick place.  For a 4-star hotel, the room decor was pretty lackluster, the furnishings were updated, but not such that I felt like I was in a 4-star hotel.  No bathrobes, no showercap, no bath mat, no tea bags, no fridge, no complimentary high speed internet.  Poor TV channel selections, and though we're pretty tech-savvy, it was impossible to figure out how to order a movie (although the girl at the desk mentioned we could do that and charge it to the room).  When we checked in, I asked the girl at the front desk if we could get a room with a view of the city, and she did manage to get us up pretty high (17th floor) but on the south side of the building, so all we had was a view of McCormick place and a little bit of lake, really.  My husband and I noticed on our way out that most rooms on the north side probably don't have a good city view anymore, because there is a new building being constructed right next to this one blocking the skyline. Overall, the Hyatt Regency just doesn't seem to be my flavor of hotel.  I'm sure it's perfect for the business traveler attending a convention at McCormick, but I wouldn't dare pay retail price for it and I probably won't recommend it to my friends if they were visiting Chicago.   Hint: Get good at Priceline's 'name your own price'... I got this hotel at 70% off!",3
1182,"On Sept 4, I made a reservation for 2 nights at the Hyatt McCormick Place in Chicago. I usually stay at The Wit (a Hilton hotel that always provides excellent service) when I am in Chicago on business. However, the rate was very high, so I decided to stay at the Hyatt since I had a conference at the McCormick Place anyway and the rate was about $100 less per night. I ended up not needing both nights, so I cancelled the second night more than 24 hours in advance in compliance with the cancellation policy. In fact, I was assured I would not be penalized. They did not put the bill under my door. So, as I was reviewing my e-mails today, I discovered that Hyatt cancelled and did not charge me for the 2nd night. However, to my surprise, Hyatt charged $464.85 to my American Express card. Yes, a small portion of that was for parking and taxes. But you increased my rate for the first night pretty significantly! The original reservation was $259 per night. The rep said when I cancelled one night, Hyatt had to charge me the going rate for that day. I was not informed of that rate change when I cancelled the 2nd night. The customer service rep (whose name I should have gotten but I hung up because I was so mad) was incredibly rude, telling me ""It is what it is."" Since I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member, I decided to try my luck with that department. At least that rep was more professional, but she still said there was nothing she could do. I have stayed in hotels hundreds of times, and there have been occasions when I've had to shorten my stay and cancelled a night. Never was I charged more for the nights I kept! I talked to our fiscal office, and they never heard of such a thing either. I could understand if I cancelled both nights and booked an entirely different date, but the rate should not have increased for the original night I booked. Sticking with the Hilton chain from now on.",1
1183,"I stayed here last week for a work conference and unfortunately I returned home to find BED BUG bites on my feet, arm and few other parts of body. Very irritating and not what one would suspect from a Hyatt. Called to relate this to a manager. I guess I was given the the manager of housekeeping that told me this would be looked into. 3 days later he called back to tell me the room was cleaned and inspected and had no BED BUGS. Right. I guess I imagined this horrendous rash/bites that I had right after staying at this hotel.  Poor location. Drab and old-very plain. Only useful for a conference at this site. What kind of a customer service person at a hotel denies that you had a problem or bad experience and offers nothing but a weak apology and denial that it was their fault. Go to any other hotel. I have never had this problem nor this kind of follow up from any hotel I have ever stayed.",2
1184,"The darn room keys barely work! You can insert/extract them slowly, medium speed, fast, ultra-fast and it's hit-or-miss on getting it to unlock the door. Same problem with both my card-keys, other folks were having the same problem which led to a lot of knocking noises at all hours. People would keep trying to get into their rooms or they would knock if someone was already in the room so they wouldn't have to use the key. The a/c is a bit touchy and makes the room either ice cold or super toasty, you have to keep adjusting it as the temperature isn't constant. Rooms are a bit dark and needs more lighting, the closet is in the shadows with no light. The bedside clock/radio has both an iPod/iPhone dock and a USB port which is very handy to recharge things. Only one outlet on the desk lamp so you'll have to crawl under the desk to plug-in something else or you can plug something on the other side of the room. The WiFi is free but has a 200MB data cap for a single device, if you want unlimited data it's an extra charge. This is the standard Hyatt data plan, also if you go for the premium data package ($15 extra/day) make sure you do it over WiFi so you can use up to 3 devices for that package. If you use the ethernet jack you will be limited to that specific jacked-in device. The hotel is a bit in the middle of nowhere if you want to puchase things like food or other things. There are 4 places to eat in the hotel with the cafe being the most convenient option selling cold deli sandwiches, chips, drinks, beer, Chicago dogs, etc. I didn't eat at the restaurants. Little coffeemaker in the room with complimentary coffee/tea and housekeeping staff is very good about keeping it well stocked if you use supplies. Front desk staff is friendly, bellmen and other staff members are all friendly and helpful so they do have a good crew from what I experienced. Bathroom was fine, the bath mat towel on one day was frayed and torn with a faded nasty looking stain on it. Complimentary toothpaste is nice, the glasses for water are ridiculously fancy and on the small side so if you use them to pour a drink on ice you'll be refilling it a lot. Had a conference at the exhibit hall which is across the street from the hotel (there are a couple of enclosed bridges connecting the hotel to the exhibition hall for use during bad weather, just walk at street level in nice weather as it's faster). For the amount of money paid the value isn't really there. The exhibition hall venue was a bit disappointing and though it's not the hotel I thought I should mention it: No soap in bathroom dispensers, late coffee service for our workshops everyday, freezing cold venue, slow food service catered through the hotel (they kept running out of food, didn't have enough tables/chairs). The good part about the venue is it's fairly easy to find an outlet to charge laptops, free WiFi.",2
1185,"It was convenient for an overnight stay to attend a concert at Soldier Field. It was kind of busy and hectic in the lobby. We asked for food options and were given possibly the worst hand-drawn, then copied map ever. It was only slightly correct. When asked about walking back to the hotel from Soldier Field, we were told to follow the lake, which was about as abstract as you can get and ended up with us going way out of our way and needing quite a bit of help from others to find our way back. But the room was clean and the bed didn't suck. It's pricey because they assume everyone staying there is on a corporate expense account.",2
1186,"This wasn't the smoothest of hotel experiences I've had.  It wasn't terrible, but I probably wouldn't stay here again. PROs: + The lobby looked very nice and up-scale.  They've obviously put a lot of work into making their front-end look nice.  It's too bad the rooms didn't match. + The room was fairly large, reasonably clean, and well-stocked (full-size hair dryer, toothpaste, make-up removing cloth, etc). + The bed/bedding was pretty comfortable. + Service was reasonably nice. + I didn't get to use it, but the fitness center was nice, free, and pretty large for a hotel. CONs: - The price for parking was ridiculous.  It was something like $42 a day for valet or $36 for self-park.  I know it's Chicago, but really??  I got a good deal on Priceline, but that's almost as much as I paid for the room!  Am I buying a separate hotel room for the car? - The room looked old and worn.  Considering how nice the lobby was, I wasn't expecting the room to be that rough.  The three-quarter wall between the bathroom and the bedroom was kind of weird; the three-quarter-wall retro-fitted closet with a curtain instead of a door was weirder.  Was the room really not built with a closet, and was the the best you could do?  The carpet had seen better days long ago, the shower/tub was lookin' rough, etc.  Old, old, old. - I had hoped for a decent city skyline view.  Unfortunately it was a view of nothing but the active highrise construction site directly next to the hotel.  Shades closed, methinks. - Okay, this is a stupid little thing, but the vending machines sucked.  I just wanted water and was scared to venture out at night in search of a convenience store.  I went to vending machines on three different floors with no luck before I went to the lobby to ask if any of them had water.  The lady at the front desk told me to try the machines in the laundry room.  That one had water, but wouldn't give me my change.  I found out the next day that my colleague used the vending machine on his floor to get a diet cola, only to have it spit out grape soda, which wasn't even listed on the machine! - There's a charge for WiFi in the rooms. - Worst smelling toiletries ever.  I don't know why all of the Hyatts use that crap other than that it must be cheap.  Have the decision-makers ever actually opened a bottle and taken a whiff?  That's supposed to be ginger?  *gag* I've certainly stayed in worse places and this doesn't deserve a one-star rating, but the pretty lobby didn't make up for what the hotel was lacking overall.  I would not stay here again.",2
1187,"It's in the middle of nowhere and the in house restaurants Shor and Forno close at like 5 PM and serve barely edible, over priced food like the $15 personal pizza that's not quite as good as a pizza hut pizza but double the price. On top of that it took nearly and hour and another 15 minutes to run my credit card. Over priced everything including the room because it's a convention center hotel. The room itself was average at best, definitely not worth the price. The staff aren't great either. The front desk staff are rude. The restaurant staff are inept. If you're visiting Chicago and your company isn't putting you up here, don't stay here. You can do a lot better for your money closer to downtown for you'll pay here and you'll get better quality and much better service. The only upside - Toothpaste. Yep, toothpaste. They give you a small personal sized toothpaste in your room so you don't have to ask for it or buy it if you forgot your own.",2
1188,"Location, location, location.  Obviously if you are in Chicago for a conference at McCormick, then staying at this Hyatt is very convenient.  However, getting around town can be a nightmare.  Taxi lines were often 20 minutes or more, and there is almost nothing nearby that is worth going to.   The Shor bar and restaurant meets relatively low expectations.  The drinks are decent, and the food is uninspiring, but edible.   Finally, the rooms are staid and cold.  They have zero character, as if the decor was an afterthought to the location.  I have slept in nicer rooms at 2 star hotels.",2
1189,1.  Room insanely cold. 2.  Rude front desk phone service 3.  Wake up call happened late and then repeated twice with other staff making the call (lack of coordination) 4. No place to charge phone or computer 5.  Television on dresser beside bed instead of in front of bed. 6. You have to pay for internet The only upside: 1. Pretty quick cab ride to MDW in the early AM 2. They actually give you toothpaste in your room (you don't have to ask or buy).,2
1190,"I came to this hotel to meet my fiancé upon his return from service.  Our first night together since he had come back home.  Complete disappointment for his return home.  We were given 2 double beds. They didn't explain this and when we made it to our rooms and discovered this and asked for a switch they said no that they were booked to capacity, didn't even offer a chance to upgrade to a suite.    I have worked in the industry for a bit and no hotel is ever booked to capacity without a major even happening in the city.  No one was helpful at all with anything, housekeeping or front staff.  The only redeeming quality is the parking attendant.   The lobby was ok.  But the rooms were dated and the beds were not comfortable.   For a few bucks more I could have stayed at a better hotel in a better location.  When I say better I meant the HOJO or Red Roof.  This says it has four stars but there is no way that it does.",2
1191,"So, the over all experience here was good except for ONE glaring point.  Hotels should do a couple of things right.  1. Have clean linens and bedding  and 2. have room service that is on time.  That said the Hyatt had a nice gym and pool.  Decent equipment.  It was conveniently located close the convention center that we were working at.  On our last day we called the night before for room service so that we would be sure to be able to eat before working since we had an early call time.  Well they called 15 mins after the time they were suppose to deliver our breakfast telling us it would be another 15-20 mins and if that would be OK.  WE SO ANNOYED BECUASE NOW HAD NO TIME TO EAT AND FIND ANOTHER OPTION.  They had all night to figure out their scheduling to be sure to have our breakfast served on time.   Sorry Hyatt this was totally unacceptable and worse you left us high an dry with out having breakfast and going straight to work where eating lunch is not option due to how busy the day is.  Hopefully next time you get it right and in the event of screwing it up you offer something in return for your mistake.",2
1192,"I pricelined this hotel and was very pleased. Yes it's off the beaten path but waking up with the entire Chicago skyline each morning made up for it. Cabs to the loop were about $7-9 before tip and always easy to get one. The room was clean, the staff were nice. About a 10 minute walk to Soldiers Field and the lake. For a weekend away, this hotel definitely works. I was in Chicago to see the city not the inside of a hotel room.",4
1193,"I have never been so disappointed in a hotel before until I stayed here. First of all I was staying here for the Chicago 1/2 marathon this past August. I stayed here last year and didn't have this many problems until this stay. First of all, they let you check in early online which is nice and then print out this barcode that you can scan at their kiosk near the front counter to get your room keys.  When I got there NONE of the 4 kiosks were working.  When I went to stand in the LONG line (which is why I checked in online to avoid this) the front desk attendant told me that i should check all the kiosks. I said NONE of them are working, shouldn't you know this?  They didn't have a clue what was going on. Second, right near the breakfast/starbucks area to get coffee smelled of BO! It was horrendous. It smelled like that last year and it was worse this time. How can they NOT do something about that. It was just disgusting. You felt like you wanted to throw up Thirdly, at around 4am we heard drunk guys outside our hallway screaming obscenities at either other for about a half hour. It woke us all up and we were trying to get a good night sleep for our race the next day.   Finally, you have to pay for parking, which we get. BUT it was a hassle leaving b/c they were so congested and the scanner thing wasn't working on the way out so we had to wait for assistance. I received  a survey from the Hyatt asking how my stay was. Well I filled it out and let them know I wasn't happy with things and will not be staying there ever again due to all the issues we had. Guess what? I NEVER heard back from their management. Disappointed that they do not care to better their services and keep customers coming back. I will NOT be staying there again!",2
1194,I have been living here for two weeks. I get fresh towels and sheets everyday... Without asking. The room is always cleaned daily and smells fresh. I hope to stay here again. The down side is the trip downtown. I wish there was more around the hotel to do.,4
1195,"It was by far the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I was there for two nights and house keeping never came in my room.....sleeping on dirty sheets and looking at old room service is the worst, so bad I made it my profile pic! Seriously the worst 4 star hotel period oh yeah for the inconvenience they offered me free coffee",1
1196,"I worked on a startup in Chicago in 2010. I have stayed in this hotel for 115 nights since then..so there's little I haven't seen here - good or bad. One time, I hadn't slept in three days and was looking down at my phone while walking, so I even saw the ladies room. It smelled like roses. As someone who travels a lot, the single most important thing to me is service. You get used to the TSA, you can live with bad food, but the last thing you want is someone pissing you off or not meeting your expectations. This Hyatt consistently went above and beyond and earned every one of their five stars. What's good? Very nice building/rooms, amazing view, incredibly friendly staff, easy taxi access, nice gym, and pretty good food. What could use work? The prices are tough - room service is overpriced, and if you aren't a Diamond member, wifi could get expensive. Also, although it's extremely close to downtown, it's not quite walkable, and there isn't much directly surrounding the hotel. Staying there as much as I did, it was like being at home. 99% of the time everything was perfect (I even got scotch and cake on my birthday). What mattered more, though, was that when things weren't right, like a messed up reservation or loud neighbors, they were taken care of immediately. The Hyatt O'Hare is a slightly more modern hotel (less convention-y) but I stay here whenever I can. I saw the staff do extraordinary things for people time and time again, so I know this wasn't all because I stayed there so much. I'm actually coming back in August with some friends just to visit. I highly recommend the hotel and still hope that one day, I will marry one of the girls from the front desk in the Forno Italian Trattoria.",5
1197,Very nice hotel. Was clean and kept up well. I had a room on the 26th floor with an excellent view. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere however so be prepared to take taxis anywhere else in the city.,4
1198,"After walking 1.5miles from the Adler Planetarium to get to the Hyatt the Staff was super friendly even though I looked sweaty and gross with my giant back pack I was lugging around. Everything I would expect from a 4star hotel pool-check sun tanning balcony-check fitness center-check 4different places to eat within the hotel- check King size bed and extra clean +roomy room all a major check. Reason why not 5 stars its a little further away from downtown but the CTA runs right outside the hotel which makes it easy to commute, and no free wifi Come on 10dollars a day?! its 2011 starbucks and coffee shops give free wifi If I'm staying at a 4star hotel I would expect that to be free too but oh well. I would come back when I'm back in town.",4
1199,"I stayed here for four nights back in mid-June and had a pleasant experience. The hotel was clean and all of the staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful. That being said, I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I was actually attending an event at the adjacent convention center. It's out of the way of downtown and, although the Chinatown L stop is only a few short blocks away, it's doesn't seem like a safe walk after dark or for a female walking solo (like me!). I did like that I was upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival and that they had a boarding pass printing station in the lobby. The free WiFi was hit or miss; you literally had to be a few feet from the lobby to get a good signal. Not a major issue for me, but if you're traveling on business it might be good to know. There is WiFi that you can pay to have in your room for around $10-$15 per day. Next time I'll be sure to stay at a more central location to downtown attractions.",3
1200,"Was in town for the night and needed place to crash, got a great deal through priceline.  For the price i paid, the hotel was outstanding, and i really liked the self-checkin kiosks.   The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a bit out of the way, which is probably nice if you are doing something at McCormick Pl. I was using public transit and the 21 bus was spotty, it also doesnt run until 6am on Sundays, so if you have an early flight you're taking a cab.   A courtesy shuttle to/from the Cermak red-line stop would be a GREAT addition and give alot of added value to this hotel.",4
1201,"I should preface this review that this hotel is very far from all of the touristy things in Chicago.  While it's not too far from the museum campus, you'll have to cab it, especailly with little ones. The room was very large, bed was SUPER comfy, and had a great view of the lake and Soldiers Field (how cool!!)  Everything was spotless, and service was spot on.",4
1202,"If you're attending a conference at the convention center, the Hyatt Regency is tough to beat. It's connected to the center by a hallway and has big screen TVs in the lobby which list convention locations (as well as weather and metro routes into the city). While a very busy lobby, the staff moved people through at a reasonable pace with a concierge and valets who kept taxis in a respectful line back from the door before whistling them to advance. The rooms are also nice with comfortable beds, ready access cords for computers, flat screen TV as well as smaller touches (not only did they have the complimentary shampoo and conditioner, but they had toothpaste in the room). There's two drawbacks to the Hyatt. The first is the location. It can't be entirely helped since it's part of the convention center complex, but it's a decent distance from the downtown and tourist sites. It's a walkable distance, but plan on a brisk 30 minute walk before you start to get to areas that are interesting. The second drawback is that apparently the walls are thin. Noises in the hallway seem magnified and you can even hear the squeak of doorhandles turning in the hallway. Conversations in the adjacent rooms are easy to hear (sadly, the conversations in the rooms next to me were fairly mundane); don't discuss something that you don't want to see on a blog 15 minutes later here.",4
1203,"No, you're not really close to the center of town. Not within walking distance anyway. So if you know that going into it, then you won't be disappointed. The cab ride into the city is short though. The check in line was long but it moved quickly. I wasn't happy to see that the self check in kiosk wasn't working. Those are relatively new! They should work! But whatever, the front desk guy was fast and really helpful so human interaction was actually preferred in this situation. Our suite was GORGEOUS and everything was perfect. They have great amenities and a HUGE lounge with a little shop for coffee, snacks, reading materials...ect. The valet and bell hop guys are very nice...plenty of room to handle many cars. The cab line downstairs at the peak of ""going out"" time was sort of long but it moved quickly. I was surprised because there isn't much aroudn there, but the cabs seem to frequent it at the right time.",5
1204,"Above average hotel stay for the following reasons. -Down comforter -nice toiletries (wish they were more eco-friendly though) -pool, and sauna -cushy bed down sides -cable tv channel selection. Wtf!!!? NO MTV. -far away from everthing in chicago besides the mccormick place convention center.",4
1205,"Very nice lobby and lounge area amenities. Rooms are in good shape but overall are not that great - I hate that there is not a real closet but rather a rack with a curtain in front of it. While it is attached to the convention center it is still a hike. Also, the SHOR restaurant, Forno quick food and M/X bar are all good. I was especially pleased with the pannini at Forno. The best thing about this place? I dropped my Tiffany bracelet down the drain at 2am and the plumber came right away and looked for close to an hour for it - he found it and I appreciate him trying so hard...",3
1206,"4.5 stars..... We stayed in a suite at this hotel, and it was one helluva room.  I loved it.  Views cover 2 of the 4 walls in the suites, and the bed feels like a cloud dropped out of heaven.  What more can you ask for? However - - it loses the 1/2 star solely because it's out in the middle of nowhere.  Unless you have reason to be near the Convention Center, which is conveniently located right next to the hotel (attached, actually) then there really is no reason to be at Hyatt McCormick.  (This is the reason we were at this location to begin with, obviously.) To get to ""downtown"" or the more happening areas of Chicago, it will generally be a $10+ cabride there, and then again, on the way back.  After a week there, this can accumulate to quite a sum.    The only plus side to this is that you get to drive up and down Michigan Ave during all times of the day/night, and see what's happening.  This would be nice if you rented a car... but then driving home after a night out will STILL be quite a hike! Many things about the Hyatt McCormick indicate it IS indeed a hotel all about business, and even the staff seem accustomed to dealing with people traveling for business - not pleasure, in that they are rather curt, get the job done, and no small talk, no extra smile, or anything.  Their goal is to get people in, and out as efficiently as possible.  No complaints, but you can tell you're not in California anymore.  :-) Bathrooms were nice - shower was great.  Toiletries - very nice.   There is a general lack of outlets in the room. Television, for the size of the room, was small, but there were two tv's in our suite. There is also a bar area with fridge and cabinets with sink - - no stove though - and no microwave, so it's more for entertaining than preparing food or reheating food. Really beautiful room and breathtaking view.  I wish I had taken photos, but unfortunately, I forgot! If this hotel were located centrally within ""playing distance"", I'd give it a 5-star hands down, but solely for its location -  I can't give it the full 5-stars.  4.5 stars it is.",4
1207,"Close to convention center and driving distance to Chinatown. Decent, but overpriced food. Pros - comfortable and within walking distance to the convention center. Comfortable rooms. Nice work out gym/pool area. Equipped with TVs, water, headphones, towels and fitness magazines. Cons - No free internet access. Check in/ check out kiosk does not work. Often little to no ink to print out boarding passes at the kiosk. Business center is a disappointment.",3
1208,I had a decent stay here.  The hotel seemed relatively new and the views of downtown was amazing.  The restaurants off the lobby were all good I thought for hotel food.  The bed was super comfy.   Ride downtown was only $11 each way.  Not ideal but the nice rooms and comfy beds made up for it.,4
1209,"The Hyatt at McCormick Place was the second hotel that I stayed at during my recent visit to Chicago.  I was unsatisfied with my previous location and was in a rush to check into the Hyatt.  Although the regular check in time is at 3pm, I explained my situation to a front desk girl at 8am and she quickly found a great room for me.  I settled into my room shortly thereafter.   The corner room that I was given had all of the regular Hyatt Regency features like the cushy bed, pillows, textured wall treatments, stone bathroom floors, etc.  These features were on par with the  two previous stays that I've had across the country this past summer with HR so I can say that HR is of consistently decent quality.  The main difference that I found at this Hyatt was that there was no concierge present during the whole duration of my visit.  Rather, the guest services helped us out and were our de facto concierges.  Our concierges were helpful with recommendations because there are no nearby eateries unless you count the Connie's Pizza and McDonalds located deep in the belly of the McCormick Center.   Taking a cab is essential to get a good impression of the city no matter what hotel you use.  Although the HR has a free one way shuttle (leaves on the top of each hour), it only makes three stops: the museum campus, water tower and Navy pier.  All of these stops are great taxi pickup spots, you can get closer to your intended destinations. Thankfully I ended my stay in Chicago with the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place.  I've learned that I can depend on them for great amenities and customer service.  I'll look forward to staying at another one in the future.",4
1210,"One word: ""eh"".   Having stayed closer to the center of town, this place seemed really really really far away from everything.  Oh, did i mention it's like, really far away?? Ok, to be fair, they shuttle you into downtown, but ha!  guess what?  NO shuttle back!  [sucka!]   Negatives: The room was average, we had a two bed room.  I didn't like that the bathroom was open, (ie: no door to the sink area) b/c then that means if you get up earlier or in the middle of the night, the other person can hear you.   The deco was ok, very modern feel, but lacked since there wasn't a microwave.   Positives: Did like that the shower was separate, had decent toiletries.  The floors were updated with granite, but average counter tops. Next door to some sort of rail system but is not the ""el"" as Chicagoans call the subway. FIVE STAR aspect: GREAT GYM.  Really new and updated equipment.  Free water, towels and headsets.   hmm, i just basically said that ""if you are a work out fanatic and plan on staying indoors during your whole stay, then THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU my friend!""   Overall, i don't think i would stay here again unless i had to; and had an expense account for the taxi rides...",2
1211,"easy to get to, great landscaping, amazing conference rooms...this was the best manditory workshop ive ever been to, because this building and its staff were so great. at lunch time...after i copped an extra diet coke with lime and cup of ice...i scooted down to the concierge and asked him where i could find a mailbox. he pointed to somewhere on a nearby wall. i then asked some follow up questions to insure that the postmistress was really going to come and get me envelope. he assured me they would. but i wasnt convinced. so he took the envelope and tucked it in his breastpocket and then said he would hand deliver it to the postmistress for me. alls i know is....the bank got the check and i got to keep my condo. yessss!",5
1212,"Overall, my experience here was decent - the hotel room was pretty spacious and since it was comped - not too sure on the price of it.  It also has massive underground conference facilities that can cope well with 5,000 people. Yes, it is connected to an underground shopping mall so you don''t really need to leave the building at all. Unfortunately the whole complex is massively confusing and I got lost a handful of times. edit: I just attended a beautiful wedding ceremony and reception here - the catering was done really well and the entire setup of an ethnic wedding went very well.",4
1213,"I stayed in this hotel while attending a conference in McCormick Place West, and it was pretty nice.  The location was very convenient, so after working a full day on the exhibit room floor, I could escape to my room pretty easily, just by walking over the bridgeway. There isn't much around it to do though, so if you're looking for more to do in the evening than stay in and watch TV, you should try for something further north.  It is close to Chinatown, though you should drive there or take a cab.  There's a patch of a bad neighborhood between McCormick Place and there, so walking is not a good choice. But the room was nice (mine had a little bonus living room area), room service was excellent (better than a Westin I stayed at a few days later), and everyone there was welcoming and friendly.  There's an attached parking garage, with valet available, and you can easily get to downtown or down to 55 from there.",4
1214,Extremely disappointed. Restaurant closes at 11 am. and then nothing until 5 pm.  Bar doesn't open until 5 pm. Felt more like a motel than a hotel,2
1215,"Let me preface this by saying that we were in town to see U2 at Soldier's Field.  The show was our #1 priority so the hotel was really secondary to the whole experience.  This hotel was the closest we could find to Soldier and it was ""alright.""  Our room was comfortable and clean.  The fitness center is well-equipped and open 24 hours a day which is a really nice feature. The downside: For what you get, this hotel is overpriced.  It's a totally average business-minded hotel.  The lobby is great, but the rest is very very average.  It is not close to public transit, downtown, etc.  Also, the folks working at the front desk are unfriendly and borderline idiots.  They managed to: - eff up our reservation - charge us for our room twice* - waste a lot of our time - almost lose our bags Needless to say next time I am in a similar situation, I'll be staying at the W or the Park Hilton and cabbing.  Way better service and more bang for your buck.   *Also..... to the folks at the McCormick Hyatt: I am still waiting for those charges to come off my card.  You will be hearing from me again.",2
1216,"Modern hotel attached to the convention center, which is useful if you are at a convention.  But totally useless if you are not, or are trying to escape your convention.  Its so isolated that everything is overpriced.  There's no wireless access, and the wired internet is expensive.   Come here with an expense account or not at all.",2
1217,"Here is the update on this hotel after my stay this last weekend.  I can really tell they are working hard on their customer service skills...this time was alot better and if I was coming in without the bad experiences, I would probably rate at 4 stars.  The restaurant was open at the time we needed with a buffet that was affordable and kid friendly.  The front desk manager ( I think), Sarah was extremely welcoming and went above and beyond.  This was the biggest improvement of all and I believe the most important.  I still have the unresolved phone issue that is affecting my view but maybe by next year, I can get over that.  All in all, much better this time.  The location is still an inconvenience though.",3
1218,"Stayed for one night to qualify for a Gold Passport Promo. While it's out of the way(close to McCormick place but not much else), it's a very nice hotel. Restaurant was nice as well.",4
1219,"This place was fantastic. They gave us a great rate because we were with a very small convention being held at University of Chicago. Plus our room was very spacious and stylish, and we had an incredible view of the downtown skyline. They fix nice strong drinks in the bar downstairs, and the gym facilities were gorgeous. Yes it is a short hike to Millenium Park, etc. But they have a free shuttle for drop-offs, and I took the bus three times in two days and it was a breeze. Simple, straight shot-----you're on, you're off. The staff were also so sweet and helpful. We loved it here.",4
1220,"I travel to Chicago frequently for work (sometimes as often as once a month) and I always stay here. The staff is always friendly and I often get upgraded to nicer rooms. The location is prime because I hop on the public bus (stop is right in front of the hotel) and I am downtown in 10-15 minutes for a few bucks without having to pay for a cab. I have stayed here to attend a conference and it was well orchestrated with ample meeting space for the events. During non-conference trips I have enjoyed their great gym and sauna (seriously, quite nice) for some healthy relaxation. The gym is not huge but it is well equipped with everything you need (all top of the line). I haven't checked out the pool yet, but it seems serviceable. Some have complained about non-comfy beds, but mine have always been great. Once or twice I was stuck on a lower floor on the ""bad"" side of the tower, but usually I get a room with sweeping views of downtown Chicago or the lake. Regarding cleanliness -- I have yet to have a single bedbug scare and I have been staying here on and off for two years now. Most rooms are well kept, occasionally you get stuck in one with some old or uncared furniture but usually not. Soundproofing sometimes leaves a bit to be desired and depending on where you are you can hear hallway noise or noise from adjacent rooms, but it usually is nothing overwhelming and typical of what you would find at any hotel. Price-wise, I often get a good deal staying here (usually around $120-145 a night) which I think is great for a place with so many amenities and good service. Room service can be hit or miss, but I do make sure to always order breakfast as it's consistently delicious. You have to pay for internet which sucks but it's not too pricey. Once when I was there, I had a work emergency and needed to print and fax asap. I used their facilities on sight and got everything I needed in a timely way -- the downside was it was pricey -- I think it cost me $50+ to print maybe 10 pages and fax 10 pages. Staff is always courteous and attentive. Plus if you come at the right time you can pick up whatever cute business men are in town for the conference....the orthopedic surgeons tend to be the most fun!",4
1221,"I was doing some work for one of the conferences held at the McCormick Place.  The conference host booked me a room at the Hyatt and gave me a confirmation for a late check-in.  My flight was late and I finally made it to the hotel around 10:30 p.m. only to be told they had no rooms available.  I am like WTH?  They offered the guy in line in front of me the option of one or two rooms.  I was pissed and getting no where so I took them craptastic offer of a room at the closest hotel accepting overflow - A Red Roof Inn in Deerfield - a good 45 minute cab ride with no traffic.  That was a little piece of heck being sent to no less than 4 rooms before one was acceptable - one was dirty, one had no electricity, one was occupied by a man who threatened my life for breaking into his room...  Then in the early a.m. I had to take a 90 minute cab ride back to the McCormick Place. What Hyatt Did Right: - Offered to comp the Red Roof Inn room - Gave me $120 in cash for the cab ride - Offered me a guaranteed room the next night at a reduced rate plus all meals comped. - Upgraded my room to a corner suite - Sent me ""I am Sorry"" snacks and form letter like notes of apology from the G.M. and  catering manager. What Hyatt Did Wrong: - Sent me 1 1/2 hours out of my way to stay an an AWFUL hotel. - Gave me $10 too little to cover the cab fare back and forth - BILLED ME IN FULL FOR THE UPGRADE ROOM and FOR THE SNACKS!!!!! I was stupefied by offering all these nice things and then sending me the bill.  Really?!  Do you treat all guests this way???  I guess as a convention site they really don't have to provide quality customer service - they get people regardless.  When I travel, I generally like to stay at nicer hotels - Hyatt has recently been crossed off my list. In the end when I complained about the bill, they did offer an apology again and comp the entire bill.",2
1222,"I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel, unless you're attending a conference at McCormick Place. Negatives- 1. Far away from city. $12 cab ride/each-way. 2. Food in restaurants is horrible and super expensive. 3. Parking situation is crazy. They never explain to you the difference between Self park and Valet. 4. TV's are ancient. With 30 cable channels only. 5. No Wireless internet and its $9.99 a day. 6. Bed has no fitted sheet. They lay a flat sheet on mattress so by the end of the night, you're sleeping on the mattress. Gross! 7. Freezing- The hallways are kept at 50 degrees. and... NO ONE ELSE IS HERE I can't think of a pro, other then there is hot water?!?! Do Not Stay Here!",2
1223,"Very nice hotel.  Clean, attentive staff.  Located in south Chicago; not a lot very close by - 2 miles of walking gets old.  If I had a bus schedule, maybe I could speed this up.  Surrounding area seems 'abandoned'.  Excellent Fitness center - huge with cardio and weights.",4
1224,"We were extended a complementary stay due to our dissatisfaction with our last visit over Valentines Day. Elizabeth Finifrock in Guest Services went out of her way to make up for our previous disappointment.  We were given the LakeShore Suite on the 31st floor, with amazing views of the lake, the loop and Soldier Field.  The suite was HUGE and luxurious, eminently comfortable and homey.  I think I'm spoiled for all future hotel stays ;). Upon returning from a trip to Shedd, we arrived back in our room to find refreshments waiting for us.  Elizabeth had recommended a restaurant  that proved to be a great choice!  The night was made complete with a complimentary ""sweet tooth"" tray of truffles and cheesecake ""pops""! The whole night - our anniversary btw - was amazing and more than made up for our disastrous visit previously. While I hate to think it takes a negative for a hotel or other service to change its tune, I AM happy to know that the folks @ Hyatt take our feedback seriously.  We had a great time.",5
1225,"Stayed here for a conference being held at McCormick Place recently. The people were wonderful, the room was lovely, great view of Lake Michigan, and very convenient for the convention center. Check in was easy, but on the third day I checked my credit card and realized they made a mistake. They were charging me per night even though I had prepaid. I was worried it would be a hassle, but a quick trip to the front desk and they took care of it right away. There is a restaurant on the main level, an Italian carry-out type place and little ""coffee shop"" called the Daily Grind. The ""lounge"" advertised is not really all that. It is simply a more bar type extension of the restaurant. I did like that there were seating areas, with mini coffee tables all around the area of the restaurant and coffee shop on the main level. Also, free wi-fi not only in the rooms but throughout the hotel and the convention center. Made things much easier. Gym was awesome with another great lake Michigan view. Overall nice experience.",5
1226,"The hotel itself is fine (facilities, staff, etc.). However, unless you are attending a conference at the attached convention center (and do not plan on doing anything else in Chicago), do not stay here! THERE IS NOTHING AROUND THIS HOTEL! 1 star if you are not attending a conference.",2
1227,"Very nice hotel but I have major reservations in giving it anything higher than three stars. The hotel itself is four or five stars.  Great accommodations, clean, sharply designed.  We enjoyed our time there. As a hotel for tourists, though, it's lousy.  I was placed there via a great Priceline deal, but the hotel is in a sketchy area, which you discover if you walk to the nearest CTA stop, or to the Metra station, or just straight into town.  During the daytime, you'll notice said sketchiness but I was never fearful of anything happening.  The evening is a totally different story, and we began taking a cab home. If you're going for a convention at McCormick Place, or just passing through town, this is a fantastic hotel.  If you're a tourist, I wouldn't choose to stay here.  If you're a tourist going through a deal site and are blindly placed here, just be prepared to drive or spend a little of that saved money on cabs. Finally, some people here do make great points about how this place is often understaffed -- the employees are very helpful and friendly, but during the daytime can be hard to find or get a hold of.",3
1228,"Just what the hotel reviews said, a 4 Star quality hotel and they are correct. This place was perfect for a stay in Chicago. A bit further away from downtown but nothing the Train can't solve. The comfort of the room was amazing, very nice beds, room can go pitch black so you get no sunlight, and the cleanliness of the place is spectacular. I didn't notice all the shops they have down under till the next morning, but they do have a small store and a very relaxing lounge area with couches. I priceline'd this hotel so I got a great deal. I would love to stay at this hotel once again.",5
1229,"Wrost Experience ever!!  I travel nationwide a lot for business every year, and this Hyatt's service is really bad. Especially their Front desk and sercurity manager who work at night time that give you unbelievable attitude. They are tired so you do not even want to ask them a single question!!! : P OK, You can still try to book your room if you want, but make sure that you would not have any emergency situation happened at night. Good luck~!!",1
1230,"Unless you're paying with company $$, paying $30 for parking and $10 for Internet access really sucks...",2
1231,"Let's start with the good things about the Hyatt Regency McCormick: - very comfy bed - decent toiletries (soap, shampoo, etc) - All North facing rooms have a great view of the Chicago Skyline AND Lake Michigan to the right. - Connected to the HUGE McCormick Place and convention center What's so bad about staying there? - There is NOTHING around it.  It's a $15.00 cab ride to the loop.   - You're stuck paying a premium on parking, restaurants and even bottle water because there isn't a drug store around. It is close to the Midway Airport.  The Orange line cost $2 but once you get out on Roosevelt Ave, there isn't much cabs in that neighborhood, so you can walk 12-15 blocks or wait for a bus. I'm not thrilled to come back in July but that's where the convention I'm going to will be hosted. Edit 08/03/07: overcharges for everything.  Surcharge for the privilege for a package to be delivered to the Hyatt. $10/day for Hard Line (not even wireless) internet access at home and if you go downstairs to the lobby the wireless internet is $10/more a day. SHOR restaurant is overpriced bland food.",1
1232,"To echo everyone else - absolutely no reason to stay here if you're not attending an event at the convention center. - $45 cab ride to and from O'Hare.  Luckily on my way back I split it with anoter conference attendee - When I checked in, I threw my stuff down in the room and went to sit in the desk chair but it had been smeared with grape jelly.  Gross.  Thank god I noticed.  It almost felt like a prank, you know, like unscrewing the cap on a salt shaker. . . - Incredibly overpriced food at their restaurants.  A chicken and pasta in tomato sauce with a side salad was $37 through room service - ""Late"" checkout is 1:00 instead of noon.  Super helpful. - No newspaper at your door in the morning - You have to pay for internet - The pool is a joke - The entire hotel and convention center are kept at meat-locker temperatures.  I lost feeling in my extremeties several times. - Considering you're a prisoner to the hotel, you'd figure they'd offer more TV channels.  Nope.  There were like 10 channels, 4 of which were ESPN.  No Comedy Central, no MTV or VH1, no Toon Network, no Food Network. . . The only two redeeming points were that - - The fitness center was pretty nice, not the best I've had at a hotel but nice.  But the water cooler they have is WAAAAAY over-lemony, like sucking on a lemon.  Gross, especially coming off a hard workout. - We got continental breakfast in the mornings of the conference which was actually pretty good.  Fruits, cereals, parfaits, pastries.",2
1233,"Rooms were nice and fancy but they charged for every tiny thing.  We were charged $10 for wifi per device, not per room and this was not stated clearly in the instructions.  Really primitive to be using IP address detection instead of user id/password.  Parking was $30 which was reasonable.",2
1234,"This place is like the ritz carlton compared to its crappy concrete predecessor, the McCormick Inn. Parking is a sinch (though expensive) and the hotel easily connects to the convention center. If you're attending a conference at McCormick Place, the Hyatt is a great option.",4
1235,"This is a perfect hotel to go to if you're in town for business.   That's exactly what took me there...  I was attending a convention, right @ the McCormick Convention Center. Staying at this hotel was perfect.  No need for a cab or even walk outside, just down the elevator, walk a couple of hallways and there I was.   View from the suite was the beautiful Chicago skyline.  Everything is just a cab ride away (Michigan Ave. & Millennium Park were only 10 minutes away).   According to one of my coworkers, the hotel gym is awesome!   To eat (right at the hotel, other than room service), there's Forno, a small cafe, and there's also M/X restaurant & bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/…). Rooms are big, comfy big beds, my only complaint would be the super small fridge for a 2 bedroom suite.  We were obviously holding meetings there, we needed supplies (water, drinks, etc) to entertain our clients...  But we made it work.  Service was really good, but I do recommend you order room service with time, it takes about half an hour more than they say it will. They obviously have wireless service, shipping service, screens at their lobby with flight information, and computers to print boarding passes. Like I said, it's a great place to stay for business.",4
1236,"the best part of staying here is close to the McCormick Convention Center, no need to wait in Taxi or Shuttle line after the show.  Yet, NO 2nd Selection of RESTAURANT Is the down fall for this hotel.  After eating there everyday for breakfast, you will get sick of thinking going into their ONLY RESTAURANT.",3
1237,"Service is impeccable!  :-)  Here for the NRA convention - glad we pick this hotel.  Very convenient to McCormick Convention Center!  Staying for 3 more nights so maybe this is a ""premature"" review.  However, if I don't rate it now, I'll forget!  LOL.  Love the ""energy"" of the staff here!  Locked myself out of my bathroom though (ooops) -- apparently the way the handle of the lock hits the wall when you open it automatically ""locks"" you out, but the handy person came immediately and fixed the problem instantly.  This is a ""common"" problem, he said.  He even thank me for choosing Hyatt and ""keeping him employed"".  What a gem!  :-)",5
1238,"Hmm...what can I say about this hotel? What Impressed Me: -Beautiful building (it's pretty tall and elegantly modern inside) -The doorman/valet combo at the main entrance -Four-star treatment by the hotel staff -Plenty of parking -Room design -The double sinks What Didn't Impress Me: -Parking fees (I know it's 4-star, but come onnnn...) -The beds -The view from the room -The location -The jacked up sink So here's the deal. This is a pretty nice hotel--I wouldn't rave and brag about it being 4-star because when I laid my head down to sleep every night, I still felt like I was sleeping in a 3 (or maaaybe 3.5)-star hotel room. My boyfriend and I won 2 nights here through Priceline for a holiday, so we understood that we really weren't in any position to complain about much. However, there were a couple of things that we THOUGHT would be expected, considering that we were still at a supposedly fancy place. 1. The walls are INCREDIBLY thin. If you stayed in that hotel with us that weekend, we could tell you everything that you did. We knew when you went to the bathroom. We knew when you showered. We knew when you fought and cussed out your drunk girlfriend in your hotel room THREE doors down for 2 hours. And we knew that your devilish 5-year-old did NOT want to take a bath, go eat breakfast, or do anything else that you politely asked them to do. Thank GOD nobody around us got laid that weekend (although they probably didn't feel the same way lol) Minus half a star for you! 2. I appreciate the plethora of parking...especially since the hotel is in a major city. But when that doorman told us that daily parking was $33 and valet was $45, we almost had a heart attack. lol Guess that's how yall roll at these fancy schmancy hotels! We didn't complain or anything, but thirty dollars?! lol I guess that's more of a heads up for everyone.  No stars lost, but you get a warning. 3. O.M.G. You'd think that some of the money they're milking out of everyone would go towards the beds, considering that that's really what you're paying for. I know hotels aren't really using real boxsprings anymore, but the things that these mattresses were resting on were horrible! They made noises every time you sat on them.  And the mattresses were just outright uncomfortable. They were cheap, wherever they got them from. We actually spent the next 2 nights at a run-of-the-mill Marriott in Detroit, and their beds--amazing! Felt like I was in a 4-star bed...kinda how I THOUGHT I was going to feel when I slept here. This alone made me want to never stay at this hotel again. Yes, I understand you pay for the name when you stay at these kind of hotels, but I mean, a bed is a STANDARD luxury. If you're going to act like you're a luxury hotel, get a luxury bed! Or at least one that you can sleep in (not ON, in!) Great big fail on this front, guys. Minus one star. 4. I had a sink that took forever to process. lol It kind of annoyed me! You'd think this could be easily fixed with some Drain-o--why don't the housekeepers make note of this kind of stuff, anyway? Not a big deal, but it urked me. Good thing we had two sinks to work from. No points lost here. 5. All in all, it's a beautiful hotel. The decor inside is amazing, and the restaurants looked lovely (we chose to eat inside the city instead of splurging on hotel food). And you'd think with it being as tall as it is, the views would be better, but from our room, it really wasn't much. Maybe it's better from some of the other rooms. Doesn't help that it's not in the best part of Chicago--don't worry, you're not in the hood by any means, but you're definitely not in the thriving bustle of the city. I'll give half a star for trying, I guess. So there you have it! Four star on paper, three star in reality. Will I stay there again? Not if I have a choice! Would I recommend staying there? Only if you have to, or if you're like us, and happened to win it somehow. No need to run from it, but there's no need to run and tell your friends either. lol",3
1239,I had a great nights sleep here.  The bed was super comfy. I came in late and they were still able to accommodate me for room service. The food was yummy and the service was quick.  Even though I was only here for one night the staff was so accommodating that I wouldn't hesitate to return here for another trip.,4
1240,"Stayed two nights. Great hotel! The only problem is that there is no easy access from the chicago metro. You have to walk a long way. Its best to get here from taxi. If you are flying in to OHare or Midway, take the train to any downtown location (like Adams street) and then cab to this hotel for like 12 bucks. also, there is nothing much to do near this hotel in walking distance...except the convention center is attached.  The room service food was excellent. they were able to make me a delicious vegetarian meal almost at midnight (when i checked in). Paid almost 180$ per night. I had awesome views from my room!!",4
1241,Very nice beds and a good bar. The bartender was very kind a courteous. I've stayed at many hotels that charge more than they deliver but his is a great hotel. You get what you pay for and this is a great bang for the buck.,4
1242,"Stayed here for a conference. Facilities were fine. Had a good trip, coming in from internationally but was rather jet lagged.",4
1243,"stayed for a conference.  hotel was decent, got a nice room on the top floor with an amazing view of the city and lake.  that was a nice perk.  however, this place is just way too big.  it takes forever to get anywhere.   they have a concierge service counter, but twice there was no person there!  that was a little annoying.   this is a good place to stay if you are trying to avoid traffic such as the chicago marathon.  close to downtown, but still has open access and open roads.",4
1244,"This hotel is the only property physically connected to McCormick Place, which makes it popular for exhibitors who want to be right next to the convention center. The hotel facilities are all nice and relatively new, but wouldn't you rather stay somewhere in the downtown area? Staying here isolates you from the action that is in Chicago.",4
1245,"The view was great, the room is clean while being in the middle of ""no where"" in Chicago besides the convention that it sit next to.  This hotel deserves 4 stars for the hospitality of their staff and excellent concierge.  The free shuttle to nearby shopping was most welcome since parking in Chicago is a pain!  The $20 internet killed the deal; this is one of the few Hyatt that still charges for this modern day necessity. -- Especially when they catering to business people by their strategic location.",3
1246,"We had a great night's stay at this Hyatt!  AMAZING bed (actually thinking of calling the hotel to find out what kind it was), very relaxing decor, lovely toiletries (yes, I took the lotion home), Starbucks in the hotel lobby!!  They also had a selection of Chicago made ice cream in a freezer there, yum!  We were able to walk to the heart of downtown in only about 15 mins, not bad at all!  Had a great stay and would definitely stay again for leisure travel!",5
1247,"This hotel was great for what we were doing: passing through town. Our check-in was quick and the desk staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was booked through http://Hotwire.com (which is probably where everyone else that day booked their room, since there was no convention that weekend) and so it came over with a single King bed reservation even though I reserved for 4 people - a knock against Hotwire, not the hotel. Hyatt was happy to move me to a two-double bed room. The room had nice beds and linens, but the pillows were uncomfortable. The elevators were swift and to echo everyone else's statements about the gym: amazing. For gym enthusiasts: free towels, including chilled ones - free headphones, free water, music playing, TVs on, tons of cardio machines, free weights, jump ropes, resistance bands, medicine balls, balance balls, a full range of ROM weight machines, roman chair, etc. - really - AMAZING. The locker rooms have lockers, showers, sauna!! The pool is silly, it's more of a kiddie pool than anything, but the gym is 24 hours, so that's a huge plus. There aren't a million TV channels, and the internet is for-cost but those weren't material to us. It would've been nice to access the internet for questions about where to go to dinner, but the concierge was more than helpful about that. The hotel has really thin walls, we travel with a sound machine, but I could still hear TV in other rooms at 4am - lots of doors opening/closing late at night in the hall, too. Toiletries were above average and nice smelling. Plenty of towels. Room included iron, hairdryer (on closet shelf), bible, chairs, floorspace, mirror, bench. The split bathroom was nice for people traveling with more than one person. Temperature in the hotel was just fine for us, perfect for sleeping. For-cost amenities are over-priced, but we avoided them by bringing out own snacks/drinks and eating elsewhere. I would stay here again!",4
1248,"My #3 choice for hotels in Chicago, its a bit out of the city but about 5 mins of cab ride to the central heart, when I usually work at our Sears Towers offices.",4
1249,Food here is ok... Spent thanksgiving here... For the price of $29 a person... I really could have eaten somewhere else and payed a lol more for the quality being served... However service was top rate... People working here were super friendly and attentive!,3
1250,"I enjoyed my stay...the rooms were nice and people were very friendly.  The one time i ate at the sitdown restaurant there the food was good, but the service could have been a little bit better.  The location is not great unless you are attending a conference there, but all and all it was a good hotel.",3
1251,"First--I did not stay at this Hyatt, I am basing this review on the customer service I experienced regarding clients that were staying at this hotel for a conference. Trying to contact a helpful person at this hotel is like pulling teeth.  I called to see what needed to be done to get welcome gifts placed in each guests room (about 10 guests).  I was transferred around on the phone a total of 6 times and still no one could answer my question.  I was told a manager would call me about it later---never got that call. Once I finally did get answers to my questions, I dropped the gifts off on a Friday to be placed in guests rooms over the weekend (I gave clear instructions to the manager with a list of full names)  She assured me that they would get these gifts in the room (mind you its $3 per drop off). I called on Monday to confirm the drop offs.  First time I called and asked I was placed on hold for 15 minutes.  I ended up hanging up, calling back and spoke to the same manager I left instructions with on friday---nope, no drop offs---and no explanation. So I had to go into bitch mode, to make sure these gifts were delivered ASAP (she actually asked me ""when would you like me to get them to their rooms?"" I wanted to scream: YESTERDAY!) Is it just me or shouldn't a hotel have exceptional customer service--atleast a hotel at the Hyatt level?  Very disappointing.",1
1252,"Beautiful room, with a spacious floor plan and the most impressive shower head I've seen in some time. Conveniently located near Museum Park and Soldier field, there are plenty of close options. The bar and restaurant in house was great, with an amazing staff. The bedding was fantastic and it's been awhile since I've found such a nice bed away from home.",4
1253,Checked in for participating a conference. Quite high rate.,3
1254,"Great location if you have a car.  Really easy to get on the 90 and/or lake Shore Drive. Front desk manager appeared genuinely insulted when she saw how great my  hotwire rate was (it was really great, less than half the price of valet parking at  the other Hyatt...) Room Window opened 5 inches-good by today's standards. Air conditioning was adequate through the night. (some hotels cut down on AC late at night) Only one front desk person was outstanding.  Two were rude. I rented two rooms, one for me, one for a friend.  In order to get to the room at night, if you have a rental car, you must pass your key card to get into the parking lot, pass it again to get into the elevator and again to get into your room. the key failed at one of the three key  points, on nearly every trip. At one point i had them make me three keys, and NONE worked.  my friend made through the three-key gauntlet only once without a front desk change of keys... other than that, the beds were great, room was clean. soaps were a little heavy--if  you want something unscented or not waxy bring your own.  All in all, a fine generic hotel experience with the usual chain store problems--no one in the hotel seemed to take responsibility for the issues.",4
1255,"I made a reservation for June 11th on hotwire. Had to wait in line with 15 other guests and only one poor receptionist. I asked if she could get her manager so we could expedite the line. Was told the manager was in her office!. Guests should be your main concern if you are the manager. So, facing a 45 min wait to check in I thought I would use the self check in computer. Oh silly me!. Of course that was not working either!. A concierge named Chris finnally checked me in. He was very polite. I gave him my credit card for incedentals and my hotwire reservation #. He swiped my card and said my card was over it's limit. It was not. I had to call the credit card company and have then explain to him that he was incorrect. Then 10 min later he was finnally able to find my hotwire reservation. I had called the hotel in advance and had been offered a queen non smoking room. Since I have severe asthma. When we got to put room it was two small beds in a smoking room!. I will try and never stay in this hotel again!. They need to train their front desk staff including their managers.",1
1256,"There were HUGE SPIDERS all over this hotel. The were on the pool chairs, in the lounge, in the outdoor seating areas, and even in our room! I got a few bad bites while I was staying there (and still have the scars over a week later!). The Hyatt is also in the middle of nowhere, in a deserted, fringy neighborhood. I'm a city person, so people drinking on the corner and shouting at me doesn't really upset me, but my 26 year-old suburbanite sister was really freaked out. In (safe) walking distance of NOTHING, not even a bullet-proof deli.",1
1257,"We needed a relatively cheap, central hotel for our vacation to Chicago, and this hotel did just the trick! It sits right on the border of Grant Park, and is only 2 blocks from the El train (which we rode constantly). The room was clean, the people at the front desk were friendly, and I saw some indie band checking out while I was checking in. What more could you want?",4
1258,"Location was good and price was low but I guess thats why they say you get what you pay for. Small, dated rooms. Super small ""suite"" that was hardly soundproof. Had a very difficult time checking in since the room was booked under my friend's father's name. If you plan on sharing a room, the desk required names of each person staying in room in order to obtain room keys, just for a heads up.",2
1259,"We choose this hotel based on price/location. Now with that the hotel is smaller and not as glamorous as other Chicago hotels but better then other Best Westerns I have been too. The rooms are small which is perfectly fine if all you are doing is sleeping and relaxing in between all the wonderful activities Chicago has to offer. The bed was comfortable and I felt like most of the room was updated nicely. The location is the best you are right across from Grant Park, down the street from the Aquarium, and the Art Museum. For people that do not want to walk down to where all the shopping is on the Magnificent Mile then this is not your hotel. It was a decent walk but it was perfectly fine for my husband and me. Parking is valet but we did not use our car once we were in Chicago we simply walked or took pubic transit.",4
1260,"If you are vacationing near the ""Loop"" or around the Field Museum/Shedd Aquarium, Best Western is located in the perfect area. BW also offers the least expensive Valet parking which we had to utilize for our rent a car. Check-in is not until 3pm, knowing we where going to be in the area early, I called the day prior and requested early check in which they honored at 11am as well as provided a complimentarily room upgrade to Lake view, Sweet! Our room was small, but who cares, it's vacation so we didn't stay in it much anyway. Attached to BW is a coffee/asian restaurant which they utilize for their room service food. Customer service was awesome, no complaints what-so-ever. We would stay here again anytime **Also, Lou Malnati's is walking distance so if you like deep dish, your set. .",5
1261,"The hotel staff was attentive and quick upon check in. After having trouble with the internet they were also eager and swift to help. The rooms themselves are clean but out dated. They feature the usual ammentities and an old fashioned television set. The location, however, is great. It is walking distance from a lot of the popular Chicago attractions: shopping, Grant Park, Milenium Park, just to name a few. There is no room service but I recommend take out from Yolk, a nearby restaurant.",4
1262,"Time/Date: Tuesday, 12:30 am Type/Quality: One of the cheaper hotels by Grant Park. It is very clean and comfortable; don't expect frills. Its what you want if your looking for site seeing, wandering around the waterfront, and the food/touristy districts. FREE INTERNET! THUMBS WAY UP. Price/Quantity : The company books cheap rooms, so it couldn't have been expensive Service/Accessibility: The venue is right off of main streets, and easy to find if your walking. It doesn't have a lot of parking but its perfect for travelers. The service is regular ""chain hotel friendly"". They will watch your bags if you want to sight see after your stay and they will leave a key for you if you are coming in late. Structure/Ambiance: Clean and comfortable. The internet is FREE! that makes it wonderful.",4
1263,"I was not impressed with this BW.  It was the 3rd one I stayed at in 10 days and it was the most disappointing.  :( When we were checking in the lady was not very helpful answering our questions.  We asked about parking and she suggested a public lot.  Later another worker said they had valet, so we did that, but why didn't she tell us??  They also neglected to mention that valet doesn't open until 6 am and we were leaving before that...How to get the car??  The morning guy was VERY nice and got it out for us and it was waiting when we came down. The room was clean but not very comfortable.  It was very cold on in the room and on the floors.  The Red Line train was loud and you could hear everyone who got on/off the elevator. I think we paid too much for what we actually got.  But I would stay here again if I had to, I just wouldn't choose it.",2
1264,"Good clean hotel. The only downside was their wireless didn't work BUT they did provide us with an Ethernet cable in less than 5 minutes even though they didn't have one at the front desk.  We were able to connect but even with the cable the Internet was slooooooooow. The location is great as you are 3 minutes from The Metra and buses go by every 3-4 minutes right outside the door.   They have a local restaurant on their bottom floor, it is nothing spectacular but it saves you if you get back to your room late or if the weather forces you to stay inside.",3
1265,"Chose this hotel for price/location. This is a older city hotel- rooms are smaller than you might be accustomed to. That's not a negative, simply a head's up. Prices are reasonable for the location: South Loop in Chicago, Within walking distance of Natural History Museum, right across the street from Grant Park, and close to Columbia College Chicago and DePaul. Easy drive to McCormick Place. Great location! Bed was comfortable, sheets were soft and in good condition. Pillows sucked. Worst pillows I've ever slept on- stuffed with lumpy little pieces of foam. They could/would not give me an extra pillow. A/C was super noisy but it worked. We stayed in a king suite, which is an open L-shaped room w/ a king bed, and a loveseat /single pull out bed in the 'L'. No privacy between the living and bedroom areas, so if that's an issue, get two rooms. No blanket for the pull out bed and three single size pillows for the whole room to use- all lumpy, btw. Fridge and microwave in the room. Again, it's an older city hotel so they don't splurge on space. Great views of the city. It's close to the ""El"" so you will hear the train rumbling by every 10-15 minutes during the day, less at night. Parking is valet with in and out privileges. It fills up quickly so you will have to call to specifically reserve a space or check-in early. We were unaware of this. There is a public valet parking garage right next door for a few dollars more but without in and out service. However, you are in such a great location that you can walk or take public transport or a taxi with no problems. I would stay here again because of the location/price, and I would recommend it, but, those pillows... oh my gosh... Please fix those pillows!",3
1266,after a 4 hour middle of the night drive from St.louis ( not the brightest idea Sarah) anyhow we were in town 8 hours before check in on no sleep however at like 9 am we stopped by the hotel and were allowed early check in at no additional fee now I know this can't always be done for guests but they were able to accomadate us this time I will be back,4
1267,"Slowest. Brunch. Ever. When Yolk up the street had a 45-minute wait for Sunday brunch, I opted to come here with my parents, who were in town for the weekend. When we were first seated, alarm bells should have gone off when we had to repeatedly flag down the wait staff for coffee. Matters did not improve by the time we ordered. It took almost an hour for our dishes--not complex to begin with, think oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and fruit-- to reach the table. Although the prices are reasonable and the place was not crowded, do not let these facts lull you into thinking that the service will be fast.",2
1268,It's a great location and the staff is VERY helpful.  Easy to get a cab and an excellent restaurant next door ...... also with helpful and freindly staff.  About a $5 cab ride to McCormick Place Convention Center. My only complaint about the hotel is the Internet connectivity......it sucks.  Best Western needs to work on that issue. Can't say enough good things about Chicago.  I'll be back!,3
1269,"Functional. Don't get a room on 11th  street side. Faces a music schl=loud music all day.  Tiny rooms. Huge gap under door to room. Holly nice desk girl. Night staff underwhelming. I'm not messy, but I never had a housekeeper in my room the entire time. I would like to have my coffee replenished and fresh towels, but had to ask for them every night because the housekeeper didn't come to my room.  Loud door slamming ALL night, and someone kept smoking in the hall.  The heater was next to the thin windows so it kept going non stop and that side of the room was freezing while the other side was HOT.  The wall thermostat was broken so I had to keep walking to the thing to adjust it.  Also, the lighting sucks in the bathroom. and NO water pressure in the shower.",2
1270,"This Best Western is the closest hotel to McCormick Place other than the Hyatt McCormick, but it is not exactly walking distance to McCormick Place. This decent hotel at the southern edge of downtown is well situated if you are going to the museums or to Soldier Field, but you are away from the shopping action of the Magnificent Mile.",3
1271,phenomenal breakfast. great pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the lady at meets you at the door in AM. is the sweetest person alive. On the real.... the whole staff is nice,5
1272,I rented a room here for new year's but it seems as if the Best Western is a hotel chain suited for college students and twenty somethings to have parties at. This is the second BW I stayed in since the first one was in Charleston in southern IL and even they were the same way college students renting rooms and just being an overall disturbance. Because it was new years the pre and post drunken behavior is a given especially for those who don't have much in the way of being considerate of other guests who would like to have some peace and quiet. The hotel should make college students sign waivers so they're put on notice about being asked to leave if they're being disruptive and disturbing other guests and destroying hotel property. Not to mention the train going by every 10 mins which makes it hard to sleep at night. Breakfast was mediocre it could have offered healthy choices like egg whites and skim milk. Not to mention it was rather weird to have some homeless guy saluting buses as they passed on the street and harassing pedestrians as they walked down the street and then dancing in front of the window as me and my boyfriend ate breakfast. Either way the stay could have been better.,3
1273,"Even though I live nearby, we decided to spend a night at the Ritz for my birthday.  What a fun and extravagant experience it was!  The hotel is beautiful, the service wonderful, and the atmosphere decadent! Some things I really loved and appreciated: The room: -L'occitane bath products, the amazingly comfortable pillow top bed, the humongous windows, temperature control, beautiful bathroom, and a waiting bottle of champagne on ice with chocolate covered strawberries to welcome us!   -The window drapes totally block out any bit of light which leads to amazing sleep. -Also appreciated the phone in the bathroom (which actually came in handy once when I needed to call down but didn't want to wake up my boyfriend), turn-down service which comes with bottled water, a wonderful view of the city.   -He also asked to have chocolate cake sent up to celebrate my birthday and what arrived at 8:30 on the dot was an amazing chocolate cupcake complete with candles, matches, and a bottle of Evian to enjoy. The hotel: -The lobby is gorgeous, with crystal chandeliers and a fountain and a jazz band playing in the evening.   -The service was super nice.  I actually had a cold and needed some Advil, and called down late to see if the gift shop was still open.  They asked me to come down to the front desk, where I was asked if I was looking for medication (indeed I was) and offered a tray of options.  Cost $9 but was totally needed and I'm glad I didn't have to make a late-night run to find a convenience store. -Also each time you call the operator for help they call you by your name which is a nice touch. -Attached to Water Tower which was great for a little shopping I had been meaning to catch up on. Some random things that could be better, but are not enough of a big deal to change the rating from 5 to 4 stars: -You have to take to sets of elevators to get to your room, and the elevators are a little small so sometimes you have to wait a little -Although my boyfriend added my name to the room (we checked in separately)--when I arrived I was treated a little like I was trying to sneak in or something, and it's interesting how the service is for a customer vs. a potential customer.  Very mild difference, but definitely different.   -There is a way to plug in your Iphone/Ipod into the TV to play music--however it is cumbersome (you have to download and sign up for this app called LodgeNet Mobile) and it takes a bit of time, and even then I couldn't figure out how to use it. -The wifi is free but not that good, actually turned it off and used my 3G network which worked a lot better. I admit I am super-high maintenance, but I loved loved loved the Ritz.  For a fun night in the city I would definitely come back again!  Can't wait to try the spa next time!",5
1274,"My wife and stayed here for our tenth anniversary celebration and I broke my toe on furniture in the room. I know what your thinking, but that is not how. They had a chair set up near the bed with a foot stool. When I got out of bed I wacked my toe on the leg of the footstool. I told tthe manager and was basical shown to the security officer and treated like a criminal, instead of a long time customer.mind you, I never asked for special consideration or a freebie. None was offered, unsurprisingly Also, the hot tub had brown moosh on the inside that looked like feces. I refused to go in that mess and when I told management of the spa, it remained uncleaned for several hours and past cCheck out. The Ritz is not the quality hotel it once was. When were weren't asleep, there was a steady stream of elevaror noise. Beware of rooms with a 33 or 32 in their suffix.  The Ritz is not the quality hotel it once was.",1
1275,"This review is for the hotel cafe/bar and parking -- I did not stay here but visited friends who were (and forgot to check in on Yelp... #amateur). Coming from a Chicagoan, the location of the hotel could not be any more central; it's steps from all the major spots in the city. The lobby at the Ritz is lovely, but getting there can be a bit confusing as it isn't actually on the ground floor. I had my car valet parked (the prices are much higher than any garage), and then I was instructed to take the elevators to the 12th floor. Once I arrived, we went to the cafe for drinks. I had some of the best cappuccino I have ever had. I have no idea what it cost, but they were made with good espresso and had proper foam. I don't think I judge anything harsher in life than cappuccinos, haha, so if I say it was good, it was GOOD! They are 1/3 of a Starbucks tall (read: size of a real capp in Europe) but so good that I savoured every molecule vs. the mammoth Starbucks size which I gulp down in a few minutes. If it was $4-5, I would gladly pay that here because, although a fraction of the size, the quality was worth it. It also came with a wonderful biscotti that had cranberries in it, I believe.. Yum. Just yum. Our tray of pistachios was constantly replenished as were glasses of water; the servers were very attentive. There is also free Wi-Fi. My only complaint would be that there is no bathroom at the bottom. I didn't realize that I had to go until I was waiting for my car, and from there I discovered that I would either have to go back to the 12th-floor lobby or up to the food court at neighboring Water Tower. All in all, a pleasant experience. I wouldn't go back on my own, but if you want to invite me, I won't say no. ;)",4
1276,"Service- great! Location-great! Sleeping rooms-great! Bathrooms in sleeping rooms- cramped and outdated. Overall hotel lobby and feel of the property- stone age. Refresh your common space!! My husband and I stay here on his comapny's dime from time to time and we call it ""Ritz the pitz"" compared to other hotels we've stayed at in the city. Get with the times guys!!!",3
1277,This place is just a little bit ridic.  The lobby is outstanding and the staff and amenities are out of this world.  We did a luncheon/presentation over three days w. groups of about 20 each and could not have been happier with the level of service we received.   The food we had over the three days was also fairly amaze.,4
1278,"Another knock it out of the park experience with a Ritz property.  I don't know how to convey this but of course there is always the nice finishes that go along with a Ritz.  The real difference is the customer service as I've said before. Here's an example.  Checking in, chatting with the person across the desk he asked if I would be catching a game at Wrigley.  I tell him yes and go about my way.  Later that evening I return and he crosses my path to the elevator and ask me how the game was using my specific last name.  THAT my friend is going above and beyond no matter how simple it may seem. Bottom line, they  treat you like gold and this particual hotel has residences with doormen too that help grab cabs, etc. Fun note: I actually rode the elevator down with Lebron James here!  So be on the lookout for celebs!",5
1279,"I checked out of the hotel at an ungodly hour of the morning and, in my stupor, ended up forgetting my padfolio in the cab when it dropped me off at Yolk (best breakfast ever!). I called the Ritz and they put me in touch with the doorman. He remembered the cab driver and, when that guy pulled up again, he rescued my padfolio and called me to say he had it! Kind of a miracle, no? I swung by on the way to my interview, got my padfolio, and tipped the doorman $5. Writing this, I feel bad for not giving him more.",5
1280,"Service.  It is truly what sets apart the Ritz chain of hotels from other hotels. You see it in the smallest ways.  The front desk clerk coming from behind the counter to personally hand you your key.  The doorman who runs back to your valet parked car to grab a bag you forgot and then brings it to the meeting room you are in.  The staff cleaning the public restrooms who greets you when you enter and says good bye when you leave. All small gestures . . . .but gestures that don't go unnoticed. The rooms are not as opulent as they might have once seemed as other chains have picked up their game but they are nice.  Oh sure, the rooms are over sized, and have a bed with the best  pillows, linens and duvets but they don't feel ""over the top"" as I used to think Ritz hotels were. The bathrooms are adorned with marble and feature L'Occitane products which are always appreciated.  And the deep tub is always welcome in a world of hotel rooms that is quickly becoming a ""shower nation"". Internet is free and there is a small mini bar in the room.  What was missing for me, though, was coffee in the room.  I know I could call and have a pot delivered to me, but i just wanted to slurp down a cup without all the hassle of getting dressed, etc. Many of the meeting rooms have terrific views of the lake and of the city.  Even the staff that work the private banquet functions are super friendly and nice, helping to do whatever you need even before you know that you need it. So I'll end as I began.  At the Ritz, it's all about the service.  And while that model has been copied by many of the high end resorts that I have the privilege to visit, it is still evident in everything that they do here.  And that is much appreciated by this ""road weary"" traveler!",4
1281,"My mother and sister in law attended afternoon tea here last weekend.  We had done it before 2 years prior and found it to be one of the better teas offered in the city.  Unfortunately, they've changes some things around and we experienced terrible service. Last time when there was an afternoon tea we were in the section underneath/surround by all the windows with city views.  This time, we were told our reservation for tea was in their itty bitty, open and uncharismatic restaurant.  Points lost for change of scene and seeing the city.  Then, there was no harpist or carolers or anything that represented this quaint holiday tradition.  Instead it just sounded like we were in a field house.   All that aside, the service was terrible.  Especially considering it's the Ritz...I would think they'd have people kissing your ass left and right.  We were 10 mins early for our 4pm reservation, and yet weren't sat until 4:20.  This is only after we witnessed the entire 'lobby' (by the fountain) clear out and everyone else sat that had come after us....I actually went up to the host and pointed this out to which he brought us to a table that wasn't set.   The wait staff was horrific throughout the entire experience.  We spoke to about 4 different servers, each bringing something different.  Our original server that took our order, never came back to get our wine order.  We had to flag him down.  No one ever came by to check in on us, or worse, refill our wine glasses.  We grabbed a bus boy to do so.  Then when the check came, it sat for 20 minutes and when still no one had come by to pick it up, we had to flag down yet another waiter to run the card. Never again Ritz.",1
1282,"We had a lovely experience at the Ritz-Carlton Chicago. LOCATION:  Very conveniently located to major attractions, Michigan Ave, & Rush St. STAFF:  Haven't encountered one sour puss. Everyone from door man to front desk & concierege to housekeeping has been perfectly pleasant and acccomodating. QUIRKS:  You take one set of elevators from street level to the lobby (12th floor). You take a different set of elevators from the lobby (12th floor) up to the guest rooms. And a third elevator takes you from the lobby down to the next level (11th floor) where the pool, exercise room and spa are located. The pool is one of the only amenities that appears in need of a renovation. It seems dark, uninviting and a throw-back to hotel pools of yesteryear. After a day of sightseeing and shopping, we mistakenly thought we'd chill poolside, take a dip, enjoy a beverage (avec tiny paper umbrella) and read a book. To our dismay, the room was dark and cavelike, the seating was sparse, and the pool was roped off into 4 lanes making it more of a lap pool than a place to unwind. And, there was no tiki bar. ROOM:  Quite comfortable. Large window across far end of room looks out over city. Comfortable couch. Spacious dresser with in-room safe and plenty of drawer space. Comfortable bed, soft linens. Two night stands. Stylish furnishing - not too edgy and not too ""starving artists sale out at the airport."" Nice sized flat screen TV on swivel stand on dresser. Large desk with office chair. Plenty of lighting and lamps. Nice sized closet with plenty of hangers. Separate bar/fridge area. BATH:  Spacious. Double sinks/vanities. Separate room with toilet and shower. 2 robes and 2 slippers provided for use during stay. Towels soft but still confident in structure and oversized. L'OCCITANE products including: 3 bar soaps, hand lotion, shower gel, shampoo & conditioner. Small canister on vanity with cotton balls, cotton pads and Q-tips).  Bath mats in front of toilet/shower and in front of sinks. Hair dryer. OTHER:   A little bar appears in the morning near the front desk area in the lobby with coffee, tea, espresso and a small assortment of pastries. It's adjacent to the hotel's business center, where I sit at this moment, composing this review. It's open 24 hours/day and offers a Mac and two PCs for guests' use. A fine place to slip away should one of you be an early bird and want to allow your other to sleep, hypothetically.",4
1283,"WOW. Best hotel I've ever stayed at. I tend to like modern / minimalist hotels and while the Ritz wasn't that it struck a nice balance between old elegance and modern. The service was PHENOMENAL. The staff were what tipped the scale. Everyone was friendly and helpful. They help elevators open for you. Loved turn down service. Concierge was friendly when I asked for advice on places to eat. Facilities were great (nice pool and lobby). Location was convenient. The views facing lake Michigan were awesome. Loved that you could get your shoes shines for free by leaving them in a bag. My girlfriend joked that if they could legally walk you to the bathroom and hold your hand they would. It was a joke but exemplary of the extent to which they value customer service. Everything just came together. Very impressed. Video: View from our room: http://www.flickr.com/ph… Also, was very happy with the free wireless ( wifi ). It was slow but if that bothers you it is only $10 a day for faster wireless.",5
1284,"Deca Bar is very nice for a jazzy time in Chi! IJazz Radio has free jazz at the Deca Bar on Friday nights. So you know I had to try it out. Though the bar did not start on time, the place was great, the food was gos food, and the wine was tasty. I tried a new wine line, Dr. Hermann (white); it was sweet, wet, and smooth. The price was a little above what I usually pay for wine ($9), but this was ok. I then tried something on the menu; the pork sliders. This was really good and I enjoyed each bite. I also like that nuts were served with the drinks...thanks for this! The space is so pretty. The were lots of seating around (comfy too). The sound for the music was also good. I liked that even though this bar is close to the hotel restaurant, you really can not hear them on the other side. Staff was good, service was ok. My only improvement would be for the hotel to have some professional signage about were the event was taking place. A few staff members did not know that the even is placing place nor its time. To my knowledge, it is open to the public, so we need to be aware of where we are going. Deca Bar was not listed in the ads by IJazz, so that is something all parties can work on. Other than that, I had a great time here at the Deca Bar and I can still taste those pork sliders...yum!",4
1285,"It would be a sin to give this Ritz anything but five stars. Everything is flawless there. It's almost too flawless. From the valet's perfectly tailored clothing to the decor with not a smidgen of dirt to be found anywhere, this Ritz puts on the Ritz in their own hotel. I must admit, I felt a little grungy when I was a guest here at the Ritz and I'm far from a grungy person. But even wearing sundresses and pants with nice tops didn't seem to be quite elegant enough for the Ritz. Had I known, I would have packed my pearls and worn tailored dresses the whole time. That's what everyone else was wearing at least. The men were in suits or should I say, ""casual suits"" during the day and the women were in the same. We were about 30 years younger than any other guest at the Ritz so maybe that's why we got so many looks. But attitudes and guest attire aside, this hotel is spectacular. The lobby is on the 12th floor of the Water Tower so don't let the street entrance fool you. That's just a precursor to the glory. You exit the first group of elevators and enter a majestic setting of floor to ceiling windows and a huge lobby, lounge and restaurant overlooking the city of Chicago with the first view being of the Hancock building. Plus, don't forget about the Roman-like fountain placed perfectly in the center of the lobby. The rooms are just as magical as the lobby. Everything is clean. Everything is quiet. I didn't hear one peep from one guest or staffer my entire stay. It's like you enter into your own little royal world when you stay in a room at the Ritz. Some highlights include: - The beds. Oh heaven...the beds. I could have slept my way through vacation but the city of Chicago deserves more from me. - The bath products. They provide L'Occitane products in the bathrooms. Splendid. - The service. Completely perfect and professional from the minute of check-in to check out and this includes the run in with the maids and the valet giving me an umbrella when it started to rain. Some tips: If you are looking for five star service, in a five star setting, in the heart of Chicago, you can't do much better than the Ritz. Be sure to find time to sit in the lounge/bar area overlooking the city for a drink and if you are there on Sunday and have the time and funds, enjoy the Sunday brunch. I didn't eat it, but the smells and appearance told me it's worth every penny! So goodbye Ritz, until hopefully one day when I can visit again. I promise next time, I'll remember to pack my pearls!",5
1286,"Just a review for the Greenhouse, the bar at the Ritz. Good live music played at just the right volume, great bartenders, lovely setting.",5
1287,"They are super kid friendly at The Ritz-Carlton Chicago, and color me impressed: from check-in to check-out, this Four Seasons Chicago extension felt pitch perfect throughout. And I don't know why this isn't the norm, but it was really amazing to stay at a top flight hotel without feeling like the little one was an extra burden. She went everywhere we went, and they could not have been more accommodating. Some interesting sidebars: as the Ritz is right off Michigan Ave, even though you're in tourist central there's loads of shopping nearby if that's your thing, and some great restaurant options as well. I especially liked the idea that they'll rent an iPad 2 to you for twenty bucks a day if you want some high tech help seeing the city, and were it not for the fact that my face is usually affected by the pallor of my computer screen all too often, I'd have rented one, too. The lounge is spacious, opens up to the panoramic windows besides, and the service was prompt without looming. But in the end, often these stays are about the rooms themselves, and the one we stayed in couldn't have been more comfortable. Request a lake view if you can.",5
1288,"Not my favorite.  This hotel is old and is starting to show its age.   Minus one star because it doesn't feel completely clean to me, though I can't quite describe why. Minus another star because there's no coffee in the lobby in the mornings and the walk to Michigan Avenue, though only half a block, feels really long for some reason. Picky, I know, but I just don't see why one would stay here when the Four Seasons on Delaware is so much better.",3
1289,The most comfortable beds on the planet.,5
1290,"Great customer service always wins my loyalty. I found my stay at the Ritz-Carlton (technically a Four Seasons hotel) consistent with other Four Seasons experiences. Mostly the Austin Four Seasons, since I haven't stayed at tons of these hotels. From now on, any time I can afford it, this hotel brand is my number one pick. We were traveling to Chicago with a little one in tow, so a child friendly hotel was our number one priority. We arrived a few hours before it was time us to check-in, so the staff checked our bags for us, and we were able to go out to lunch and explore the city. Upon check-in, the reception gave our little nugget a stuffed dog to play with. When we got into our room (the lake view is great!) our bags arrived minutes later, then they brought us a crib complete with a care package of diapers, wipes, baby wash, etc. The location was perfect, and when the downpour hit on our first morning, we were able to relax with an amazing breakfast  at Deca and make our way to the stores attached to the lobby for some shopping until the sun broke through the clouds.",5
1291,"If I could've just moved in here, I would've. The bed was incredibly comfortable, we got an amazing view from a high floor, the complimentary breakfast was delicious, and the location is great! The concierge was friendly and helpful and I don't have a single negative thing to say about it.",5
1292,I LOVE THE RITZ CARLTON HOTEL. I love it.   -The location is in the heart of downtown Chicago. -GREAT CONCIERGE. - The service here is EXCEPTIONAL. the bellman always comes very very quickly so don't forget to tip.   -Beautiful Christmas decorations!!!!!!!! -Very spacious bathroom -They are prompt with everything -Modern feel You won't regret staying here.   Beautiful! This is better than Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.  I highly highly recommend it.,5
1293,"Attended a church gala on Saturday night in the 12th floor ballroom. The venue was very classy, and the food was great (filet, scalloped potatoes, asparagus). If you are looking to host a mid to large event, I'd recommend the space.",5
1294,This is by far my favorite Chicago Hotel. The location is great and the service is impeccable. This hotel is a class act the moment you arrive. I definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a luxury hotel in Chicago.,5
1295,"Pathetic! After a 45 minute taxi ride, our room is not ready? 5:00pm and our room is not ready, really? I expect that from a Holiday Inn not a Ritz Carlton. Lame.",2
1296,"Since they renovated I think I can now give this Four Seasons 5 stars.   The rooms are beautiful.  Their recent, much needed renovation level set the product with the service.  The lobby is modern and elegant with a gorgeous greenhouse bar and the Deca restaurant.  The rooms aren't all as spacious as you'd expect for the price, but they quality is there and the bathrooms are beautiful.   Service is always exceptional.  I've been staying at this hotel since I was a kid (shopping trips with mom) and the standard of service has never fallen.  There are still some waiters in the restaurant (now Deca, was the Cafe) that were there when I was a kid.  They are very good at making people feel welcome and at home.  Every whim is catered to.  As long as its legal ;) A great hotel with outstanding service and quality rooms.",5
1297,"I was highly disappointed.  The room itself and atmosphere was nice, but I had a terrible parking experience.  Seems to be that b/c they're an expensive hotel they think they can absolutely gauge their guests on all fronts.   I paid for parking which I thought was $45 for 24 hours (still really high).  Come to find out the hard way that it's 24 hours or up until 3 pm the next day, which comes first.  In my case, I was parked for about 21 hours and paid $74!!!!!!!!  Outrageous.  I spoke to a couple different people and got no where.  ""it's the policy""   My policy - stay elsewhere.  Nice hotels aren't hard to fine, go with one that has better service and concern for their guests.",1
1298,"Most of the first afternoon of my neuroscience conference was spent running frantically through the convention center trying desperately to pick up a mobile signal (and cursing lack thereof) whilst checking out posters, bumping into friends, and juggling the week's worth of program books, so it's possible I looked slightly disheveled when I stepped into the elevator at the Ritz-Carlton. Mind you, I wasn't staying at the Ritz-Carlton, but a non-neuro friend of mine happened to be there for a wedding, and I wanted to squeeze in a quick visit.  I had her room number, so I was planning on just nonchalantly walking in and heading up like a normal person going to visit a friend in a hotel, but they have to make it so confusing for us plebians!  The lobby is on the 12th floor.  Who does that?? There was a fancy family in the first elevator with me, and it was clear that they were not pleased about having to share the same air with someone in a 2004 H&M coat carrying two bags, hair in a messy ponytail.  Fancy dad said to fancy mom, ""you know what I noticed, these are the same elevators as at the Ritz in New York!"" and really, it was all I could do not to jump in with ""OMG I KNOW, isn't that greeeeaat??? I can't tell you how pleased I am to see that the old R-C is consistent in their design."" When we switched to the 2nd elevator, they rolled their eyes and fancy mom said to fancy dad, ""you know, at the Ritz in New York, you can't get in the elevator unless you have a key."" It was then that I really wished I'd been dressed like a prostitute instead of a harried neuroscientist.  Just for fun, you know.  A little Pretty Woman quote fest, perhaps?   ""Oh honey, I've got a runner in my pantyhose!  I'm not wearing pantyhose!"" My friend's room was totally gorgeous, with a view of the lake and the ferris wheel.  It was all done up in decadent periwinkle blue (just like at the NY R-C, I imagine) with a giant luxurious bed and a 2-sink bathroom that was bigger than some NYC apartments (or the Blue Banana, if you're still with me and my PW references).   One day when I'm rich I'm going to come back to the Chicago R-C and I'm going to get in that elevator like a pro and with that awful fancy family watching, I'm going to hit the f-ing PH button.",4
1299,"I haven't stayed at the hotel, but came by for drinks in the lobby recently. I have to say, it is breathtaking.  I absolutely love hotel lobbies, and the Ritz Carlton may be my new favorite. The area is grand, very large with a huge fountain right in the center of the room. Classic moldings, gorgeous floral arrangements (although I am pretty sure the orchids are fake), and picture perfect seating arrangements makes the lobby a great place for a drink, a date or afternoon tea with friends. I had a dirty vodka martini and my friend had the toasted almond martini... both were delicious.  Service was excellent, very attentive :)  I like that. What I love most about this place is that it's not a place to be seen. Just an elegant setting with great ambiance and service. I'll update the review when I stay at the hotel.",4
1300,"This hotel has the most beautiful lobby in all of Chicago.  Guaranteed.  I know because we visited every darn hotel in downtown Chicago looking for the best lobby to take wedding photos in.  This idea was the perfect solution to a middle of July wedding where outside pictures would equal one sweaty bride, groom, and wedding party. The lobby has a beautiful fountain with lots of open windows that lets in lots of natural sunlight.  Past the fountain, there is a whole wing that leads to the ballroom areas and it is beautifully decorated with damask carpeting, beautiful chandeliers, and furniture that is equally modern and classic. The moment we saw it, thoughts of the Drake and the Peninsula were out the window. Of course, we didn't just sneak in with 15 people to take pictures in this beautiful space, we stayed here too!  We had an amazing suite with breathtaking views of the city.  It was probably the nicest hotel room I have ever seen, and was also the perfect space for the getting ready wedding photos....  And of course, the perfect space for our wedding night. I also got to experience the spa and I had an awesome massage and a fabulously relaxing experience in the steam room. It was the perfect stress reliever the morning before the wedding! If I was a total baller and could have a platinum wedding at any hotel in Chicago, this would absolutely be the one. We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of this hotel's amazing space for photos and experience the luxury of this hotel for our wedding night.  I am hoping we can make another visit on our anniversary.",5
1301,"This review is for afternoon tea only. My Mom and I love afternoon tea. We go whenever possible no matter what city we're in and usually the Ritz no matter the city is outstanding. It's usually a safe bet for excellent service and quality. Not so here. Now, I'm familiar with the Chicago Ritz. I've dined here many times for dinner and the greenhouse room is a gorgeous place to stop by for a drink (pink champagne is a must). But the tea? Expensive? Yes. Worth it? No way. So disappointing! Everything had been pre-done the night or days before and then must have sat in a refrigerator. It tasted like it too. It had that old food taste. And not just the soggy and stale sandwiches. Everything tasted old. My Mom thinks now that her salmon turned. She later complained of a stomach ache from something but we're not too sure what got her ill there. I probably dodged that bullet because after my one bite of turkey that tasted day old or older I was done with the sandwich portion. My poor Mom felt better the next day but had a bad night. So it was sort of like bad icing on a really nasty cake. There was nothing fresh. Even the scones seemed nuked and were cold in places rather than being recently baked. The rolls seemed pre-done somewhere else. And who eats a cold roll with hot tea? The tea was fair. I'm something of a tea snob and would guess they're buying in massive bulk at a cheap price. It's not Mariage Frères or anything high quality by any stretch of the imagination--but they'll charge you like it is. They treat their teas badly too. They plunked the green and the black teas down on our table at the same high temperatures and then let the leaves sit the entire hour we were there meaning the last cup of tea had turned bitter by then. It's like they filled the pots from the red spigot by the industrial coffee maker. This is not how tea has ever been served to us at any other Ritzes before. Each tea has it's own temperature and time. Usually this is completely respected and every attention is paid to the finest of details. Uh...not here. Add to that not one of the three servers working the entire room could give us any help in tea selection. We each said what types of teas we enjoyed and asked them to recommend some things and the servers went and asked each other before deciding they couldn't ""decide for us"" Huh? Hoookay...... I asked for milk for my tea (East coast girls don't do cream XD) and it took over twenty minutes for the milk to arrive. The ONE time tea was poured for us (the first), (and the pots were HEAVY--too heavy for my  Mom so I had to pour for her the entire time) was when I was in the ladies room. I came out to find tepid tea waiting for me. I also couldn't find a server to help when my cup had a huge sharp chip on the rim. After ten minutes of looking around, I gave up and drank from the other side. Ridiculous to have to do that at $30+! One of our water glasses had someone else's old lipstick on the rim. Yuck. We kept asking each other is this the Ritz? Srsly? Ew. Pretty room. Bad service. Bad quality. Horrible after experience with my Mom getting ill. Next time I'll try somewhere else. This is not worth it at all.",1
1302,"I see no reason to give this place any less that 5 stars. Excellent service, clean rooms and comfortable beds. Big props to the concierge for the Il Mulino recommendation. WOW!",5
1303,"Our entire experience was perfect. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. The concierge was able to get us a dinner reservation at 7:00 that we would not otherwise got ourselves. The workout facility is very nice, and I especially liked the peppermint infused towels. The room is very clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and had one of the best pillows I have ever slept on.  Beautiful hotel and I would stay again the next time I am in Chicago.",5
1304,"My fiancé and I stayed 3 luxurious nights in the Anniversary Suite for New Years.  We had arrived early so, we had the concierge hold our luggage until the room was ready.  During our wait, we ate at the cafe for lunch.  We waited 15-20 minutes for our meal. Since it was a minor inconvenience, the manager offered us 2 complimentary glasses of the Cabernet Sauvignon we were drinking.  I thought that was pretty nice...  I had the ""Four Storey Hill Farm Young Chicken, Yukon Gold Potato Purée, Baby Turnips, Crimini Mushrooms, Roasted Garlic Jus"".  That was probably the most memorable restaurant chicken meal I've ever had.  The meat was so tender and had excellent flavor. Not too overpowering... The vegetables were perfect.   As we got to our room, our luggage was already set up for us.  I'm not going to blabber about the details in the room.  The pictures speak for themselves... That night, we attended a black tie event in the greenhouse area.  There was a live band, our own private ice sculpture at our table! And a gourmet buffet adorned with fresh sushi, rack of lamb, caviar, French breads and cheeses, oysters, and so much more.  It was a feast! The last night we were there, I also had tried the ""Butternut Squash Lasagna, Butternut Squash Purée, Ricotta Cheese, Walnuts, Spinach""  -absolutely amazing... If you don't mind spending some coin for a luxurious hotel stay, this is the place to go.  Excellent service, convenient, great location, right at the center of the Magnificent Mile.  And I almost forget to mention I'm one of those gals that like 'free' stuff. -ha... I collected about $200 worth of L'Occitane soaps and conditioners.  Hey! It's good stuff can you blame me!? We had a fabulous time here...",5
1305,"My partner was offered a free night here, which we spent this weekend. Overall, our stay was fine. But nothing exceptional. Our room was oddly arranged, with the TV facing the desk and the chairs facing the bed and nothing facing the view. The chairs were highly uncomfortable, too. Also, $13 for a small pot of coffee in your room? LAME. I found the lobby rather ugly. It was nice to stay here, but I won't recommend it.",2
1306,"I had my engagement party here and the staff was nothing short of amazing. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended if you are thinking about having an event. The restaurant here is now closed and used as event space. It is SO grand. Wood paneling, chandeliers everywhere, and  does not feel banquety at all. The food was incredible, everyone said it was the best they'd had at a party at a hotel. They also gave us a really great rate for all of our out of town guests which is unusual for pretty much any hotel where you are just having an event and not using a huge block of rooms. We hired the Bandoleros who are also great for parties, they sound a lot like the Gypsy Kings. All in all it was a spectacular event and wouldn't have been quite so fabulous without the help of the magical team of the RCH.",5
1307,"This is not are review for hosting an event at the Ritz., or traveling on business at the Ritz. This is a ""my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a night downtown"" type of review. As such, our stay was a little underwhelming. The location, staff, and room service were all at a five star level but, sadly other aspects of our stay made us feel like this hotel is just not worth the price tag. Our room was a bit shabby, the mini bar looked to be on it's last leg and the carpet was coming up all along the edges of the room. While I was waiting for my husb to arrive, I tried to watch some TV. The cable service was terrible. Half the channels were out and it took about 3-5 seconds for the picture to appear when changing channels. There was also a slight error in our room service order (received decaf coffee instead of regular). We would have thought nothing of these small inconveniences had we been paying about $200 less for the room.  Next time we stay downtown we'll be doing  just that by booking a room somewhere else.",3
1308,"Can you really go wrong with the Ritz? We stayed here for a little ""getaway"" one weekend. Everyone always knows your name, which I am still not sure how they pull that off. Service....impeccable, food the same, and drinks were great too. You really do get what you pay for. The room was a little ""dated"" in my opinion, but still had the comfy bed, fridge, and great bathroom. I can't say enough about the gym, I wish my condo had a gym like that. Headphones a plenty and great machines, and they actually had free weights over 25 pounds! Oh, and I also saw Juwan Howard pull up in his blue Ferrari, he looked a little tight in there, but it was still a sweet ride",4
1309,"Overnight (a Tuesday) in the city for the Billy Joel/Elton John show.  All hotels, I mean all, were booked so we decided to splurge. On the positive: + Friendly and prompt doorman, he greeted us by name hours later when we left for the evening. + I really appreciate genuine courtesy, with no pretense.  We received that upon check-in. + The concierge knew we were in for the concert and had directions to Wrigley pre-printed upon our arrival. + Very clean, and well decorated room...spotless room/bathroom; drawer liners; white, I mean white, bedding. + Tasty and speedy room service - available at all hours (we ate at 1:00 am) + Lovely in-room breakfast...things that were supposed to be hot were hot and chilled things were chilled. + Early check-in request granted (11 am) + Late check-out request granted (Noon) + Great location + Beautiful lobby + Friendly and professional staff +++++ A lake view without requesting it...this never happens to us without an upgrade request. Stellar service example... - Although laundered, one of our robes had a nasty stain on the butt- ewhhh...we called their attention to it and we were rushed a new robe and our room-service bill was comped without even requesting that.  They just took care of it, and apologized three times for it. Room for Improvement - Housekeeping seems to have the glitches - stationary set had not been checked in a while...kinda ratty and marked up - stained robe in the room previously mentioned - morning paper/breakfast order had been placed via hang card, but  did not get turned in -  therefore our breakfast was not delivered at the requested time, and had to be reordered...when called to their attention they had it to us in record time with many apologies...the breakfast was part of our package so we were not charged for it. We would/will return.  Really appreciated being appreciated for staying. :)",5
1310,"The hotel staff are very hospitable, I love the fact that this hotel is pet friendly & the bar is lovely but every time I stay here I feel like something is missing.  I cannot figure it out!   The people are fantastic, the workout room is spacious/nice & the spa is small but it works.",4
1311,"If a Ritz Carlton were to marry a Four Seasons (later in life) after they already established themselves (without children)... this is what you would get-- the Ritz Carlton - a Four Seasons Hotel.  Of course the Ritz Carlton would be 20 years Four Seasons senior... however a happy marriage all the same. We experienced the contemporary feel and service of the Four Seasons with the layout and history of the Ritz Carlton.  Rooms were more outdated than previous Four Seasons that I have stayed in, however moderately updated with details sprinkled around every corner. The indoor pool, sauna, and fitness center were standard for a Ritz Carlton, however the water aerobics class took up 3 of the 4 lanes in the morning.  The ice service in the afternoon was thoughtfully timed, however the turn down service did not include chocolates waiting for us on our pillows... something I always look forward to. The location was ideal for shopping and restaurants (steps from the Magnificent Mile).  We were centrally located to everything we tentatively had planned for our stay, but due to the humidity in the middle of summer -- we found ourselves enjoying the comforts of our hotel rather than walking around. When visiting Chicago in the future, I may stay here again...",4
1312,I love the Ritz..  Service is by far second to none. This my 2nd time back and it was we enjoyed relaxing in our comfortable bed after a LONG day shopping with my wife.  (And I mean long)  We enjoy the helpful staff and all around great service.  Our linens were replenished and fresh when we returned to our room. We will be back again next year and can't wait!  A bit pricey but worth it!,4
1313,"I stayed at the Ritz on a business trip in Chicago. I must say that otherwise, this hotel is entirely out of my price range. The service was EXCELLENT and I loved my room... huge window... free wireless... comfy bed... large bathroom. It was all very elegant. My only complaint is that the general style of the hotel is a little too old school for my taste. Anyway,  all in all, it was a lovely stay. OH! AND the secret service was outside of my room all night the first night I was there protecting someone quite important... I never did find out who...",4
1314,Staff was awesome and the bed was extremely comfortable.  I didn't want to leave the room for my meetings!  And they had free basic wifi.,5
1315,"First and probably only chance to stay at the Ritz Carlton and it lived up to it's name.  I had a great time!  By the 2nd day our family's mantra was ""I lov e the Ritz.""  Thoroughly enjoyed their great services and amenities.  I also recommend treating yourself to a massage at the spa. The only down side was we sometimes felt like people were looking at us like we belonged at the Red Roof Inn, but hey, we're rookies!",5
1316,"Tea review only: I have been here 5+ times for tea. A couple times for birthdays, just by myself to catch up reading and tea, and a couple other time in between. I have never really had a bad experience (do not order a bloody mary though). The sandwiches are the best by far of any of the places to have tea in Chicago....the pastries are also equally as wonder. The hotel is not actually a Ritz-Carlton which is why it comes up a bit short....service has always been kind and attentive. They do not pour your tea for you or wait on you hand and foot but it is enough. I cannot wait until they re-open in May",4
1317,"I spent my birthday weekend in Chicago and at a friends suggestion we staid at the Ritz.  The location is amazing, right across the street from the water tower.  The staff was perfectly helpful and the room was immaculate, perhaps the decore was a bit dated.  Marie Antoinette would have felt right at home.  I asked a friend who went along in what style the room was decorated and he jokingly said it was ""Mormon temple"" On a better note the Sunday brunch is not to be missed.  A bit pricy, but with a breakfast cocktail included and everything from prime rib to an amazing raw seafood bar, to full service sushi it is perfect for a special occasion.  Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely stay at the Ritz again.",4
1318,"Very swift and easy check in with the warmth and respect that you expect from the four seasons and Ritz Carlton.  The gym is great, plenty of equipment and peppermint infused towels to help you cool down after.  The concierge is fantastic and was quick to find us a great dinner spot as well as a place to have a few drinks for a casual lunch.  Great view of Navy Pier and the lake from the room.  Comfortable sheets that feel great to snuggle up in.",5
1319,"One of my favorite Chicago hotels, with gorgeous rooms, food, and views...I'm always happy when I'm working on a project that gets set-up in their spacious conference rooms.  Attentive and lovely staff.  Can't wait to return!",4
1320,"With the name ""Ritz Carlton,"" you enter this place with certain expectations. And I'm talking HIGH expectations. This was definitely not the case. My first impression basically sums up my experience here. My friend had picked me up at the airport and dropped me off because A) she's an awesome friend and B) I had just had knee surgery and had a full-leg brace and crutches and could barely walk, let alone manage my things. As we pull up to the hotel, NEITHER of the TWO BELLHOPS took one step towards us. Even after seeing me struggle to get out of the car, after watching me wrestle with my luggage (4 bags), and even after making eye contact with me, they didn't even flinch from their spots. I had to call them over before one of them reluctantly (and I could see it on his face) mosied his way towards me. MOSY?!? I can barely hold my purse and manage my crutches at the same time and this guy is MOSY-ING? It gets worse. He then proceeds to not say one word to us...no greeting, not apologies, nothing...and takes only ONE BAG! Did I mention I had FOUR? Before I could ask him to take the others, he was gone. In effort to keep this somewhat brief, let me list off the other terrible attributes of the stay: 1) after complaining to the front desk about the bellhop as I was checking in, she just stared at me blankly and gave a half-hearted apology. Nothing else was done. No comps, no speaking with the manager, nothing. 2) when checking in, she told me she no longer had king beds available and I would have to take a room with two doubles. That would be fine if I didn't have to sleep with a GIGANTIC BRACE on my leg with my husband next to me. Being that it was a romantic getaway, sleeping in separate beds was not the suggestion I wanted to hear from the front desk. 3) Although they moved us to a king room the next night, the second room had a constant yet intermittent rattle that would sound like someone knocking on our door. All. Throughout. The. Night. 4) They erroneously charged us for mini-bar items TWICE! Once upon checkout and then again when I just happened to check my credit card!!! What if I hadn't? I would've never known. 5) Lastly, when I called the front desk to challenge said mini-bar charge, they stated they would have someone from finance call me back. It has been over a week and I had to call them back myself. Never again will I stay at a Ritz Carlton. Not what I would've expected from such a reputable hotel. Truly disappointing and a waste of my money.",1
1321,"Everything you expect from a high end hotel! The Ritz Carlton is set in a terrific location. Pros: -Awesome location. -Beautiful large room with plenty of storage (coat size closet, dresser, two drawer night stands). -Beautiful room with great views! -The service was impeccable! My husband was even impressed they everyone pronounced his polish last name correctly! -Room Service-prompt and served on a table/cart. -Comfortable bed, great dark shades, and the halls were very quiet. -The bar downstairs was reasonably priced for Chicago. The drinks downstairs with the views were worth it! Cons: My husband's only complaint was that you could not set the fan to continuously run as he prefers the white noise while sleeping.",5
1322,"From the moment we arrived, the reception staff at the Ritz were eager to please (and it didn't seem to matter I scored a discount deal on the room through expedia!). We were upgraded to a deluxe room for free, and within minutes of checking in, we scored a reservation at RL thanks to the very welcoming staff at reception. The concierge enlightened us on Chicago's must-see attractions and nighttime hotspots; she made us a dinner reservation at Mercadito and even arranged for a complimentary appetizer for our party, which was a welcome surprise as we were seated at our table later that night. Our room was sparkling on arrival and the housekeeping staff made sure to keep it that way throughout our stay. Overall great experience.",4
1323,"We went to the little bar upstairs here for a drink and the bartenders were very nice to us- coming over and giving us a ton of free nuts and olive appetizers to go down with our drinks.  Sure the drinks are expensive, but for the Ritz they are actually pretty reasonable.  I think a beer is like $6.  The building is very cool, it's older but nice.  We were able to sit on a cozy little couch and enjoy our drinks.",4
1324,"the best service EVER. i had my birthday ""coming out"" party here and the attendants were phenomenal. l'occitane products, fantastic rooms, jaw-dropping interior design in the grand ballroom and in the lobby of the hotel. very pricey but not at all a detriment. you get what you pay for. the reason why i give it only 4 stars though is because the event-coordinator of the hotel was implying that there was something minutely wrong that most of my guests were of a certain discent which i found very very offensive. i know his point, that the ritz is this prostigious place.. pretty much wasp and probably never experienced this kind of event with so many, let's say, asians that weren't all so neatly groomed. but they were my family so i didn't believe it was right to question it- my parents paid twp arms and two legs for the hotel's ballroom services and we weren't disrupting the hotel in any way. he could have at least acted like it was alright. sheesh. and what's with the pool? just a lap pool? for a 5 star hotel i was expecting at least a nicer recreation type pool.",4
1325,"I always wondered what is so special about Ritz Carlton until I happen to stay there. As far as location is concerned, this particular Ritz is located in close proximity to the finest dining and shopping boutiques of Chicago.   As soon as I entered the hotel I was greeted by staff member who escorted me to the main lobby. The lobby has marble floors, thick carpet, lots of pillars, a fountain and chandeliers which gives it a very grand look. After the check in with friendly staff i headed to my rooms. The bedroom had dark colors like most of the European hotels with colonial style furniture giving a very majestic appeal. My bed room had view of the art museum and park across the street I received exceptional service during my 2 weeks of stay. They offer complimentary shoe shine everyday .I gave my clothes for laundry one morning and upon my return, I found two cane baskets on the bed with Ritz Carlton wax paper. My first thoughts were, hot fresh bread but when I opened it, it was my laundry, ironed and folded. I was totally blown away. they have a pretty decent gym/work out room with very courteous staff. they even provide Personal trainer service upon request. the locker room is even better than a country club with mahogany lockers, wool carpets and leather chairs. Honestly, I have never seen a locker room so nice. All in all, i was impressed by the personal attention i got . the hotel staff was extremely observant and seemed like the policy was never let the customer ask for it twice. Every evening upon return i use to find bottle water by my bed side, favorite music playing and bath robe placed on the bed. Perfect way to unwind after a long day. Not to mention having a cab ready at 8am sharp with out asking. As i mentioned, all the hotel staff is very attentive.",5
1326,"I have to say I'm oddly fascinated by hotel bars.   I've never stayed at this hotel but always find a way to visit the Ritz  in whatever city I can.  My favorite thing to do is sit at the bar and order a Kir royal while I read the New York times and discuss current events with the bartender.  The Ritz here in Chicago is not bad- the lobby is large and spacious with a beautiful fountain which nicely drowns out the noise of your neighbor so you can relax.  The bar is located in the open atrium portion of the building so you get plenty of natural light which is fantastic.  The service, as you may have guessed-this is the Ritz, is exceptional.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because I've been to the Ritz in New York and it is my favorite.  Take yourself there on a Sunday afternoon and relax...",3
1327,Just celebrated my sisters wedding here and spent a few days with my husband on the 18th floor. The wedding and reception was lovely. But our room was tiny and had v ery little warm water so taking showers was uncormfortable. I've stayed 5 times but the quality has really gone downhill. I reccomend the westin instead.,3
1328,"I spent 2 luxurious nights here and I feel a bit odd giving a place like it less than 5 stars. But I have no choice when comparing my experience relative to my high expectations. To begin with, this particular Ritz can't seem to decide whether it's Pottery Barn or Roarin' 20s. Every time I walked from the 1920s bedroom area to the ultramodern bathroom it was like being sucked through a magical time warp. And yet, it took me literally 10 very annoying minutes to figure out how the ""ultramodern"" bathroom's shower worked because the valve's settings were all screwed up. And as for the 1920s aspect of the decor... it's just not my thing. I wouldn't downgrade the hotel by one star just because of that, but I'm just not a fan of the World War I era feel when I have the privilege of spending a few nights in the heart of downtown Chicago (which has quickly become one of my favorite cities in America, by the way). No other complaints whatsoever. The rooms are spacious. The views from my windows were awesome as they included both downtown and part of the lake. The service is top notch. The hotel is so fully-staffed that you can't walk 10 feet without finding someone to help you, which is nice because the hotel is so massive. I ate a few meals over 2 days inside the hotel and they were good (not excellent, but good). The location is of course perfect, if you want to be in the heart of downtown. The closest train stop, which I was adventurous enough to use to arrive from O'Hare, is barely 3 blocks away.",4
1329,"I had the pleasure to eat at the Ritz-Carlton last Sunday for their annual bridal luncheon and fashion show...it was fabulous to say the least.  The service was exceptional, very elegant atmosphere and the food was great.  I had saute of rock shrimp served with parmesan gnocchi, yukon gold potato & black truffle emulsion and roasted four story hill famr chicken served with braised kale and cippolini onions, wild mushrooms & red wine chicken jus.",4
1330,"This classic five-star hotel is located in the highrise portion of the modern Water Tower Place complex. If you have the money, stay here and be in the heart of the Magnificent Mile in a swanky hotel room.",5
1331,"I had the pleasure of staying here for a work function.  The place lives up to all you would expect for a Ritz.  The staff are super friendly, the rooms decorated well and comfortably outfitted.  The price was not too bad but that might be because i got a corporate rate.  If you are heading to Chicago ...check them out!",5
1332,"I was thoroughly impressed with a recent business conference at The Ritz.   The banquet staff were plentiful and professional.  They fed us constantly - from a breakfast buffet in the morning, cheeses and fruits at snack time, buffet lunch, afternoon sweets and popcorn, and a buffet dinner.  The bars at dinnertime were outfitted with top shelf liquor.  The minute you put down an empty plate it was whisked away as if by magic.  The conference room for daytime meetings was transformed into a dining room and stage for the evening festivities.  Bravo, Ritz.",5
1333,"I proudly was a resident of this amaaaaaaaaazing hotel when I was 7/8!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I looked out of the windows upstairs with a big expression on my face like...""I want to be here forever."" I was so spoiled for the rest of my life thinking I could walk out with everything at my fingertips in the hotel and go outside to the lake, the malls, the big museums, the Shed, etc. my parents used to get me books so i could read as i looked at the snow falling outside! It was a dream! I dreamed of this place the moment my parents made me go back to the crappy quiet IL area I was from - all right it was a nice town but just not my bag, baby, as Austin Powers might say - and from this point on, I knew that while my parents chose a different life, I was going to become a working child at 12 so I would never again have to leave my favorite Midwestern metropolis. I certainly made that true when I began working in journalism and running around Springfield and Chicaboomboomwow town at 14 for work. Was it all due to this experience? Nah probably not, but the pampering love I found here lingered in my heart and still does. I remember being treated so well when I was a kid. I know before that, I had gone up with my parents when I was 6 as I remember my dad taking me to watch Aladdin at the theater just across the block at the Water Tower, followed by getting me the little genie kit at the mall. I know I was up here back and forth. I miss it. I'm sorry, I know this whole thing sounds idiotic, but when people are so nice to you, the hotel you're lingering around forever has great food....great views....everything you could ever dream of as a little kid up til now.....I wish I could live here but my career choice wouldn't allow it.... ;( I can't stick around in IL if I want to be a mega successful chef/editorial model......",5
1334,"my church just had their benefit at the Ritz and i have to say - the Ritz staff was fantastic.  never had my wineglass been refilled so quickly nor so discreetly.  they handled late arrivals with calmness and alacrity; they navigated narrow spaces without a single spill and they switched out courses with a minimum of fuss and noise.  (hear that, hilton??  minimum of fuss and noise!) the dinner last night was really good; they had a potato gratin 'cake' that was so yummy, the folks at my table wanted to call for more.  the meal, and wine selection, was well above the standard rubbery chicken/steamed vegetable fare at other hotels in the city. (hear that, hilton?) i've also been here for the annual planned parenthood gala and it's a similar story - great staff, wonderful menu, nice wine and just really good event planning.  Ritz events really flow and their staff make an effort to make sure visitors have nothing to worry about.",5

The nicest part was the hotel had a special toy for our son and provided us with a care package for him that had baby lotions, wipes, diapers, etc.  Beautiful hotel and we will stay here again when we return to Chicago.",5
1337,The service wasn't really up to the Ritz Carlton standard in my opinion. Could have been that I didn't stay there long enough... I don't know. It is in a great location right in water tower center. The hotel is in desperate need of being updated. It is like 1980 in the lobby and conference center. My room was updated and a lake view room which I liked but it was somewhat smaller than my room at the Four Seasons in Chicago. Overall I liked the Four Seasons in Chicago a lot better and would stay there over the Ritz Carlton. I know they are owned by the same company but the Four Seasons is totally updated and I liked it a lot better.,2
1338,Love having tea here.,4
1339,"Good: - Nice room with an good (but heavily blocked) view of the lakefront. - Chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for me in the room. - Shower was nice in that it was easy to use and didn't leak. - Comforter/blanket was just right on the warmth scale - The furniture was generally very comfortable and upscale. - Nice and plentiful pillows with soft fabric. - Clean-up staff did a great job. - Staff did a great job pointing me where to go. Bad: - Those strawberries I mentioned came with a card from a husband written to his wife.  I'm a guy, and not this husbands wife!  It was a mistake made by the hotel staff and completely unacceptable. - The elevators... there needs to be WAY more of them.  I swear I waited over 10 min. twice for an elevator.  Also, you have to go through two elevators just to get to the hotel floor you're staying on.  That's really annoying, especially since they take forever to arrive and aren't very quick to ascend/descend the floors.  Plus the elevators looked old and shabby with tacky gold stuff everywhere. - The bed was so soft, I literally awoke sunk over an inch into the matress.  I think the matress was covered with that foam stuff.  Whatever it was, it was way too soft! - The hotel staff evidently went into my room at least once a day for no real reason.  The room would have the same mess I left, but the TV would be turned and left on, playing classical music.  I don't want to walk into my room to see an energy-sucking TV playing classical music with a black screen noting only the channel number via crappy TV speakers.  That was absolutely ridiculous.  If they want to freak me out by turning music on when I didn't leave it on, they can go ahead and use the little clock stereo they include in the room!!! - Parking was ridiculously expensive and I had to use valet to park.  I don't like it when people drive my car.  It's not your regular car and it's a stick shift.  No reason for me to have to have someone else park my car... no reason at all. - Here's the kicker... a week later I needed a copy of my receipt because I lost the original.  I called and was directed to accounting.  I was asked to hold.  Then I was told I had to fax in a written request.  Excuse me?  (1) This is 2010... get an online site where I can just download a PDF of my receipt like you can do with even Motel 6 and (2) No other hotel I've ever encountered requires a written request! I stayed for a company conference.  I would never stay here personally.",2
1340,"During my stay the hotel was under renovation. Overall the service was good and the room was spacious with a great lake view....personnel most of the time attentive. The restaurant quality as it relates to price is not worth. One night the seafood was undercooked and they never took it out from the bill. Three times i had dinner there, and all three times the food  quality and dish execution was different(Good to poor). Not my first choice next time that I am in Chicago..but I would consider it as a second or third.",3
1341,"Many hotels and restaurants receive five stars, but how many live up to expectations.  The Ritz lived up to expectations and ratings in every way.  My wife and had planned on going to the Ritz to spend a romantic evening out to celebrate our fifth anniversary.  When the overnight babysitter fell through we brought our two year old with us.  Who knew the Ritz was so kid friendly?  In every way possible they did what they could to make us and our son comfortable.  When we walked in, a Radio Flyer wagon of toys was brought out to us for him to choose one.  Later that night a friend came to babysit for us while we went out to dinner.  She needed the stroller to take our son for a walk and the staff graciously retrieved the stroller from our car and brought it to our room.  The next morning, his plate for breakfast was a kid friendly one.  In every way imaginable, the Ritz made our stay as comfortable as possibly.  I wish we could afford to stay here more often.  The only criticism I would have it to be careful when ordering room service.  Its definitely beyond expensive.",5
1342,"Just had my wedding here in April (2010)... The did an AMAZING job!! Marc Kaufman is the best and our wedding was flawless and stunning!!! The new decor (they just finished the ballroom in March) is classic and very posh.... The food was beyond our vision (we're big foodies!!) and the service is the best in the city!!! We had a large wedding and we planned it in 4 Months from start to finnish and Marc was there every step of the way... He knows everything about weddings and went the extra mile for us...  The hotels rooms are brand new and they hotel staff is AMAZING with children (We have a 3 yr old ) and they brought hims snacks, toys, his own little bath robe, dvds... A great place for families to stay at... If you are going to have your wedding there you MUST book fast! they book up at least 1 year in advance, we lucked out because no one wants to get married in chicago in April..... though it was 74 and sunny on our day!!",5
1343,"I loved the location of this hotel! I loved the staff of this hotel! We had a suite, so it was spacious! I heard other guests talking about how small the regular rooms were, so I'm glad we upgraded! The bartenders were really cool at this hotel! Try the Barry White shot (rasberry kamikaze) and the cucumber mojito! Delicious! If it's raining, the bell desk will check out an umbrella for their guests!! This came out handy for us! Right by Magnificent Mile and all the cool restaurants on Rush Street! Subway is also near by!  The lake is blocks away!",5
1344,"Our stay was greatly enchanted by the staff of this hotel. The service is fabulous, the location is probably one of the best ones and the decor is pleasant. The only thing where they lose some stardom is that it is very humid. Our clothes were constantly damped and the odor in the hall of our room proved that it was humid. Also the rooms are very small and though the modern deco makes you feel like a million bucks, there is little storage place and in the bedroom and the bathroom. Last point that surprised us was that a simple coffee was charged at breakfast. The breakfast price was quite expensive and I would have thought that the coffee would come with it. Or at least not been charged for a refill. So in general, totally in love with the staff, but hotel has its ups and downs.",3
1345,"My husband and I booked the hotel through Expedia.  We were landing at O'Hare super late (like midnight) so we didn't get to the hotel until about 12:30.  When we got there we were told there was something wrong with the plumbing and they didn't have a room available for us.  They already had us set up at another hotel close by and gave us cab fare.  Not bad.  When we went back the next morning to drop off our bags we were told our room was available and they upgraded us to a junior suite. Sweet!  Everyone was super apologetic.  As my husband & I told them, it happens! The hotel is pretty close to everything.  The el is about a 6 block walk.  Quick $10 cab ride gets you to Navy Pier.  Hancock building is just a few blocks away.  The concierge is super helpful and will even call and get you reservations for a tour.  The bar has some pretty yummy food.  The drinks are a tad bit expensive but they definitely do not skimp on alcohol.   We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town.",4
1346,"My friend and I decided to use Priceline ""name your own price"" bidding war to book our recent trip to Chicago.  We bid for a 4 star deluxe hotel, but wouldn't be able to see the actual hotel chosen until our bid was accepted and paid for.   We ended up w/the Knickerbocker.  My friend and I ALWAYS murder words so to stay at a place called the Knickerbocker was priceless.  We're staying at The Kinkyfker. The Redenbacher. The Betty Crocker. Mutherfker. We looked at how much the room would've been had we booked w/them straight up.  We saved more than half the price.  Hands over our mouths we were like ohhhhhhhhhh y'all just got priceliiiiiiiiiiiiiined!! Joke was on us, though.  We believe the hotel puts the pre-paid priceline guests in the worst rooms ever.  Right at about 4 in the morning, we awoke to the sounds of rumbling and slamming and racket that should only be heard at a construction site or a honeymoon suite.  We called the front desk and explained the noise.  They responded with, ""Oh, that's odd.  We'll investigate and see what's going on."" We never got a call back.  So we investigated ourselves.  Turns out our room was RIGHT next door to the service elevators (hidden by a door that says ""empoyees only"" or some sht like that). At any rate, we were rarely in our room because Chicago brought out the rockstars in us so we pretty much just used the room to bathe and change.  2 things to note about their bathroom: 1.  Rain shower head.  Finally, my chance to reenact a music video of some girl w/long hair under falling rain.  But the water pressure was too light, so it took longer to get the shampoo out.  And I wasn't used to the soapy water all up on my face.  So much for that.   2.  Dual-flush toilet.  Designed to save water.  A button for number 1, a button for number 2.  Great.  But their toilet was hella high off the ground.  My friend was getting tired of giving me a boost. 2 stars mutherfkers.  2 stars.",2
1347,"The location is great! Right off of Michigan and within walking distance of everything. You are close to Lake Michigan, shopping, dining, etc. The rooms are small but while on vacation, you are supposed to be out on the town! :)  The hotel staff is extremely friendly and responds promptly to requests.   Parking is expensive no matter where you go so if you don't absolutely need to rent a car, don't.  From O'hare, the cab fair is about $40.  In the city, you can walk everywhere, take the Ele train, or city cabs.",4
1348,"We had a great stay here and the price was very reasonable. We stayed for 4 days/3 nights on the weekend. The room was always clean and the bed was so comfortable. The shower with the waterfall and detachable spray-head were great! Our concierge Sheryl W. was an absolute pleasure! She got us reservations and wonderful restaurants that we all enjoyed. All 6 of us guys and gals really enjoyed ourselves! The two bartenders are a kick! Be sure and call ""Floyd"" by his psuedo name ""RICO!"" (As in Rico Suave)! This place was located in a great part of Chicago. We practically walked everywhere! Even to the Shedd's Sea Aquarium! I highly recommend staying here on your next visit.",4
1349,"This is a really nice golden-age hotel on the waterfront. I have to say, I didn't explore the dance floor, but the room had one of the best hotel beds.... I suppose you come to expect all-down bedding and an ultra-plush pillowtop mattress from a hotel at this level, but it was like sleeping in a cloud. The mini bar was stocked with the good stuff, including Bombay Sapphire (my personal fave). Classy bar, classy mirrored elevator.... smallish reception desk. I think people need to give the hotel a break.... it was built before swimming pools were common. My one prob with the hotel room was the bathroom. It did not have a tub, but a walk-in glass walled shower. So there was no way to have a bubble bath, first off. Secondly, the glass sCrEeched! When the door was closed, as it was glass-on-glass. Needless to say, since there was no seal, water leaked onto the bathroom floor. The other problem was the rain shower. You could only turn on the water and adjust the temperature while standing next to the hand held spigot ... right under the rain showerhead!! So.... you are forced to endure a few seconds of cold water from the shower head (even my attempts to squeeze into a corner of the shower stall did not spare me) as you switch from the handheld to the shower head. BAD design... I also had gotten the Groupon for $89 and spent Valentine's evening here, and I admit I might be giving it three stars if I'd paid full retail price. However, with the discount, the big bed, the cleanliness, and the super location, I am satisfied.",4
1350,"Good: Location, clean. Bad: Very small room.",3
1351,"We had our wedding here.  I loved it.  The venue was fantastic and our coordinator was great.  All of our guests were impressed with everything.  The food was fantastic, the timing was great for everything, and the dancefloor was unforgetable.  All of the guests at the hotel seemed happy with their rooms.  I would recommend this venue to others.",5
1352,"I was quite disappointed with this hotel.  You are paying entirely for the location (which is admittedly wonderful, sitting just off Michigan Ave), however the amenities are sadly lacking and the rooms are tiny. We had a standard room, which regularly goes for $190/night (although we had a Goupon for $89).  The room was spartan and small - the king size bed taking up nearly the entire floor space.  The bathroom has a tiny, uncomfortable toilet and the sliding door, while stylish, provides no privacy or sound dampening (hope you enjoy hearing everyone do their business).  The bed itself, however, was quite comfortable. If you forget anything (toothbrush, toothpaste, etc), the hotel has you covered - for prices that would make the mafia proud.  No complimentary toiletry items here, but you can buy a toothbrush for $5 or toothpaste for $8 from the minibar.  WiFi is $10 per day, which I found to be rather ridiculous.  Free WiFi is standard these days in almost every coffee shop, yet at $200 hotel it is extra? I expect far more from a supposedly higher-end place.",2
1353,"This is a nice old hotel right off Michigan Ave and very close to the lake. I booked my stay here while a 20% off special was running, it came to about $150/night for the middle of the week. While that is a good rate I believe for a hotel in the area, what you realize when you get there is that a lot of the incidental, parking etc. are pretty outrageous. Valet parking was $55/night. I needed a roll on bed added to my room, in most hotels I've stayed in this has been for free but they charged $20/night for this too. In many ways this hotel is the bastard cousin of the Drake, right across the street. Don't expect it to be quite as glamorous or classy, but ofcourse you get what you pay for. Also the location is smack in the middle of the ""Vi-tri"" (Viagra triangle) in Chicago. Basically a lot of old dudes hanging out at the steakhouses and bars in the area. If you're not an old dude you'll want to get out of the area pronto! In summary, good hotel, great location, friendly staff, just don't come here expecting it to be the Drake!",4
1354,"This hotel was okay but not fantastic.  I was expecting it to be a lot like the Drake (which is directly across the street) because they were both built in the golden age.  But, believe me, it isn't anything like the Drake!   My best friend and I were in town for the Shamrock Shuffle.  We first checked in and walked into a smelly smokey room.  I went to go open up the window to get some fresh air circulating...well that's why it smelled like smoke.  There were cigarette butts in the window sill!  We went downstairs on our way out to tell them (I also took a pic with my phone and showed them as well) as I didn't want to be charged anything for the smokey smell thinking it was us who left the smell.  The receptionist apologized and said she would let a manager know but that was all the communcation that was made.  I would've thought a manager would've at least contacted me or something.   When going to take a shower, watch out!  You either have too much water pressure from the shower wand or not enough from the shower head in the ceiling.  I, got blasted in the face from the shower wand.  You apprently have to have a engineering degree to use the shower!   About the only positive of the hotel was David the bartender downstairs.  He was funny and hospitable.  Go see him! Overall, not a great Chicago hotel.  Will definetly find somewhere else to stay next time! Location was great though!",3
1355,"Here is everything wrong with the hotel, since I don't really want to take up that much time.  The rooms are small, we had one of the bigger rooms and it was still very small.  The workers were very very rude.  No matter how friendly they were trying to be, you could easily read their disdain in their reactions.  We were locked out of our room at one point because the hostess didn't charge us the entire safety deposit for our stay and required us to come back down.  She was very rude and didn't seem to understand us when we did.  The pillows smelled like mold, the elevator felt like it would break down at any minute, and the shower door wouldn't stay closed totally.  After we checked out, I realized I lost my house keys, so I called back and asked if they had them.  They called back quickly and told me they had found them and I could get them at the front desk at anytime.  We were at Shedd Aquarium at the time, so we came a few hours later.  When I asked they said they didn't have them and had to check the room again.  I sat for close to 15 minutes before they finally said they had them at the desk.  The doormen were very nice but I would never stay here again.",2
1356,"Why is wifi $10 a day? Taco Bell has free wifi these days. The bathroom layout was inconvenient, and the air conditioner sucked. We couldn't get the room cold. These are the types of things that a cheaper hotel does right. The location was great and it was safe and clean.",2
1357,"Our suite at the Knickerbocker is quite nice, but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. First, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present.  Not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""What do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. Fast forward to this evening.  Following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. Acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume.  On one hand I appreciated his honesty, but on the other, I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. Since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. Also, I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property.  This wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. Would I stay here again?  Maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill.  Yet I've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense.",1
1358,"We went for a quick last minute  weekend anniversary get away and wanted somewhere nice but not too expensive. I found this place on http://hotels.com and it was the cheapest on a Friday ( considering it was a holiday weekend) and looked decent , and was across from the drake close to all the touristy things to do in Chicago. The downside is that we drove from Milwaukee and parking in Chicago is atrocious enough as it is but the hotels valet service costs $50-ish bucks and I was not happy about that. The good thing is there is a parking garage LITERALLY across the street that is only $35.. you can't take your car in and out though and that's only for 24 hours. SO we did that, problem solved. Deets on the Digs: Presumably re-vamped recently, outside of the rooms were kinda run down, I don't know if they pay attention to these things but door frames and floor boards were filthy and in need of a good coat of paint. The elevator was terrifying. I mean, talk about a death box. I am claustrophobic enough as it is but I could barely move with all our luggage. I overlooked these things because of the price and location and then get into the room and it is small but very luxurious. I read others reviews here about the showers and laughed because there's instructions IN the shower on how to use them and I have to say I don't think I've taken that many showers in a 24 hour period, ever. I loved it. The marble in the bathroom echoed and it kinda made me self conscious about using the loo considering you could hear everything. I would suggest some kind of better rug or something in there that would muffle the noise. Also the toilet was confusing, The flusher was on the wall above the toilet and has two buttons that do the same thing. I guess it's a ""fancy"" thing I don't understand but I thought it was unnecessary The bed was AMAZING.. if not for the fact that we wanted to sight see I would have stayed in and slept. I was so comfortable in fact I passed out as soon as my head hit the pillow. Our bed at home is now an utter disappointment. We ordered room service twice and I have to say it was quiet reasonable. We split pancakes in the morning and they were delicious. My boy got late night cheesecake the night before and because they were missing an ingredient they gave us two pieces! Quite nice. Overall, knowing the small discrepancies here and there I would definitely stay there again.",4
1359,"Welcome all to another edition of ""Johnny Asks..."" So Johnny asked ""what hotels are good but cheap for a secret getaway?"" (eyebrow notched) Why do you ask JT?! Have some secrets do you?! Are you asking me on secret getaway!?! Listen, I like you and all Johnny but I'm already in a relationship, you understand, right? Anyways, you could go to the MKH. Not the best hotel in the city but the price is fair, the rooms are not huge but enough (awesome pillows and super comfy bed which is the most important, right?!), service is average, great location in the city, they host a murder mystery dinner on the top floor, and they have a descent bar in the lobby of which you can order some bar food too. Their bartenders are hilarious and make a fierce drink. They do have complimentary bar snacks but honestly why would you eat them?! Do you know how many hands have been in there?! So I only stayed one night after watching the murder mystery dinner. I don't recommend the mystery dinner (I'll explain later). I hope this helps, sounds like you're up to know good again JT!!",3
1360,Great location!  Staff is helpful too many Priceliners including myself... You can't beat $108 a night on Michigan Avenue... Bump up to a suite for an additional $50 a night.  I prefer the Intercontinnental and of course the Elysian( recently became Waldorf Astoria) but they'll set you back!,4
1361,"Came to Chicago for a two day meeting and I barely left the hotel. The service was attentive, the food they brought in for many of my meals was good, when I was able to find a veggie option.  Imagine my surprise when two traditional veggie-friendly soups, minestrone and pasta fagioli, had meat in them. The bar was nice, but not separate from the lobby and I prefer a separate room for my hotel bar.  However, the bar at the Drake Hotel across the street is excellent. Many people would like the location as it is so close to many popular areas of Chicago; shopping, Lincoln Park, Zoo, the loop.  Personally, i found it a little soulless.  While the location is a huge plus for many, I do prefer a less glitzy, and more neighborhoody, area. Overall, a good, clean 2 day stay.",3
1362,I had a lovely three night stay here. Location is right by Michigan with all the designer shops. Service was top notch and efficient. We had the one bedroom suite which came with a living room. The bathrooms have this jet tub thing plus a rain shower. Plus I love the turndown service where they come in and turn down the sheets and leave chocolates on your bedside table. All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and always greeted us. My only complaint would be it was a little hard to control the temperature setting in our room (it was either a bit too cold or too warm). I would definitely stay here again.,5
1363,"We were able to get a great deal travelocity so this is a nice hotel than we can usually afford. It's in a great location right at the end of Magnificent Mile, and perfect for bus rides to the downtown area, as well as Wicker & Lincoln Park. The staff and door men are very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are beautifully decorated with classic B&W photography and comfortable which a flat screen tv and complimentary coffee. The bathroom is really beautiful and the rainfall shower is AMAZING! i wanted to shower three times a day! another nice feature is that the elevators respond very quickly and are a good size for such an old building. and there are three of them so it was really easy to get to and from our 7th floor room. ice machines are only on three floors so we got lucky that one is on the 7th.",5
1364,"One of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in....  amazing sheets, and perfectly padded for your comfort. The showers are also pretty neato too. Not only do you have a rainfall shower on top, but you also have the handheld shower that is propped up on the side, and that my friends, is nothing short of awesome. OH, and if you have room service in the morning, get the french toast with bananas.  And, get a side of bacon.  This is best if you eat it in bed. It's sexy trust me :)",4
1365,"We stayed here for 3 nights.  Great location as it's right off Michigan Avenue that you can easily walk to all the shops.  If you don't care for the hotel amenities, then this is is a decent place to stay. We were on the 10th floor, but right near the elevator which was annoying at times because we could hear people talking.  The room was smaller than expected, but I liked the modern decor and the 42"" TV which was the biggest I've seen in a standard hotel room.   Bathroom was clean and up-to-date with a rain shower, but the toilet was surprisingly too high for me that it was a little uncomfortable.  The coffee and the coffeemaker were cheap and terrible for this hotel.  I think they need to upgrade both.   Internet was $9.95 a day, but we opted out as we did ourselves a favor by not doing any work.  From our window, we were able to see a glimpse of Lake Michigan.  Overall, a decent hotel.",4
1366,I enjoyed my stay here in the perfect location by the Hancock Tower and just off the Magnificent Mile. Rooms were very clean and comfortable and there is a grand old-fashioned lobby to enjoy a cocktail or post-shop cup of coffee. It's an easy walk to the beach and all the great sights of this historical city. I found the rate very competitive too. But the very best thing about this hotel? The grilled cheese and tomato soup! The best I have had anywhere and available on the room service menu.,4
1367,"As a frequent visitor to the the big city, I have stayed in a LOT of hotels mostly all through priceline bids and Groupons/Living Social deals. This one failed to measure up in too many ways for me to return. I went up with a group this trip and we didn't request rooms near each other, they did offer us adjoining rooms so that was very nice except they never sent anyone up to unlock the interior door so we just swapped a key and had to go in and out in the hall. Not too big of a deal but maybe annoying for the rooms next to us hearing the doors slam over and over. The elevators were tiny and although there were 3 one was broken with the door stuck half open. I will agree the bathrooms have zero privacy with every sound clearly coming into the room. No-name shampoo/conditioner and soap was pretty boring. Was also sad about the $10/day wi-fi and I don't know how they can continue that $50/day parking when there are 2 lots within 5 minutes of them that are $25 and $30/day. The valet parking does have unlimited in and out while the other lots do not. We wanted to have a drink in the lobby hotel when we got back from our nightly entertainment but when we walked up they were removing the bottles of alcohol and storing them away for the night. As we stood there discussing if we wanted to try walking elsewhere, a lady came up and ordered a vodka tonic with lemon. He made a tonic with lemon instead of telling her they were closed so then when she tried to pay and he said No charge, she got all confused (this wasn't her first vodka tonic!) and kept demanding they add vodka. He was telling her to go to her room and add it from the mini bar but I think if he would've just said we are closed, I can give you the mixer and you add the vodka, right from the beginning, there would've been less of a scene. Also, in the morning as we came down on our way to breakfast, we stopped for 4 coffees to drink on the way and it was over $20. For 4 black coffees, no lattes, no espressos, just drip brew flavored water. Didn't guess that was the average price or we would've waited until breakfast! I wouldn't buy another discount deal for this place but if I won it on Priceline, I guess it would do.",2
1368,"I feel like this hotel should be rated much better in hotel class and overall rating than it is. I think very little credit is given where it's due because this is quite a nice place to stay. It has a fantastic location, the rooms are comfortably roomy for a city hotel and the price is literally just right. I was here for a week and I felt absolutely comfortable and happy to stay here. The room service was impeccable and very consistent, the bed was ultra comfortable, the showers were pretty awesome. The only complaint is that their toilets are so high off the ground. You know what I'm talking about ... The staff is friendly, the lobby is small but cozy. The bar at the lobby is nice and they have free wifi in the lobby. The bell men take extra good care of your bags when you need help or to check them in and I only paid a small price for being right around the corner from Louis Vuitton and Gucci every, single, day. I should take that back, I actually ended up losing 90% of my wallet contents inside LV since I saw it every day, day in and day out while I was there, but that's another story. I recommend this as a steps away place to Michigan Ave and a fantastically priced, well located, well amenitie'd hotel in the heart of Chicago.",4
1369,"I had a terrible experience with the Knickerbocker hotel and would never go back: my computer was stolen from the room I was staying in.  The hotel fought me for weeks on not having to reimburse me in full for a $2,000 computer, and tried to hide behind some Illinois' inn keeper law and tried to only reimburse me $500.   Knickerbocker: go read a book on the Four Season's up the street at Borders and take some tips on customer service.",1
1370,"The location was great and the rooms were fine; the bathroom was great in fact. In terms of customer service, however, it failed miserably for me and my students. I was there with 6 students of mine for a field trip to visit art museums. So as a group, we checked out 5 rooms. First of all, the hotel had a $75 authorization charge per night per room which I never had to deal with before, and it was something the hotel didn't inform us about when booking the room. For some of the students, depending on the bank, the funds will not be released for 3-5 business days. Problems: 1. When checking out, the bill that was slipped under the door noted that I had stayed there for one night (which was wrong since I had stayed there for two nights) and that I owed them for that night. Again, not true since the room was paid in full in advance. 2. The day after we arrive back home, a student of mine notifies me that her bank account had a $368 dollar charge from the hotel. First of all, it was only supposed to have been a $150 authorization. So when I called the hotel, I was informed that it was a mistake and they have no idea why the person checking her in did that. !!!?? How do you not know how to type in 150 and instead type in 368? So that is 200 dollars that this student won't have access to immediately, not to say she already had 150 dollars that she wouldn't have had access to. Pretty bad.",3
1371,"This hotel is my new go-to for Chicago.  Not expensive BUT spacious and well appointed.  This location is right off the lake and VERY close to Michigan Avenue shopping etc.  This location is FAB if you want to see the city The bar downstairs was SO much fun AND they have a jazz trio there on the weekends that really gets people in a good mood. The room had a ginat comfortable bed, closet and a SAFE (I saw that one reviewer said their computer was stolen - SO you should put your computer etc in there just to be safe because you never know) Now onto the front desk because THIS is why they lose a star with me.  They said they would authorize my debit card for incidentals at $75 per day. Instead, they authorized $15o per day (double what they said they would).  That was CRAZY, when I called them, they said the ""authorization"" was just a hold and would fall off after 48 hours since nothing was used.  I take issue with this because hotels routinely hold your money whether you are using it for incidentals or not.  There should be an option to block incidentals.",4
1372,"As with most http://Hotwire.com deals, we reserved a room and found out upon checking in that it was, indeed, a king-sized bed to be shared between four people. Aside from the cramped arrangements, the hotel was excellent. The hotel bar was expensive (as is anything in the Loop), and the ceilings were pretty low. My only other gripe was that the door to the bathroom was a sliding door, and left a rather large and awkward open space between the panel and the wall. Other than that, the room and hotel itself were very nice, and the location was excellent - right across the street from The Drake and footsteps from Michigan Avenue.",4
1373,"Nice jumping-off spot to go shopping on the mag mile. Our room was fairly big for a city hotel.  People working there were really friendly.   They're currently charging $55 for valet parking, but you can find cheaper (like $29 for 24 hrs) if you're willing to walk a block. Note:  For this hotel ""Millennium"" refers to the hotel chain, not that it is near Millennium Park.  It is in the touristy Streeterville/Gold Coast/North Michigan Ave. shopping area.",4
1374,"Came here for an evening of downtown Chicago festivities and this was a great stay.   It certainly has that European feel, which to some, can just mean plain small.  We got a basic room but you can upgrade for more space for a small fee of about $15-20.  Learn your square footage for bookings these days so you know what questions to ask! Anyway, I don't mind small, especially since it way only overnight. There were drawers for your stuff and a decent closet so you can get a lot of stuff out of the way if you want.  If I was staying for a week or something, I'd get the bigger room. Doors are pocket doors so they don't get in the way. With that said, there's an awkward gap on the bathroom door that if the person in the room is sitting at just the right angle, they can see a bit of your reflection in the bathroom mirror, even though the door is closed.  Hard to explain, but just be aware that if you do ""private"" things in the bathroom you wouldn't want others to see, keep this caveat in mind. Super quiet sleeping, very nice linens, huge TV, stocked mini-fridge.  I felt their customer service was fantastic.  Front desk was professional and very quick, and the doorman was kind enough the brush the snow of my dirty filthy car while we retrieved our bags.   One problem:  for late night snacks, there's not much around. The only place open within a block was Cheesecake Factory, and I wasn't going there.  Ended up going to Tempo, where there was a nice mix of people out late at night for a variety of reasons that I always find myself wondering....",4
1375,"don't be fooled by the age of the lobby, front desk, and elevators, because those are misrepresentations of the rooms! rooms are newly renovated with modern decor.  nice flat screen plasma in every room.  the rooms are not big, but not small and claustrophobia inducing.   restroom came with rain shower, hand held shower, as well as every hotel's must:  hairdryer.  well-lit and clean!   friendly staff and great service.  i would highly recommend the millennium knickerbocker for anyone looking for a reasonable priced place to stay :)",4
1376,"Comfortable and friendly. The Knick, good people here. Highly recommend. I have stayed here over and over the last few years. I say, the staff recognizes you after a while, and it is a very nice feeling in a big town like Chicago. I used to stay at the Talbot previously, but it changed hands, and became very corporate, inflexible and expensive, so I start going to the Knick. Its a pretty cool old hotel. Once the ""Playboy Club"", it does the job, day in and day out, as a great mid-priced downtown stay. Spotlessly clean rooms, lovely amenities, newly remodeled... absolutely no downside. Right by the beach, and right by the El, actually, just across from the Drake. Oddly, though, the bar serves up a decent Old Fashioned (ask for Steve) compared to the wretched crap at -of all places- the Elysian, or the Peninsula, which are absolute crap. (trust me on this) Knick, you are my ""go-to"" spot in Chicago. Thanks for the always nice stay Knick! Adendum;  did I mention they fill your ice bucket during turn-down service?   ...nice touch. Carry on.",4
1377,"This maybe the best hotel that I have ever visited, based on service.   First, we arrived about 3 hours before scheduled check-in and they let us into our room with no added fee.   Second, they had the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in.   Third, they had a huge shower with the rainfall spout. The room was a little small, but we were only there to sleep. Fourth, they had a couple very helpful concierges.  They made some great restaurant recommendations and were able to get us tickets to a show and give us bus/train information. Fifth, on our check-out day, we were up late the night before and got a late check-out, at no extra cost. Sixth, after our late check-out, they kept our bags at the hotel for six hours until our flight left, at no extra charge.   When it seems like some places nickel and dime you for everything, this place was a welcome relief.     Also, it is a great location, about a block from the Hancock Tower and Michigan Avenue.  If you are in town to shop, this is ground zero for upscale shops.",5
1378,"DO NOT STAY HERE. I chose the Millennium Knickerbocker for my wedding hotel block.  I chose it because the rooms were reasonably priced, the location was perfect in relation to where my reception was and the coordinator was very easy to deal with.  We signed the contract in January and that was the last good thing to happen.  Here are some highlights: -management changed and the new wedding block coordinator had no idea what was going on.  she was not timely in her response time and made everything very confusing -on the tuesday before our saturday wedding i called to confirm what time we would have access to the Burnham Suite where my soon to be husband and i were staying but where the groomsmen were also going to be getting ready on Saturday during the day - I was notified that the Suite had been given away!!!! -so the groomsmen had to get ready in a less than appealing conf room, we spent our first night being married in the same room i had stayed in on friday -it gets better -my room was not cleaned, we had arranged for champagne and a fruit tray for when we got back after the reception.  the fruit was moldy -oh and it took over 20 minutes to check-in I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE",1
1379,I loved this hotel!  The entire hotel staff was top notch...the doormen were so friendly and the service was exceptional.  This hotel was a great mix of history and modern upgrades to make it a top hotel.  The location was great for shopping and dining...would definitely stay here again.,5
1380,"Hotel Lobby Bar Project Review #8 - Martini Bar Drinking at the Knickerbocker lobby bar is like drinking in the company board room. It's not at all unpleasant but you feel like you're in that awkward little place between old-fashioned charm and new-fanged snazz. In other words, just kinda dumpy. My cohort astutely pointed out that the complimentary bar snack was the exact same cheesy pretzel mix that that have at our local VFW Hall. Plus or minus? You decide! The bartender may have been the best part of the bar. When we enquired as to what the large room was up on the mezzanine level he replied (in the friendliest way possible) that we were just looking it a series of mirrors meant to make the room look larger.  Nice trompe 'l'oeil, Knickerbocker. He was friendly, chatty and seemed slightly crestfallen when we asked for the check after only one round. Sorry Martini Bar, we have Chicago Fizzes to drink and toasted almonds to eat up the road. I think Knickerbocker might need to turn in for the evening. It's ok though, Diagnosis Murder is on followed by the evening news. Cheer up!",3
1381,"I stayed here during my visit from Boston in the early summer. My friends and I thought it looked good online and the location seemed good (well, coming from the Concierge). Watch the progression of my rating...(we'll start off with 5 stars to be fair) When we checked in, the front desk gave us a hard time about our online reservations and were quite rude. After arriving upon our room, we discovered that it was a smoking room, when we clearly requested a non-smoking room (my friend has really bad allergies). When we finally switched to another room, the view was crappy and was tiny (especially for four college girls with about two suitcases each :P) -4 stars However, the rooms were very nicely decorated and the pillows were ridiculously luxurious! +1 star Bathrooms were tiny; my closet back home is bigger (that's saying something!) For the four of us (where at least 20 minute prep time is needed before going out), this became *quite* a hassle. -2 stars We barely needed our rental car; we could walk everywhere! Location is very good, as everything was about 10 minutes away. +2 stars The restaurants in the surrounding area were yummy and we enjoyed ourselves immensely with all of the culinary delights and nightlife choices. +2 stars Parking is crazy expensive, especially when you're on a student budget like we were. Even if you parked at a nearby garage instead of having the hotel valet do it, everyday parking came to be pricey. That definitely put a dent on our spending for going out, shopping, etc. -2 stars The upstairs area and the lobby are gorgeous; chandeliers, velvet, gorgeous draping, etc. Very nice; imagine the effect it had on us the first time we stepped in! :) +1 stars So, all in all, 3 stars. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I'll probably try somewhere else.",3
1382,"This hotel is getting 3 stars mainly because of the location. Because the customer service is nothing they should be proud of - that's for sure! The room was nice enough, clean and bright but very small, as were the beds. Our bathroom door did not shut properly which was fuckin' irritating. What I want to know is how you can say you have a martini bar with 50+ martinis and not make a cucumber martini? WTF! We stayed here four nights and it wasn't that bad. We got an OK deal on Priceline. But basically I would not CHOOSE this hotel to stay at again and the MAIN reason (HOTEL MANAGERS I HOPE YOU""RE LOOKING AT THIS) is because the check-in staff and front desk staff were incredibly rude, very disorganized and generally not appearing to be that interested in customer service. These people need MAJOR MAJOR training. I had to wait over 25 minutes for them to ""find"" a package which I stood there looking and pointing at the entire time. This was especially not cool because I told them immediately when I asked for the package that I pointed to, I needed to be in my cab outside to head to an event... which I was then late to.",3
1383,"As the venue for our Law School Prom (yes, I did indeed say ""PROM""), this hotel was very average. The ballroom was beautifully done and impressive with its high ceilings and flowery viney gilt doohickeys all over (I'm sure there's an architectural term for this of which I'm just wholly ignorant). Although the '80s-/'90s-/Miami-Vice-inspired light-up dance floor was slightly incongruous with these flowery viney ceiling and wall decorations, the light-up dance floor was definitely WAY awesome when the (horrifically outdated and spectacularly BAD) DJ played ""Billie Jean,"" the highlight of my evening. Was the DJ that bad? Yes, he really was THAT bad. If I knew who he was, his review would make my Barnes & Noble review look like a feather floating in the wind. I did find it a little odd that the ballroom was a two-story setup such that there were twelve tables or so on the second floor, too. This seems like poor planning, and while it makes for a pretty room and more space for the hotel to rent out, it also makes for an inefficient means for the people seated up there to access the dance floor. ANYway, while the decor was generally pretty beautiful and slightly eclectic, I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. Granted, it was hotel food. I understand that. Unfortunately, it was reeeeeally bad hotel food. A three course meal (salad, entree, and dessert), the salad was the best of the three and that's mainly because it's probably really hard to mess up a basic salad as long as the greens are fresh. The chicken was bland and the deceptively rich-and-creamy-looking sauce was just that -- DECEIVING! The cheesecake (not on my list of favorite desserts in the first place) was oddly-textured. So disappointing. In the end, although the Drake would have apparently cost ~40% more for our tickets, I would happily have paid that amount because my experience with their food was in the past much more satisfying and the single-story layout is more conducive to cohesive group identity (i.e. being able to stumble onto the dance floor together without having to navigate any stairs).",3
1384,Staff was extremely helpful and professional. Ask the bellman for advice on where to park if you do not want to valet.  The room was on the small side but comfortable.  The lobby bar is a welcoming space.  The sheets were great.  The shower was fun.,4
1385,"I actually got the hotel on Priceline for something like $60 or whatever so I really didn't have really high expections. I read some pretty horrible reviews about this place from some of the other hotel review sites out there though so I was a little nervous.   I've actually never had a bad experience from Priceline and this was no different.  For $60 or so, this place was great.  Perfect location, friendly staff, all the basics.  The room felt like it was out of the 60s with lots of dorky decor, but who cares, right?",4
1386,"Went to the lobby bar with my cousin last night, around 1amish.  I was dressed up, and she was in her pajamas.  Was unimpressed with the round bar just sitting in the lobby, and very unimpressed with the menu that had $14 drinks.   That is when the very character-y bartender (stout black guy who has a lot to say and I approve) told me that his drinks were certainly worth it, and I'd be buzzed after one.  I have alcoholic genes, so I can drink most men under the table and never catch a buzz, but I digress. The one tasty, fruity martini got me beyond buzzed.  I was drunk.  So this yelp's to you, Mr. Bartender. I am only taking one star away because I still am unimpressed with the vibe.  But the bartender himself, gets 5 stars.  He even flirted with my shy cousin. AS FAR AS THE HOTEL ITSELF: I don't know what to say about it.  There was a swingers ball going on, and that was pretty exciting.  What kind of establishment is this?  Added to my ""hotel bar"" experience, in a cool kind of way.",4
1387,"I was attending a conference at the Drake and was a bit disappointed to learn that I had been moved over to the Knickerbocker.  My coworkers were all staying at the Drake and I was pretty sure the Knickerbocker would be a step down.  Especially when I walked into the lobby.  I wasn't expecting much, as it is far more understated than the beautiful Drake lobby.   Boy was I in for a surprise.  I soon learned that I had been booked into a suite.  When I stepped into the room, I fell in love.  It had just been remodeled with beautiful furnishings and...drum roll please...the most amazing bathroom.  Brand new, a rain shower, European fixtures and a whirlpool bath.  I'm usually not a bath person.  At all.  But this wasn't one of those scary tubs with the old, gross jets, it was a new bath with the vents in the bottom and an electronic control panel with several different settings.  It was awesome.  I want one for my house. So anyways, if you get the opportunity to stay at the Knickerbocker, jump on it.  I believe they have remodeled many of their rooms, just make sure you get one of them and you will be a happy traveler.",4
1388,"For the price ($99/night) it was great, especially for the location. Its just off Michigan Ave. where all the awesome shopping.The staff is friendly and courteous. However, this hotel is really run down. The decor is nice but obviously worn. The bathroom is like a motel 6. The shower drain was clogged so that when you showered, it would pool at your feet. eeewwww. The beds are unpleasantly lumpy and uncomfortable. But, you can't beat the price for the location. Worth repeating because it's pretty much the only thing going for it.",2
1389,"I stayed here for a conference.  It would probably not be my first choice. There are a few interesting things about this hotel - it used to be the Playboy Hotel when Playboy was headquartered in Chicago.  If you're into quirky historical places, yay.  It's also within walking distance of Carmines - another quirky historical place.  Frank Sinatra and Al Capone were regulars.  See my review of Carmine's for more info. The hotel itself is a small boutique joint.  The rooms are very small, but clean and the beds are comfortable.  The bathrooms are modern, and have rain showers as well as hand shower wands.  My room did not have a bath tub. As far as food choices at the Knickerbocker go, plan to eat elsewhere.  There is a martini bar in the lobby, but don't ask for a cucumber martini.  You'll get a blank stare.  There is a restaurant - Nix - but don't plan on dinner.  They are only open in the mornings.  Don't even plan on a late lunch there.  They close at 1.   Internet is not complimentary ($9.95/day), and there is a minimum $5 charge to use the business center.  I was also informed (incorrectly, as it turns out) that there was a charge for gym use.  Parking is valet only, and is $53/day (gulp).  There is no pool. If all you need is a comfortable bed, on a quiet street close to Miracle Mile, and you either don't need extras or don't mind paying for them,  this is a great choice for you.",3
1390,"Review only for the bar.  Staying nearby, tired, just looking for some Silver Patron, an olive flight and some chard.  $63 later, we were happy and  full.  I certainly would not make a special trip here, but I can't complain a bit. ps: The bartender, David, is one of the coolest guys ever.  I enjoyed his slightly antagonistic approach to the suits venturing forth for a glass o' merlot n' some fried pickles (very authentic, according to David)-- an actual quote we enjoyed ""Naw, we GOT Memphis here in Chicago!!!"" in response to some fool trying to say that Chicago was NOT the best midwestern city.   pps: we saw David making something that looked like a Frappuccino with a kick.  Vanilla ice cream plus some other fun stuff-- you might want to get this...",4
1391,"While I've never stayed at this hotel, as the former chair of my grad program's Winter Formal Planning Committee, I spent my fair share of time at the venue itself and interacting with the event planning staff. Throughout the planning process, they were very willing to work with us to keep the event within our budget. They also ensured that everything ran smoothly on the day of the event, from allowing our committee to show up early to do some setting up, to being ready to go with both the coat check and the bar. They were very accommodating of our large, at and times rowdy, group. Everyone loved the light up dance floor. And everyone in attendance had a good time.",4
1392,"Location location location.  That is the key.  It's across from the Drake.  It's near the 900 Shops.   My friend got married here and the staff was very knowledgeable and helpful.   The newly renovated hotel is beautiful, especially the Crystal Ballroom.  It is gorgeous! The valet can get pricey (over $25 a night).",4
1393,"They just renovated, so the rooms are pretty swanky, particularly the bathrooms.  I love the roomy showers.  The decor is very Westin-esque and I'm a fan of their free shampoo and conditioner (the brand is Gilchrist and Soames). The restaurant downstairs leaves much to be desired.  The decor is horrendous and the food was so-so (I had the shrimp scampi farfalle).   If you want a decent drink and good company (particularly after you've left your laptop in a cab, but I digress), go to the bar.  I had a manhattan and the knickerburger (verdict? delicious and fairly priced) and enjoyed good conversation with David, the bartender. Overall, the stay has been good - but spend your money somewhere else on food.",4
1394,"Stayed here for 4 nights & had a very enjoyable stay.  Check in time says it's 3pm, but we arrived a couple hours earlier & were able to check in & unwind right away.  Desk staff, doormen & bellmen were all very friendly & helpful - quick to give directions or recommend a place to grab a bite & a drink.  The hotel bar is basic, but the stools are comfortable & the bartenders are quick with a refill & a joke. The room was very small, but unless you are trying to fit more than 2 people in the room, it is fine.  The bed was not as comfortable as I would have thought, but it was OK.  The rainfall shower was nice, but the pressure wasn't too strong (use the handheld attachment if you need to get shampoo out). Would definitely return here.  I have heard people were treated differently when booking there through Hotwire or Priceline, but I received great service & would return.  They also let you print out your boarding pass for free.",4
1395,"A nice spot to park the parents when they're in town!!  Right around the corner from Watertower Place and all the Michigan Ave. fav's, this ideally located hotel has pleasant & friendly front desk and valet/door staff.   The staff was responsive to problems, for example - when my parents' window shade fell off the wall at 10pm, a maintenance guy was there within minutes.   Although their room was small, it was fancifully decorated and clean.  Their friends had a room next to the elevator which was more spacious (b/c it's handicap accessible, the bathroom is at least normal sized and not miniature). The bar isn't really separated from the lobby, it almost feels like one space.  Martinis were on par for the neighborhood ($14) and the bar had a live trio playing one evening. Parking was $44/day, almost 1/2 the room rate - ouch!  (Why do this when you have your lovely daughter who can serve as a shuttle driver between her apartment and your hotel?!)  Room rates were reasonable ($105) by calling the hotel directly, but I'm betting you could get lower by using a service like Priceline.",4
1396,"The Millenium Knickerbocker seems to be about a millenium behind the times.  Which can be good and bad. Behind the times:  size of meeting rooms, decor, internet availability ( they charge for lobby wi-fi internet access). However, sometimes a history in Chicago is a plus and a selling point.  The Knickerbocker does have some character, thought the meeting rooms tend to be small and window-less. If I were to plan a big meeting in the city, I would not choose the Knickerbocker.  However, if I were to plan a wedding, I may consider the Knickerbocker for its character and charm.  The rooms tend to be small with low ceilings, whick makes for a intimate feel...so much better for social gatherings than business gatherings.",3
1397,"I will never stay here again. My girlfriends and I came downtown for a birthday celebration and got a room for a night. I got a pretty good deal on the room with a travel site, but given the price that it should have been...not worth the money. It was less than impressive, I've stayed in nicer hotels in Cleveland. But regardless, the main reason for my rating is that they have a ton of hidden fees, and on top of it all, they charged my credit card for items from the mini-bar that I did not take. When I called to ask if there may have been a mistake, I was simply told no and that I would be charged anyways. Moral of the story, I have a hard time giving this hotel anything but one star when they cant admit their mistakes, or they are just simply ripping people off on purpose. Either way, they will never get my business again.",1
1398,"I stayed here for a couple of nights during a business trip to Chicago.  Actually our work meetings were held on premises as well.  First, I have to say that I really loved the location.  Even though downtown/miracle mile Chicago isn't my end-all and be-all of city destinations, I still appreciated that I was close to Michigan ave...especially when I had a night off to relax and enjoy some time meeting up with my transplanted Detroit friend.   (And I loved the proximity to Jamba Juice...I'm a freak, I know! but we don't have it at home, so I savor it when I encounter one!)   As for the hotel, the staff were super nice.  The rooms were great, with beautiful, modern bathrooms (I loved the rainfall shower!) and big TVs.  The decor was clean and modern but the beds did leave something to be desired...maybe it was the pillows but I definitely remember not being super comfortable.   Our work meetings were mainly held in the Crystal Ballroom, which is a beautiful space.  I can imagine how pretty it would look for an special evening event.  However, since I was in there all day for up to eight hours, I did have plenty of time how there were numerous coats of paint and plenty of wear on the carpets.... Oh, the cold, cruel light of day!   When I return to Chicago, I probably will not have this place as my first choice, more like 2nd or 3rd choice if I will be staying close to the Miracle Mile area.",3
1399,"I'll keep this one short-  decent hotel with a great location.  The prices are reasonable for a hotel right off the magnificent mile, and our room had been recently renovated, but was a bit on the small side.  The elevator was older and slow, but did the job.  The staff was friendly.  Its definitely worth considering again for a trip.",3
1400,"I work kitty corner from this hotel, so I recommend that coworkers stay here when coming in from out of town. I haven't been in the rooms, but they say they are nice and clean and fine. I have found the loby bar a nice place to stop and get a drink with colleagues after work. Service was very friendly and responsive. Haven'd dined in the restaurant, but appetizers in the bar were delicious.",4
1401,"I loved this hotel.  Stayed a total of three nights in May of 2009.  We had a one-bedroom suite, which was very clean and well-decorated.   One of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in.  The bathroom was amazing!  It had a rainfall spout shower and a tub next to it, all encased in glass.  I was very impressed by the bathroom.   They didn't have much in terms of food options, and so I'm giving it four stars.",4
1402,"We enjoyed our stay at Millenium Knickerbocker.  Staff was cordial and the place was clean.  Very pretty hotel in a great location off of the Magnificent Mile with shops and eateries close by.  Room was small but, very nice design.  Nice shower in the bathroom.  Room was very cold at night but, changed thermostat in the morning with no problem.  This hotel does put a $75 hold on credit card which I found strange.  Have not had a hotel do that before.  We did not get anything from the bar so the amount was never credited to my account but, it was annoying knowing it was a pending charge for 4 days till it was officially taken off.",3
1403,"Just returned home from a 3 night stay in a standard King room at the Millennium Knickerbocker.  I lived on Lake Shore Drive in the Streeterville area for 10 years, so I was pretty familiar with the area.  It was nice to visit my old stomping grounds and see what's changed in the area. Pros:  great location, close to everything.  A historical landmark, and right across the street from from the Drake Hotel, an even more historical Chicago landmark.  Room size is average for a downtown hotel, which means ""not very big"" - but the bed was comfortable and bathroom was nicely decorated with modern fixtures. Cons:  in the hotel's attempt to be eco-friendly, they installed modern, low-water-consumption toilets that aren't powerful enough to flush anything down but liquids - I had to call an engineer to plunge the toilet when we checked in.  Also, there was some evidence of yellowish-brown crud in the corners of the bathroom (gross).  The shower was another issue - they installed a nice ceiling mounted shower head as well as a handheld nozzle, but the shower itself (no bathtub) is very small and the glass door opens INWARD, so when you turn on the shower you either get shocked by cold water coming down from the ceiling, or you drench the door and bathroom floor if you choose to turn the shower on first and let it warm up.  Not a very smart layout. Additionally, if you have a car, valet parking is mandatory at $53/day (there's no self-parking) but that's downtown parking for you.  On the plus side, the valets are very friendly and pleasant, and are very prompt with retrieving your car when you call down for it.",3
1404,"My review is merely for the 11 hour period we were there between 10 pm and 9 am, but for what it's worth, those were good hours. We needed a rental car for the remainder of our trip, so we picked one up at O'Hare and made the drive here. Finding the hotel was pretty easy. The valet parking? I knew it was coming, and it was still painful. At least I didn't physically see the $53 charge till the next morning. The best part of this hotel, other than the clean, beautiful lines to it, is obviously the location. Just across from the Drake, you're incredibly close to so much that Chicago has to offer. Since we got there late, checking in was a breeze. We had purchased our room through Priceline and there were no problems. We were quickly sent out our way through the tiny elevators to the 9th floor, which had mostly a view of the buildings around it, but through one small opening, you could also see to the lake. Not that you can see much at 10 pm at night anyway, but I digress. The bed and linens were incredibly comfortable and I slept like a baby. The added bonus to the whole 11 hour stay was the concierge who pointed us towards an excellent breakfast just a few quick blocks away at Feast. Head there for a meal if you're staying at the Knickerbocker. You won't be disappointed.",4
1405,"It's been two years now and slowly....I'm becoming an expert on downtown Chicago hotels. That didn't sound right. Of utmost importance to me is noise & cleanliness, so I give this place a thumbs-up. The A/C is rather loud, which forces me to hit three stars instead of four -- but I must also add that the AC works quite well even so.   The breakfast buffet is better than most, and if you just want to take a couple of items to go (as I find to be most useful), they charge you very reasonable a la carte prices (well, as reasonable a hotel fare goes). Staff is courteous & helpful; service is prompt, and they have good in-room coffee for brewing.  I always consider that a plus as it enables me to be civil once I'm ready to go downstairs & use the biz center or get breakfast. If you want to get nitpicky, the gym doesn't have any floor mats. So what? It's clean and the equipment is modern and clean. The comfort, convenience and service make this a great bargain. I would book my boss here and he is WAY fussy about hotels. Check it out!",3
1406,"Pros: Great location (50 feet from Michigan Avenue) Reasonable price (after using several web sites) Nice modern comfortable room Reasonably quiet Front desk and attendants were helpful and for the most part polite Good concierge advice (Giordano's and Gino's deep dish pizza are both within walking distance) If you love shopping: great shopping is blocks away. Cons: Internet was $10 per day One day we needed to use the internet from the ""office"". That was $20 per hour. If you have a car, parking is over $50 per day. There is much cheaper parking a few blocks away. This deserved 3 1/2 stars. What made me go with three stars was the memory of the day I had to use the internet downstairs and I ended up paying $20+ for the hour I used it. My next hotel had free internet in the lobby.",3
1407,"Good hotel if you're just in town to do the tourist stuff and hit the shopping.  We were able to walk everywhere or hop on a bus or train.  Awesome bathroom/shower!!  If you're looking for a great view from your room go somewhere else, all you'll see are the buildings next door or across the street.  Room was clean, bed was fine.  Only real downside was we could hear EVERYTHING in the hallways.  Every ding of the elevator was clear as a bell and heard every person on our floor coming and going.  Didn't sleep well due to noise but everything else was pretty decent.",4
1408,"This is a great hotel to stay in but beware, if you leave something behind you most likely won't see it again! I stayed here for a wok trip and had a blast. The hotel is very nice, concierge is extremely helpful, beds were comfy and the martini bar was delicious. However....and I know it's partly my fault but... I left a very expensive hair curler in the room to the left of the sink and 24 hours later when I called and realized I hadn't packed it, housekeeping said it was no where to be found! I swear to you I left it there, right in that spot, would bet my life on it and STILL, it's no where to be found by the staff. So I definitely recommend this place but don't leave anything behind!",3
1409,"Pros: -Reasonably priced nightly rates -Modern, clean furnishings -Spacious rooms (at least our's was!) Cons: -$53/day + tip to park!! (tip: Drake Parking Garage across the street is $35/day, or there's a self-park garage a block past the hotel at 200 E. Walton that's $29/day) -Internet isn't complimentary ($10/day!! In this day and age where all hotels offer free WiFi, this just seems absurd!) -Horrible rain head in shower made it impossible to get soap out of thick hair! -Unfriendly front desk staff seemed like we were inconveniencing them to check in or ask a question Bottom line: Hotel is nice enough, but the 'hidden fees,' coupled with moody service, make it way overpriced for what you get.",3
1410,"The best 12th Night party in 105 Years (Jan 29th)... Thanks Knickerbocker! Our group had a beautiful suite with a bathroom that was almost as big as the living room. The party was wonderful, the staff fun and friendly as 300 costumed, crazy-people took over their hotel. The bars were serving hurricanes which helped to fill the lighted-up-disco-dance-floor. We had a great time. Hopefully, they'll let us come back next year.",5
1411,"I was at the Knickerbocker for my wedding and I can't sing enough praises of the staff. Each and every person we came in contact with was polite and helpful at every turn.  I couldn't have asked for a better evening. All of my guest were in awe of the beautiful space, delicious food, and 5 star service.  As were hubby and I. The champagne parade was a big hit.  We loved it! My husband was concerned that having our reception at such a luxe location would make him and his family/friends feel uncomfortable or out of place. I assured him otherwise and after 5 minutes of arriving at the cocktail hour he realized there was nothing to worry about.  Upon arriving we were greeted by a waiter and he had champagne in our hands almost instantly. Since there were only about 10 minutes left in the cocktail hour the waiters went out of their way to pick bride and groom out of the crowd so that we could get a taste of the delicous appetizers. Mm-mmmm the mini beef wellington...who knew such a small piece could be so flavorful. The only 'hiccup' occured when we got to Parlor G where the bridesmaids were scheduled to get hair and make-up only to find that many of the outlets in the room weren't working. This was definitely a problem with the hair dryers, curling irons, etc that needed to be plugged in. But about 5 minutes after placing a call to the front desk a maintenance staffer was at the room with extension cords and a power strip to get us by.  Also the internet access is like something out of the '90s...why not just charge it to the room? All in all I will definitely recommend the Knickerbocker to visiting guests or locals who want to get away.  We can't wait to return for our anniversary.",5
1412,"the shuttle from O'hare was long, but the driver was nice enough to inform us that the knickerbocker used to be one of the first gentlemen's club in the area and YES the hotel hosted Playboy back in the days. the location was great! minutes from everything imaginable, lake, shopping, even OPRAH winfrey's home [the big white house on oak st 2 blocks down] the room was small, but the decor made it cute. morning breakfast was served and it was a gigantic meal for the price, quite fulfilling. the hotel staff were nice and accomodating. the bartender at the martini bar made a martini like no other, ONE martini each and we were done for. one of the best martinis i've had. the price was fair, considering a million and one conventions the weekend we went.",4
1413,i've never stayed at the hotel but i did work with them to plan our med school Winter Formal. We got an awesome deal on catering and drinks and the staff was more than happy to have our group. The room where we were was amazing! The light up dancefloor gave it just what we needed to make the formal a huge success. they were more than accomodating and i would not hesitate to work with them again. my only complaint (and it was partly our fault because we got started late) was that they picked up dinner plates really quickly and some people were not done eating yet. other than that everything went off without a hitch!,4
1414,"Great hotel.   Really its all about location and this hotel has it.   You are right on the dreamy romantic part of Michigan Ave. and a just walk from everything.  The rooms are smallish, but the old school elegance of this hotel is tangible and cannot be faked.  You really feel its years envelop you and it welcomes you back from your jaunts like an old friend or drowsy lover.  When I stay here I always park in a pay lot and walk or take a cab since you could stay a week at a chain motel for what you pay to keep your car in the garage over the night.   See you there.",4
1415,"They employee thieves as valets. The hotel itself is good, but if you valet your car with them, they assume that anything not bolted down is theirs for the taking. You want to stay at the hotel? Go for it, but if you think you're car is safe with their valets, you got another thing coming.",1
1416,"The Millennium Knickerbocker is tucked away just about a half-block east of North Michigan Avenue. I like to refer to this hotel as a mini-Drake, as it is in essence a smaller version of the Drake Hotel across the street. The Knickerbocker is an older property, so the rooms are quite elegant but very average in size. The bathrooms have very little shelf space (and I am a guy). Try to have a look around the attractive public spaces, and there is a cozy library-like nook that is around the corner from the piano bar.",4
1417,"The man and I decided to do a last minute hotwire valentine's night in the city and this hotel is one we got. I have to say the price, $95 is incredibly low for a downtown hotel. I loved the close proximity to the Mag mile shopping and restaurants. The hotel itself is very quaint but they have remodeled it in a streamlined way. The room was small but big enough for two. The bed extremely comfortable and the big screen TV a hit. I was disappointed that there wasn't a bath tub (it being valentines day and all) but the rain head shower was nice. Staff were friendly, the girl at check in with the dripping nose should probably get a hanky though! LOL I'd go back and might if it ends up being my hotwire selection next time!",3
1418,"The hotel is under construction. The elevators were crowded. The door staff ogled me every time I entered and left. The inside staff could have been more friendly, more helpful, and much better and pretending to be enthused about working in customer service.",2
1419,"We stayed here during our wedding weekend: 11.21.08-11.24.08. We had many questions in prepping for this stay, and our contact, Ann, always responded quickly and almost always with a happy result. Our suite was large, clean, and brand-new. The bedding was very comfortable, the whirlpool tub was great, and the TVs were awesome (although barely used). We appreciated the use of the steamer for my dress, the free internet and the tray of fruits and champagne. We enjoyed the carolers and extra Holiday cheer in the lobby. It was a shame that the renovations were not able to be completed, though it is beautiful all the same. And everyone was very friendly to us. And, of course, the location is unbeatable. The room was a lacking a few things, such as a hook tall enough for a wedding dress, good bathroom lighting and quiet ventilation. Also, a maid had left the door open when we left for over an hour (the deadbolt was engaged, so the door could not close). That could have ended very badly for us. Thankfully, all was fine, and they were able to compensate us satisfactorily for the scare, although it took some work to get to that point. We look forward to staying with you next year - hopefully, in warmer weather, so we can take advantage of the beach.",4
1420,"What a run down dump.  A far cry from a 4 star hotel, although you can tell it has some history.  It's in desperate need of renovation.",2
1421,"Stayed here courtesy of Hotwire and a $110/night room. I think it was worth it. The front desk and staff were polite. The hotel does seem a little outdated but it was still clean. The room itself was small with a minimal design. The bed was very comfortable. The walls were thin. The location of this hotel is good for tourists, that is if you're a tourist that likes to shop which wasn't really a priority for me. It was about 7-10 minutes from a Loop stop.",4
1422,"We attended a great party at the Knickerbocker. The staff there was great, food was great the light up dance floor in the main ballroom is a landmark in Chicago.",4
1423,the bar's prices kinda suck for a place that no one knows about.,2
1424,"Still delivers the goods two years after my initial review. Smaller than some of the other chain hotels in River North/Gold Coast, the Knickerbocker has a nice boutique hotel feel to it.",4
1425,"Wonderful!!! We stayed in the winter time (obviously, very off-season), but we scored the room for $70/ night from Hotwire. It's in a great location, the staff was wonderful, and I found the building to be quite charming. The bed was unbelievably comfortable, and the bathroom was one of the nicest I've ever encountered. I would definitely stay there again!",5
1426,"Attended a conference in this hotel and stayed here for 4 nights. The bellhop guys were so friendly and funny and the staff was very accommodating. The rooms were a tad small, but bed was very comfy. Pricey but nice hotel.",4
1427,5 Stars for the bed - quite possibly one of the most comfortable beds I've been in.  The pillows are soooo SOFT.  I had a pleasant stay and all I could think about while I was at work was getting back to the room so I could sleep!,4
1428,What a great old hotel in a great location. Everything we expected for a hotel in the city. Nice rooms and cool little martini bar in the lobby. A very short walk from Michigan Ave. and all the action.,4
1429,"I wound up staying here recently while attending a conference.  The conference hotel (The Drake) was full, and while there was a Westin just down the street (I usually stay at Westins), the particular Westin in question had horrible reviews. I'm glad I stayed at the Knickerbocker.  The rooms were nicely appointed.  The bed was VERY comfortable (and I'm quite picky about such things). I didn't eat at the restaurant, but I did visit the bar twice.  Both bartenders were really friendly - when I asked if they had a preference for one wine over another, they articulated a preference and then (to my delight) gave me a small pour of their suggestion.  In one case I didn't like the suggested wine and they gave me a taste of a different wine.  They both treated me like I was an old friend/regular.  Very friendly - very laid back.  Exactly what you want after a long day of business. The hotel was a great value relative to the other hotels nearby and the staff were great.",4
1430,"I stayed here while on business.  Our room had been updated and was very comfortable although the lighting was horrible.  I understand the 'mood lighting' and don't mind it generally, but I draw the line at the bathroom.  You've got to brighten up the bathroom at least.  I couldn't see to put on make-up.  Annoying.   Everyone was super friendly and accommodating during our stay.  I didn't dine at the restaurants but I did feel the in room meal prices were too high.  We spent $55 on (2) egg breakfasts and a pot of coffee (after gratuity).  $55, Really?!  Are you kidding?",3
1431,Is a four style place for the awesome shower. Loved it.,4
1432,"My elderly parents needed an ADA compliant room with two double beds. The room was elegant and accommodated them easily. The room was clean, quiet and the beds were ""fresh"" and luxurious. The door men were always ready to help them in and out of the car. Also, when they did not answer their phone the concierge personally went to their room to make them aware we were waiting for them. The restaurant serves breakfast and lunch only. You don't need dinner because of all the restaurants within walking distance you will want to try from the Cheesecake Factory to The Rosebud Steak House, etc. The breakfast menu is simple and delicious and fairly priced. We had breakfast for $80 with tip for four adults. The omelets were perfectly made and the contents fresh and perfectly sautéed. The oatmeal, my favorite, was made well and that means it was freshly made with attention to detail. The bacon was well cooked, but not burnt as I asked. One note, basic single rooms have one king sized bed in a smaller room. If you need two double beds or a larger room there will be an up charge of about $30 or more per night. Parking approaches $60 plus tips for the door man so it is not recommended you stay here if you have a car to park. I made the reservation on Priceline and I saw no difference in how we were treated because of the discounted rate. The sales staff also has excellent email communication skills so you can get exactly what you need and confirmation emails to set you mind at ease.",3
1433,"Was in here a few weeks ago for a drink with a group of clients.  The bartender added a significant extra tip to my bar bill without my authorization.  A number of calls the following week to the front desk, beverage manager, and hotel manager went completely ignored and unreturned.  Nuff said.",1
1434,"I booked this hotel on PRICELINE and just like my fellow YELPERS say, they don't give you the suite advertised.  I knew this going into it so I asked why not and they told me they don't for people who booked through 3d parties.  Well after giving them a dissapointed look and telling them I was not happy about this, the OMNI did right by giving me a proper suite that they advertise on their website. The hotel is a bit older but is still a great spot.  Location can't be beat, as it is within walking distance to anything you want to do in Chicago except maybe Wrigley (5 miles away).  I will def. use this hotel again in the future.  The only reason I'm not going 5 stars is because the stunt they pulled by trying to give me a lower quality room for booking through a third party.   Tip:  Any room that ends in 18 is going to be a lower quality room, do not accept this.",4
1435,"Holy disappointments! The hotel is BEIGE and kind of blah everywhere and the carpets/rugs are dirty and worn. There isnt nearly enough lighting in the rooms and the seating (one hard backed chair by the desk and one small pull out couch...no other seats at all) in the ""suites"" is non-existent...why have a suite that sleeps 4 or 6 but not enough seating for the  group to all sit together in the same room to eat and/or watch TV? The food is nothing special at all, cheap ingredients disguised by froo froo plating presentations and high prices. The toiletries are cheap and the ancient TV in the bedroom of suite 1806 is so dark you can't watch the $16 movies ( BTW- engineering advised there is no bright adjustment because of the Lodgenet remote....but then nearly insisted on replacing the TV at 9pm while I was in my PJs, ummmmm, no thanks). Only reason I even purchased a movie is because it was cloudy and raining outside and so the cable/satellite was out ( searching for signal) on every channel for about 4 hours. The room doors SLAM 24/7 so if youre a light sleeper, bring earplugs. Good news ~ the beds are comfy, the location is excellent, close to alot of great restaurants and shopping, taxis are quick and easy to find. Cant believe this is where Oprah used to house her guests.",2
1436,"This was our first stay at an Omni.  We booked this as part of a land air package via Travelocity. Located on the Magnificent Mile, it was a very nice stay.  We got a king one bedroom suite on the 20th floor.  Other folks in our group were on the 22nd and 25th (highest) floor respectively.  We had a view of the Trump from our window. Our bed was turned down every night.  Fresh linens replaced twice a day. You can request a courtesy refrigerator separate from the mini bar.   USA Today delivered daily. You enter from the street up to the hotel lobby on the third floor.  Then take another elevator to your room. There's a food cart with Starbucks coffee and breakfast items for sale.   You can print your boarding pass at no charge in the business center. Wi-Fi is available at $9.95 a day or free if you're a loyalty member.  Sign up for free to join the club.  I passed. Hubby worked out at the fitness center.   We also requested late checkout.  They gave us until 1:30 pm. I'd stay here again.",5
1437,"Just recently returned from my three night stay here. We stayed in a King Suite on the 27 floor for around 480 a night. + The service from the staff was probably the best part of the stay at the Omni. The staff were extremely helpful and professional.  The turn down service was great as well. The room was a generous size. Complimentary wifi if you sign up for the select guest program, connectivity was great. - Our bathroom was extremely small. Two people could not get ready at the same time and the only other mirror to use to get ready was outside of the bathroom and above the bar. - The carpets were stained and our pillow cases had stains on them. - The decor was outdated. Overall, the stay at the Omni was disappointing. Considering the price we paid we would've paid a little extra and indulged in a more modern and trendy hotel.",3
1438,"I came here for a stay over the weekend.  I have to say that the service was superb and the staff was all really nice.  They made our bed once in the morning and once at night.  The beds at Omni was also very comfortable, more comfortable than the bed that I slept at home.  The curtain was also thick and really good so it sheds out all the light.  They also had all the little stuff that made life a little bit better, such as liquid soap, shampoo, cotton balls, q-tips, sea salt for the bath tub, shampoo and conditioner, and lotion. The place smelled good.  TV also had cable, and I had wifi connection as well.  I had a good time at Omni and will be staying there again if I ever go back to Chicago.  Location for this hotel is also good because you are within walking distance in downtown Chicago so everything is a few blocks away.",5
1439,"Babysitting again... got to enjoy a night sitting on my computer in front of the TV while the baby slept. Its not Peninsula or Ritz Carlton, but its a nice hotel.  The layout of the room was a sitting room connected to a bedroom.  The bathroom was spacious and the living area included a wet bar and a desk.  The room was very clean and the housekeeping came down to turn down the room bringing milk and cookies - a very nice touch.",4
1440,Omni Hotel was the site of our committee meeting. We have volunteers fly in from across the US so my review is not only of the meeting room space and service but also on the hotel rooms...or at least mine. The Meeting Space: Just fine as far as meeting rooms go. It was clean. The A/V peeps were available to help us with any issues we were having (which not many). The space was set up bright and early every morning for our meetings. The food for the meetings was pretty decent. You know how hotel meeting food can be. They put on quite the spread for our lunch service and we were quite pleased. The banquet and meetings staff were extremely helpful and even loaded up our A/V equipment and other valuables to be locked up with security so we didn't have to lug it back to our rooms. They took care of it all for us without a hitch! The Hotel: Omni is a very nice hotel. It's in a great location for a meeting or a weekend away. It's a little confusing though as the lobby is on the third floor and you have to take different elevators to get to the lobby or meeting spaces vs. the elevators for the rooms. I'm not a fan of this set up but it's not the end of the end of the world or anything.   The Rooms: This is an all suites hotel. I appreciate having a separate living area. My room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The room itself was spacious and they have a nice turn down service. Our volunteers were quite happy with the rooms as well. I would not hesitate to stay here on my own accord and I would most definitely book another meeting here. Some of our volunteers stayed the weekend after our meeting was over to enjoy what Chicago has to offers. It's location is ideal for the out of towner and the service you'll receive is top notch.,4
1441,"Pros: 1) All suite hotel, great for kids, lots of space and two TV's.  Kids and parents could watch different TV shows. Fridge and microwave were put to good use with all of our leftovers. 2) Ordered room service twice and food was delivered very quickly. The burger is one of the best, if not THE best burger I've ever had. We ordered the burger twice during our stay. 3) EXCELLENT location. Walking distance to Giordano's, Gino's East, Rosebud Italian Restaurant, Water Tower Place, Navy Pier, Lakeshore, Apple Store, and John Hancock, and Eggsperience. 4) Really tasty coffee provided for free in room (2 cup coffee maker) 5) Housekeeping was excellent. They left extra toiletries, towels, creamer, coffee upon request. 6) Lots of drawer space for clothing. 7) Didn't get to use fitness center, but it looked nice and clean. TVs on cardio equipment. Cons: 1) Sink and shower wouldn't drain quickly enough. 2) Required to transfer elevators at lobby level to get up to rooms. From street, you take one elevator up to 3rd floor, then transfer to second set of elevators. 3) No Disney channel. (Nickolodeon available) 4) Bed comfort could be improved.",4
1442,"Simply beautiful!  Located in the heart of the windy city, Omni Hotel offers top notch singular service.  Quick and simple check in and the rooms are quaint. The views are incredible, reminds of the couples retreat movie quote: ""It looks like a screen saver."" The view of Sears tower up close and personal, I had a take a moment and just soak in the view.  Don't forget to join the select guest program for free wifi~!! Room:  A Cleanness: A Overall: A ps. Don't forget to try Cafe 676 and their PB & J Waffle Panini *trust me its GOOD""",5
1443,"Join their select guest program, the benefits are real and significant unlike a lot of other places. Search and work for good rates.  Omni's prices are always going up and down.  I get the best luck when I call the hotel directly.  The website and toll free number are unyielding.  Great hotel, clean rooms, excellent location, great staff -very friendly, free room service coffee every morning for select guests.  Restaurant and bar are way over priced and I don't like the starbucks coffee they serve every day but I can overlook this.  I love starbucks and their specialty drinks but their ordinary coffee has always tasted a bit skunky to me.  Also the sliding doors for the bathrooms can't be locked.  If I weren't staying alone or shared a room on a business trip this would be awful. Thanks to Chicago's crappy zoning regulations, one thing that's really a shame and will change Omni forever is the Ritz-Carlton.  Ritz-Carlton is building a massive hotel just to the South of Omni.  I mean there may be 6 inches if that between these hotels and the Ritz extends just a about 4 feet closer to Michigan completely ruining the South view and corner room views Omni had on Michigan.  What were once top rate, top price rooms, are now the worst rooms in the hotel.  What a bummer.  Omni can't be happy. Still a great hotel that can be had a fair prices.  Thanks to the Ritz maybe even better prices.",4
1444,"We took a large family trip to chicago and stayed at Omni in June. There were seven of us on this trip and we booked 3 rooms. Although we had three government ID's the hotel was only able to give us two rooms at the governemnt employee rate. They said this was due to the hotel being sold out and so there were no more discount rates avaliable? This did not make any sense. We stayed for 6 nights and 7 days. Never once was the room service the same. One night they would turn dow the bed all the way, the next just take the pillows off, the next they would hide the pillows in the closet.... It was weird. The hotel offers a Select Guest program, which we signed up for before even going to Chicago. When we got there the check-in staff did not mention it at all, we had to bring it up. With the beverage program, as a part of the select guest thing: I would mark for them to knock and bring in our drinks, but the only time it was brought in was the day that I ask for it to be left out..... so strange. The selecet guest program stated that the hotel had a pillow bar, you could pick a feather pillow or a foam pillow. We ask for feather but never got it. We ask a couple of times. The select guest program stated it included a nightly treat and a bottle of water, yet we never got either brought to the room. The internet did not work half the time and we needed the internet as we had to work while we were on vacation. Elevators were weird, you couldn't even take the stairs if you wanted to....who does that? The billing was really weird as well. They charged our credit card 1800 dollars when we checked in and then when we reviewed out billing statment when we were leaving we noticed that they charged us for the internet that we were told was free so they had to go back and credit us. Then it took about a week for the internet charges to be credited. This type of billing caused the fraud department on everyones credit cards to shut down the cards until we called to get things fixed ..... a hassel that could have been avoided had Omni charged per night or at the end of our stay. The location was nice, but we felt like we still had a long way to go for most things, other than shopping. Although this used to be the hotel that Oprah used, it looked more like something Jerry Springer would use. Overall it was just a plain old hotel. I would NEVER pay $219+ tax and fees to stay here again. I would have rather stayed at a Motel 6.",1
1445,"Although the Omni is always a great choice, for some reason the bf felt like it would also be haunted. It wasn't. It was simply a fantastic hotel in a fantastic location in the heart of Chicago where you want to be if you're a first time visitor. Let me qualify this for a moment ... having been to Chicago several times for different occasions, I've come to discover that the whole Michigan Ave, Rush St, Lincoln Park thing is cool, but it's only a small part of what Chicago is really about. All those times I complained about having to go further than 2 miles from the area I was missing out on so much outside of what tourism has become of Chicago. One take on the Architecture Tour will show you all the other neighborhoods you're missing out on. Regardless, the Omni is nice, high class, great accommodations and very attentive staff. In most cities it's one of the best hotels and in Chicago it's no different although I make a convincing argument for some great boutiques I've had a chance to stay with. The restaurant has pretty good fares so room service would also be on par, but be prepared to pay a premium for having it in your room versus just coming downstairs, even if you're not dressed up.",4
1446,Did an overnight here with the family so my daughter and I could do a Memories with Mom package at American Girl. Omni does NOT disappoint! Found a package for around $365 - not bad for a Friday night stay in the heart of the Mag Mile that included overnight parking AND $50 worth of breakfast. Check in - fast and smooth. Kids received a little Welcome Backpack thingie with little toys and a snack in it. Later that evening - cookies and milk were delivered to our room for the kids. They really take care of their little guests! Join their Select Guest Pgm so you could get the free wifi!!!,5
1447,"Alright, I've stayed here a few times. Here is what's going on at this swank joint on the Mag Mile: I'm going to say I do NOT recommend making this reservation via Priceline or Travelocity or a site of the type. You will end up getting their ""Studio"" room which isn't really given in ANY of the room descriptions (as it different GREATLY from the regular one rooms that others will get. I learned this my first time staying. Needless to say, I was not happy that I wasn't getting the room type I had asked for. I spoke with their CS Rep online and wasn't given any remedy to make it right. Worst customer service call experience I ever had. Finally, the hotel manager offered a consolation to the misunderstanding. Before you book, also, make sure you save up for their Guest Rewards Programn, which entitles you to several freebies. The rooms are SWANKY! Very nice indeed. Modern furniture and the bed will make you just want to sink in it and never get up. Heck, you even get ROBES! The restaurant they have there is nice. Nice decor, decent food....but pricey. But hey, let's face it, if you're staying here, you're obviously not broke. Hotel staff is generally very helpful in anything you need, so don't be afraid to ask them. I had all my requests taken care of. It's prime location for all your shopping needs. My SO (Significant Other) was pleased with the location and was poised to make this spot for our stay as it is so close to so many retail stores. Downers about this place? The access to the lobby and elevators. They are on the 2nd floor which requires an elevator to get to. It's weird. Also, I'd like better customer service. Mine wasn't bad....but I've had better. I'm paying good money for this hotel so I'd expect excellent customer service.",3
1448,"I think we got a good deal here $600 for 3 nights...we fit 6ppl in a room and it didn't feel too crammed. We 2 full/queen beds and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was not comfortable so when it was my turn to sleep on it, I just slept on the floor. The hotel is very conveniently located. Almost everything was a 10-15 min walk from where we lived. When I had to buy a pair of shorts (since it was blazing hot all of a sudden), I was very grateful that Express was right next door. The hotel itself is a bit old so you have to go up two flights of elevators to get to your room. There aren't many of them and they are slow. You can't even take the stairs if you wanted to since they are for emergencies only. Also, I hate when you request more blankets, they give you those janky, light blankets...how are you supposed to keep warm?? Other than that, the housekeeping was very nice. The blanket thing isn't their fault....she did give us tons of towels. The pool is small, but it's nice to play in if it's raining outside.",4
1449,Nice.  Did a stay-cation for Valentine's day and it hit the spot.  The biggest upset-- NO JACUZZI.  I was up for a bubbly soak but it was out of order.  So sad.,3
1450,"Was here for work and LOVED it. Comfortable suites with great service and an amazing view of the city. You really can't go wrong staying at any Omni, just this was especially nice due to the service and location.   Located on Michigan Avenue, your close to shopping and tons of restaurants. The rooms have a full-sized living room with flat screen, desk and wet bar area. The french doors lead to the bedroom with another TV, and the bathroom is very modern stocked with premium bath products. For work or pleasure, it's a great stay.",4
1451,"Absolutely amazing property. My room is so beautiful, and the whole hotel is so luxe! Coming in late last night, with the snow falling, was magical. More to come!!",5
1452,"It may not have the same celebrity rep as the ""Peninz"" down the street but this hotel is fantabulastic!  It's clean, trendy (but not TOO trendy)and the rooms are a cute suite-style with a separate ""sitting/pullout couch"" area.  A major star for location - right on Michigan Ave in the Magnificent Mile Zone. My favorite part of the Omni is it's lounge - it's a swank but comfy bar on the 4th level.  The lounge looks over Michigan Ave so you can check out all that hustle and bustle while you cocktail!  Totally reminds me of why I like drinking in hotel bars - guess I will have to go on a new party circuit ASAP.",5
1453,"Oh, Omni, I expected more from you.  I stayed here for 5 nights and was satisfied with most of what I saw, but not wowed.  The bed was one of the more comfortable beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on in a hotel.  What staff I interacted with were very polite and friendly.  Plenty of channels on the TV.  Valets were prompt and helpful, but parking was a little more expensive ($49/day) than most of the other hotels I researched in planning this trip.  Location is great, close to plenty of shops and restaurants as well as an El stop (red line).  And they take the government rate, which is always a plus in my book. However.  Two major problems: 1) Internet service is a must in any hotel nicer than a pay-by-the-hour motel.  Omni has wi-fi, and it's free if you join their free loyalty program.  If you don't join the program, you can pay, and that's fine.  However, about half the time I was at the Omni I couldn't connect.  I called their internet service line, and the guy told me that their servers were full and to ""keep trying.""  I usually had to ""keep trying"" until the next day.  To effectively not have internet available is not acceptable, especially in a hotel that gets so many business travelers. 2) Weird smell in the bathroom accompanied by a toilet that wouldn't completely flush.  I'll spare you the details, but somehow there were always, uh, ""leftovers,"" no matter what I was flushing.  As for the smell, it was not overpowering but kind of reminded me of the poor plumbing you find in Europe. The internet thing bars me from staying here again if I ever come back to Chicago for business.  If I ever come back to Chicago not for business I will probably not stay here either, knowing that there are better, cheaper hotels in the area.",3
1454,"This is one of the nicest hotel I stayed at! Room is cozy and roomy, lots of space, it has a separate hangout area for the FLAT SCREEN TV and chair, and the bedroom has another TV!!! I'm in TV heaven!!! Great view.  Great Staff.",4
1455,"Nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways, fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the Omni. Location was great but there are a lot of other options. If you get a really good deal on the room, I wouldn't say no.",2
1456,"The Omni is spectacular. My husband and I had our wedding ceremony, reception, and post-wedding breakfast here, and couldn't have been happier. Rooms are very elegant and cozy but are ""suites"" (tiny sitting room) which seems very posh. More importantly, the service here is impeccable. Claire, our wedding coordinator at the Omni, did such a great job. One great thing about the Omni, as compared to other hotels in the area, is that the lobby is on the second level so there's not as much traffic from tourists.",5
1457,"How cool is it that every room is a suite? I love it.   Pros: 1. absolutely beautiful hotel 2. in downtown, right on the strip so everything was easily accessible 3. there is a walgreens right across the street - perfect for buying some water and snacks 4. the concierge. gotta give it up for my man marcus. so incredibly friendly, so incredibly knowledgeable 5. the staff overall was incredibly friendly, and not in a pretentious fake way 6. the restaurant 676 serves pretty decent food 7. there is a starbucks cart right in the lobby! (but it's not free, boo) cons: 1. kind of a weird floor plan. you walk in, you take the elevator up to the 3rd floor (where the main lobby is), and then from there you can take an elevator up to your rooms. why not just have an elevator on the street that accesses rooms using room keys? 2. this really isn't a con, but i found this to be perplexing. the bathroom is huge. and there is only one tiny trash can, and it's against the far wall by the toilet. i would move the trash can so it would be more central, and every day, house keeping would move it back by the toilet. 3. the mini fridge is kind of small.  thankfully i'm the master of rearranging fridges to make things, like my cupcakes from more and my leftover gino's east pizza, fit in there. I had a great time at the Omni. It wasn't the fanciest hotel I've ever stayed in (one had a pillow ""menu"" so you can ask for pillows you like), but it was very pleasant.  Kudos to the staff, you made the stay very enjoyable.",4
1458,"I got mad move for ya omni...! Its probably a 4 or 4.5 star hotel but it acts like a 10! I loved the rooms, the (albeit small) pool and hot tub. no one was ever on the terraces and they had a beautiful view. housekeeping and all staff was awesome. the concierges were a daily stop for me. they set up a lil starbucks cart for coffeee, muffins and fruit. the store is really small, for basics only (not a gift or souvenier shop) and it is to the left of the front desk staff. 24/7 u use ur room key to access it and bring ur purchases to the front desk people.",5
1459,"Full disclosure: I haven't actually slept in this hotel. I have, however, visited friends staying here, and let me tell you, this place is pretty dang swank. It trends toward new-money opulence--modern but luxe (I'm thinking of this in comparison to, say, the SF Fairmont, which feels like walking into Buckingham bloody Palace). My pals managed to get a suite with two double beds they seemed to love, plus deluxe bathroom, and separate parlor, which is awesome and, apparently, standard. Genius. Combined with great location--right on the Mag Mile!--it would make for a super shopping weekend or even a nice base of operations for any of the many summer festivals and events. Also, you needn't fear shoddy cleanup service. Housekeeping is very diligent. When my friends decided they'd rather stay in and skip the housekeeping, the response was: ""What? You don't want housekeeping?! Okaaay..."" It's a lot funnier spoken aloud, promise.",4
1460,"I love the Omni. Staff is really friendly and they make sure you have a great stay. Before you go there definitely sign up for their Select Guest Program. (It's like one of those mileage program or hotel loyalty program. No fee) Once you sign up without doing anything your already a Gold member which means  you get complimentary Wi-Fi (really, all hotels should have free Wi-Fi), pressing service, shoe shine, morning beverage delivery, bottled water on the day of arrival. And the morning beverages are great, you get 2 beverages of your choice including coffee, tea, orange, grapefruit, tomato, apple juice, bottled water or hot chocolate. The gym isn't huge but it has lots of elliptical machines and treadmills. It's only open from 6am till 11pm though. There's also a pool and hot tub but according to my friend there's a high level of chlorine. It's on MIchigan Avenue which is like 5th Avenue in New York so it's close to everything. I especially liked going to get breakfast at the Pierrot Gourmet  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/… ) The rooms are all suites so you will have a living room with 2 arm chairs, desk and a sink with flat screen tv, bedroom with a tv and bathroom. I also got a mini fridge and a microwave because my stay was a little long. (no fee)  There was a waiting list but it became available in like 2 days. There are no charge for the fridge but you need to request it.",5
1461,"My review deals only with the restaurant in the hotel. I stopped here with a friend who wanted to visit the hotel that sponsors Oprah. The restaurant was quite attractive, informal but with an upscale atmosphere. The menu selection was good but I expected more from such a supposedly outstanding Hotel and restaurant. The dessert selection, my highest interest, was also lacking in variety. No doubt it was good. But it wasn't that creative and not one of my ""favorite things"". The service was great, the staff pleasant and the views from the windows were great. It was a good time. I'm not sure Oprah, given her status, would dine here. But she probably thought it good enough for her audience. :-)",3
1462,"The Omni Chicago is a great place to stay on business trips. It's centrally located to everything important-- Navy Pier, John Hancock, Millennium Park, etc. The lobby of the hotel is actually on the 3rd floor which is somewhat weird, you also have to take the elevator from the 1st floor and transfer on the 3rd to get to your room (for security i suppose). I would suggest upgrading to a room with a ""City View"" as the standard rooms all face surrounding buildings and you'll feel like you're in a prison block. The suites also have a couple large TVs (over 40 inches maybe?). Since I'm an unapologetic snob at times, I greatly appreciated the old fashion turn down service (for those of us who are too lazy to pull back our own bed covers and lay out our own robe before bed). The only con would be the Valet Parking which is about $50/day, but that's more of a Chicago problem and not necessarily that of the Omni.",4
1463,"I stayed at the Omni Hotel and had a problem.  Why the 5 star review?  Read on.   I chose to stay at the Omni Hotel on an overnight layover after returning from a month in Europe.  I chose this location so I could take my teenage son out for some Chicago style pizza because, unlike me, he had never been before.  The check in process and staff were awesome, we were greeted with a smile and they made sure to take very good care of us right down to leaving chocolate chip cookies and milk outside the door for my son,complimentary water, etc.  Great start!  Our suite was well appointed and very comfortable.   In keeping with our ""plan"" we picked up a pizza and stored it in the refrigerator to take back to the west coast the next day.  The following morning we left our room for a little sightseeing before we left.  Upon return to our room we discovered the housekeeping staff had thrown out our pizza.  I contacted the front desk and they apologized and offered a credit at their on site restaurant but we had already had reservations at another restaurant and this didn't really replace the item that was disposed of.  We left a little disappointed and I wondered why they didn't just replace the pizza as the pizza place (Giordano's) was literally just around the corner.  I arrive home and within a day or two I receive an email survey from Omni hotels.  In the survey I describe the situation.  Within 2 days I get another email from the Omni hotel with their apologies and an offer to ship a replacement out to me in California via FedEx overnight for the Giordano's pizza that was thrown out! That is great customer service!   Every business should be run this way, when there is a problem they fix it.  They have definitely earned my future business!",5
1464,"We're Chicago suburbanites but decided to stay overnight one weekend after snagging a fairly decent deal on Priceline.  Omni is literally right on Michigan Avenue (although it's probably better if you get a room that doesn't face Michigan Avenue for noise reduction).  Very ideally located if you intend to shop on the Mag Mile. It's a beautiful hotel, although the lobby/reception is technically on the 3rd floor so you have to take 2 elevators to get to your hotel room.  Not a biggie but during busy times, you'll wait a long time for an elevator.  It is a beautiful hotel.  The rooms are modern and beautifully decorated and very clean.  No bed bugs issues either!  LOL.  Bed was pretty comfortable.  Bath amenities are nothing to write home about, but it is a clean, decent bathroom.   We had room 1118, and it is a bit of a bizarre L-shaped room.  Didn't really seem like a suite to me, and the bed didn't seem separate from the living area space.  it wasn't a huge room as some other reviewers reported and we only had one flat screen TV, so maybe we didn't get a true suite.  But it is still a nice room.  hey have a nice turn-down service, too.  But maybe we got 1118 because that's the Priceline special. Only two complaints I have are these:  (1) Parking (valet) costs $49.  There goes the bargain we got on Priceline. (2) The bed in 1118 shares the same wall as the bathroom in the next room.  So whenever the people in the next room go to the bathroom or turn on their shower, that noise blares in your ear.  Loud as hell.  Every time they ran their shower or used the toilet, we heard them.  Also, there is a hell of a lot of door slamming.  Too bad they can't do something to soften the sound of the door.",4
1465,"I booked a 4 night, through the weekend, stay for my mother who was visiting from out of town. I know the area well and the hotel is definitely centrally located, walking distance to John Hancock, great stores and dining, and Millennium Park. It also appealed to me because all rooms are suites (which I assumed meant spacious) and the hotel has a pool. They assigned her a room on the 12th floor which had a horrific view of the building next door. Had I known it would be THAT bad, I would have definitely paid the extra $30 to get the room with a city view. I'm talking seal the window with bricks bad view. The living room area did not have a sofa but instead two armchairs, one of which did not have an accompanying ottoman. Website pictures made it look large and spacious but in reality that was not the case. Bedroom area was really good with enormous comfortable bed. Amenities: -Pool area was mediocre and filled with children when I went to take a look. -Also, the hotel has a complimentary car that guests can book during weekday business hours. A car was booked to take my mom to brunch - it was running late and she had to stand waiting with a friend on the ground floor area which had no seating. Her friend asked if they could just call them when the cab arrived while they waited in the seating area on the 3rd floor lobby. Hotel staff said they could not and admitted other guests had requested this service in the past. If the car booked is running late (fault of hotel) then it seems this is not too much to ask? All in all, I expected this hotel to be a great experience for my mom but was let down. Being the great mom that she is, she had no complaints, but I have a feeling if it were on her tab she would have had plenty ; )",2
1466,"Perfect location, rooms were nice and clean, but wasn't overly impressed with it. Believe it or not, I've had better service at lower priced hotels. ""24"" hour business center was closed, breakfast was so-so. It's a nice hotel for downtown, but I don't think I'd go back. There are plenty of other hotels DT or cheaper that I've experienced better service at.",3
1467,"Stayed here for 4 days and loved it! The hotel was right in the middle of everything and it was nice to be able to just walk around the city and explore. The hotel was really nice and the people were friendly - especially the guys up front! One of them even chased down a van to accommodate our large group when we were planning a night out on the town. I'd have to say one of the major advantages of this place is the location - you don't really have to go far to dine or shop, and even if you felt like taking a ten minute walk you could go right down to millennium park, the museum of contemporary art, or you could even take the red line which is 5 blocks away if you feel like venturing out farther. I would definitely consider this hotel again on my next stop in Chicago.",4
1468,"My stay at the Omni Chicago was fantastic during my 5 day 4 night stay in Chicago. The accomodations were all first class and the king size bed was super comfy. Also had a great view of the Hancock building from the room on the 20th floor. Location of hotel is very convinient off Michigan Avenue with a ton of stores to go out shopping and do a lot of sight seeing. Also before my stay here I enrolled in their Select Guest membership. With that I was able to get free Wi-Fi in my room, 2 complimentary beverages every morning, and free Chicago Tribune newspaper. Will stay here again if I'm ever in Chicago. Just had a wonderful time here.",5
1469,"I would never stay anywhere else in Chicago! My husband and I came here for a weekend trip while he was home on leave from Iraq. We already had a room booked (at a VERY affordable rate!) but when we arrived, the front desk clerk found out the reason for our stay, and we were upgraded to a deluxe suite! From there, it was pure heaven. The concierge was more than accommodating with helpful tips on where to go, best restaurants and tourist traps to avoid. I felt like the staff was anticipating our needs before we even had to ask! Room service was delicious and beautifully presented. We even spent one evening relaxing in the hotel bar with glamorous martinis and yummy herb popcorn. Can't wait to go back!",5
1470,"We stayed her one night and it was a great decision. Phenomenal location, we walked to everything. The room was nice, with a comfy bed. Good room service, with an unbelievably kind and accommodating staff. We would stay again for sure just for the location. It's an Added bonus for the suburban people that can just take the L down there and save the $49 a day valet fee.",5
1471,"Complete disappointment. Problems: 1. The alarm clock/stereo thing was broken in my room. It was constantly emitting low, changing hissing noises. Sooo annoying. And there was no off switch on the damn thing. I had to move the bed to unplug it (the outlet was wayyy back, buried behind the big bed). I kept hearing it, and didn't realize what it was, until it had kept me awake for a few hours. 2. The shower was ONLY incredibly hot. Turn it all the way cold...very hot. Turn it to hot, and you get boiling hot. Grrrrreat. So how do I get water that won't scald me? This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry, and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water. Good job Omni! 3. Hallway carpets are disgusting and old. Walking around, you'd think you're in a motel 6. And my floor had been flooded or something, and they had box fans running in the hallway, 24/7, to try to dry it out. Talk about an overpriced dump.",1
1472,"Great location, right off Michigan Avenue.  We had a one-bedroom suite, which was nice, although smaller than the other one-bedroom suite we stayed in (Millenium Knickerbocker Chicago).   We ordered breakfast room service the night before, and it arrived promptly the next morning and was delicious.   The entrance was kind of weird--you had to get into an elevator from the street to reach the lobby, and then get into another set of elevators to reach the rooms.  The lobby was modern and the concierge was wonderful.",4
1473,"This hotel was totally unreal! It was a wonderful experience to stay here, if only for a couple nights (because there is no way I could afford anything more). The room service was absolutely amazing (though pricey), and they really paid attention to the minor details of your order. It was truly an excellent selection for a conference, as the rooms were spacious, the food service was on point, and all the amenities in the hotel compliment both service and decor (and I didn't have to pay for all the additional stuff). As for the location, you are right in the heart of downtown Chicago! What more could you possibly ask for? (Except for lower rates maybe) I recommend anyone looking for an excellent time (and carrying with them a hefty budget) in Chicago to stay at this wonderful hotel, as your experience will undoubtedly be a good one.",4
1474,"This is a fabulous hotel. My room was a suite and overlooked Michigan Avenue and the Apple Store (with its grass roof...very cool sight). The room was sparkling clean, the internet access was fast and easy to access and the room was quiet. They even do a turn down service in the evening...something I hardly ever see any more. I was there for a conference. All food and service was excellent. This is also a great location with shopping and restaurants everywhere adjacent. I very much recommend this hotel.",4
1475,I Love This hotel.  Best place we stayed with the family.  They really took care of us.,5
1476,"I LOVE staying at this hotel!!  On special occasions my bf and I usually go and get hotel room for the weekend and just relax.  They have great rooms with flat screens....they also have a cute lil bar inside the hotel.....you get a great view, and it's walking distance to so many great restaurants and stores.  Plus, they provide you with cotton balls and q-tips in the bathroom...how great is that?  haha  =)",5
1477,Stayed four days two nights.Great large room. Select Guest Service thing was ok. I forgot to put the thing on the door one night until after 2am (yes i was out partying late!! ;)). No goodies. The 3rd night i forgot to put the delivery time (no goodies again).  The staff was friendly but in that very vague robotic customer service way.  The pool was great. I used that two of the three nights i stayed.  Location was perfect. On Michigan had access to to the Red Line train and the buses on both Chicago Ave and Michigan Ave.  It was overall very enjoyable stay.,3
1478,"I would say the suites are 'cozy', but definitely suit the needs of a business traveler.  The beds are comfy, the bathroom is nice.  They even give you bath salts.  There is a plasma tv in the 'living room'.  Most importantly the room has wireless internet access and you don't have to pay extra for it.  There's a gym too.  Everyone there is so nice. AND you're right there in middle of all the shopping.",5
1479,"Location alone knocks it up a star.  Right smack in the middle of the city and we walked to everything from Millenium Park to Navy Pier to the Hancock Tower and surrounding shops.  (We logged 30 miles walking those few days!)  The bed is super comfy which is such a rarity when we travel.  I always have a wrenched back whether we stay in a hotel or private residence so it was nice to wake up refreshed.  Jackie at the front desk was nice as were the valets and one particular bellman.  Some of the other front desk staff could take some cues from them.  Check in was super fast and we didn't even do the online check in.   The cons:  We wondered why housekeeping had it cranked up to 84 in there when we checked in and we soon found out why.  It was not only cold outside but cold in the bedroom as well.  The headboard is part of this huge uninsulated box that feels like wind is whipping up into it and when it's 20 degrees outside with wind gusts, that makes for some teeth chattering when trying to get some sleep.  I froze the whole time and we had to put the thin extra blanket against the headboard in a vain attempt for relief.  Between the vent directly above the toilet that connects you to your neighbor so you can hear *everything* and they can hear you too (good luck doing #2 without having a complex- one dude would whistle when we went into to bathroom to let us know he was in there. *rolling eyes*) and the adjoining doors between rooms with your other neighbor, I hope you don't value privacy!  We heard every word both neighbors said any time we were in the room so in an attempt to get decent sleep we'd close all of the doors leading to the bedroom.  The french doors and the really loud pocket door to the bathroom that would bang against the wall with every step you took regardless of where you were in the suite.  We had to fold up a paper and pad the bottom of the door.  At one point two different nights we thought someone was in our room but it was the neighbors talking.  FYI- there is a hospital a block across the street so you will hear sirens all day long (but you shouldn't be in your room that much if you're there for pleasure) but at night it's surprisingly quiet for being right on Michigan Ave.  (This could also be because it was 10 degrees at night when we were there)  You also need to close the door to the living room when using the power button in the bedroom or you will be turning on both TV's in the suite not just the one in the room you're in from the waves bouncing around somewhere. All in all, we'd likely stay there again if we couldn't find comparable within 2 blocks or so just because of the location but improving some of those things would be a surefire way to get our repeat business. Before you go, sign up for their free Omni Select Guest program and you'll get free wifi in your room instead of a $10 daily charge.  You'll also get 2 complimentary beverages per person for up to 2 people in the morning.  We got real used to hot cocoa and OJ for breakfast.  They were always right on time.  They also give you these weird little shots of some kind of smoothie that my hubby loved but I thought smelled like clay so I wasn't touchin' that stuff!  So the free program was MORE than worth it!  We also got the parking included package which I think runs between $179-$229 at the time of reviewing depending on the time of year you book.  (We paid the high end because we were there at Christmas)  It was really nice to not have to worry about self parking and we only used the car one time while there and all was well with the car.  No extra miles put on the car ala Ferris Bueller!",4
1480,"I'd definitely go back and stay here again! This place is so convenient, especially the location from the hotel to the stores, restaurants, and districts were just so close together.",5
1481,"I didn't actually stay here but I dog sat for the last few days for an adorable little pup while her mom and sister took in the sights of our beautiful city. This was a great hotel complete with extra friendly staff, super clean rooms and when a hotel is dog friendly how can they not be good? The lobby smells terrific too, it could be the yummy candles burning when you first walk in that automatically put you in a soothing state. My clients told me that they would be back because they had such a great time so I gave the The Omni a star from them too.",5
1482,"This hotel was comfortable and accommodating when I recently stayed on business travel. Though I will keep this hotel in my B-list and use them again if my other options are unavailable, I do feel there are hotels of comparable quality for less money within a block or two.",3
1483,"The Omni is a very pleasant hotel that is sort of on Michigan Avenue. Its main entrance is actually around the corner on Huron, but its feature restaurant 676 (formerly Cielo) faces onto busy Michigan Avenue. The rooms are like mini-suites so they are sizeable and comfortably furnished.",4
1484,I went here for a wedding and I was so impressed. The food was great and the banquet hall was gorgeous. Everything was so beautifully decorated and arranged and the service was great.  This is really a wonderful place to have a wedding reception!,5
1485,"The Omni is geared toward business clientele.  It's all meat and potatoes, and very squared away.  Service is impeccable.  I was particularly needy when I discovered that I had lost my driver's license immediately after checkout.  Three staffers checked everything, including the cleaning people who by then had moved on from my room to another floor.  One evening, we had martinis in the onsite resto 676, which proved sophisticated and fun. On the down side, I would have been happier if our suite was not looking directly into new construction, or if the check-in people had alerted us to this detail.  But good for you, Omni, for finding great real estate right on the Miracle Mile.  It was a confortable two day stay, but as a leisure traveller, I will venture out to another property when I get back to Chicago.",3
1486,"This was another deal snagged by boyfriend on Priceline.  The hotel was very centrally located and everyone working there was extremely nice.  We had a room perfectly suited for 4.  Two of us got the closed-off bedroom and the other two got the (comfy) sofa bed.  The flat screen tvs were a great addition to our room.  Although the room itself wasn't too spacious, it was perfectly fine for our 3 night stay.",4
1487,This place is PIMP!,5
1488,"I loved this hotel.  Very spacious, comfortable, and clean.  We were lucky to be given a top floor room with great views of downtown and michigan avenue.  I especially appreciated the seperation of the living area from the bedroom with french doors.  Each area also has a door to the bathroom and the living area has a flat screen tv and a wet bar.  I was told all rooms at the Omni have suites this.  Unfortunately, we were there for a short weekend, two nights.  We ordered room service late night and it was good food.  The lobby is on the third floor and you have to take two seperate elevators to get to top floors from the ground floor.",5
1489,"My boyfriend and I stayed here last summer, before I moved to Chicago.  We were attending a wedding and this was where the wedding party was staying and close to the reception. Our suite was amazing! Two flat screen TVs, giant bathroom and a really cozy bed.  It was very difficult to get myself out of that bed and onto an early flight at O'hare the next day. Because of the wedding we did not get to spend as much time as I would have liked enjoying the expensive and beautiful room. I did enjoy the little time I did spend in the room though!",5
1490,"Very disappointing price/value ratio. Have stayed at Westin River North numerous times and chose Omni expecting even greater luxury and service proportionate to the significantly higher cost. Room was nice but no more special. Internet access was additional $10 per day. We requested a room with a view which they honored but the windows were high on the wall and the view was, well, Michigan Avenue.  Business Center computers were $16 per 15 minutes. Staff was very professional and bar was nice. But overall we didn't have the 4-diamond experience we expected. We will return next time to the Westin and know that we will have a very luxurious stay.  And our view will likely be over the river, Michigan Avenue and Chicago City Center. Always fascinating.",2
1491,"Nothing knockin' your socks off here...great for the business traveler. No, ""Oh Wow"" factor...but pleasant and comfortable, nice, efficient. Great service. The linens and drapery need to be updated, and the constant changing of the elevators can be a little annoying. Overall, ok...won't plan to stay again.",3
1492,This hotel is incredible! We snagged a sweet deal to stay here and paid about $89 a night which is unheard of. The staff is on top of everything and the rooms are spectacular. No complaints at all staying here. They did make an error in charging me during check out but quickly fixed the problem with no problem. Would definitely stay here again.,5
1493,Loved my four night stay in July. Excellent location. We had a king suite and it was clean and comfortable. Join their loyalty program for free drink delivery in the morning. I love this service! Room service & house keeping are friendly. What I didn't care for is that you must enter the building and take it to level 3 to then take another set of elevators to the hotel rooms. I thought the room rate was fair.,4
1494,"Spacious room with 2 tv's.  Middle of the road materials used in the rooms (Holiday Inn level).  Great location. If you're looking for something really nice and don't care about having a separate living room, look elsewhere.  If you want a lot of room to stretch out, this is your place.",4
1495,"Excellent hotel centrally located, with an incredibly professional staff. We stayed here while in Chicago for a convention, and were very happy we did! Our friends stayed at another hotel down the street and were very jealous of our huge quiet room! Why only 4 stars? First night we were awaken by the burning stench of ammonia. The cleaning person and engineer quickly found the cause, the refrigerator had a leak and fixed it! They charge $10 a day for wifi! Really makes no sense to charge for wifi in this day and age! however sign up for their rewards program and its free. Finally we decided that we were going to return to Chicago a few days after we checked out and thought we might as well stay at the omni, however even though we stayed there five nights and paid well over $1,000 they still would only give us the rack rate of $285 on a Saturday night. Oh and when we recieved our bill i saw they charged me to call reservations! Granted it was a mistake and only $.75 but its the principle .",4
1496,"I LOVE the Omni!  Why would anyone choose to stay anywhere else?  Every room is a suite, great location at Michigan and Huron and  over the top service. Join their Select Guest Program (check out the website) and get coupons for 50% off and free upgrades. This is truly one of the most accomodating hotels in the city and once you become a Select Guest and begin visiting there, you get all kinds of nice perks!  I stayed there for a wedding a few weeks ago and for $159 per night had a beautiful Executive suite, received a $25 food and beverage coupon, parking was free as was the complimentary coffee, juice and newspaper delivered to my door!  It just does not get any better than Omni.",5
1497,"Very disappointing stay compared to the Omni in San Antonio. Very inconsistent maid services, sometimes we had new towels, sometimes our bed was made. The concierge knew very little about tours, blues  and how best to get around. We ordered a cheese platter, $18,  so  small it would starve a mouse. A bottle of our own wine went missing out of the room. We got it back, but were then very late for a reservation and there was very little apology and NO compensation for something that should not have happened.",1
1498,"I can't say enough about this hotel.  From the front desk staff to the bartender who made restaurant recommendations AND reservations for us to the way friendly (not to mention hilarious) gal who answers the phone at room service, I don't have a single complaint about this place.   Lovely room, comfy bed/linens, indoor pool & spa and they still have old-fashioned bed turn-down service each night (who does THAT anymore?).  Within walking distance to almost anything.  Everything else no more than a $10 cab ride away.  Worth every penny!",5
1499,"Our stay at the Omni in Chicago was great!  The accommodations and the staff were so right there for you.  We didn't know about the hotels courtesy car which was a plus, the driver Valda Thompson was a safe driver and very knowledgeable about the city and where to go.",4
1500,I go to this hotel every Monday night for my Mary Kay meetings. It has great banquet rooms and the staff is so nice. I really recommend this hotel to anyone who needs somewhere to host a party or function.,5
1501,"Love this Hotel!!! I had spent and evening with a Bachlorette party here years ago and beside the $40 parking fee I loved it so much that I had to return. So just recently my love and I ate at their restaurant. It was super great. Outdoor seating on the river, booth table, great food, and exceptional drinks. I felt fancy and 2 classes above my rank. My fav drink was the tequila martini.....oh la la it was damn good. Best martini I've ever, ever had and I was a bartender. So there. My love had beers and appetizers, I mostly drank my dinner and munched a bit on the meat and cheese platter and shrimp appetizer. The setting is perfecto. Seriously if your gonna bring your date and your A game this is where you do it. This is where the magic can  and will happen. Now it gets pricey but sometimes that's cool with me, with the surroundings and drinks Hotel 71 gives, I'd do it weekly if I could.",4
1502,"We LOVED our room and our stay here at Hotel 71.  The staff was very friendly and we got an upgrade from our regular king size room to a river view.  Amazing view of the Chicago River and Trump Tower across the street.   The bed was really comfortable and the bathroom was awesome.  there was a standing shower stall in our bathroom with a rainfall shower head in it.  It felt like we were at a spa!  We definitely took more showers than we needed to just because the shower was so nice!  There was even a TV in the bathroom and it was nice and spacious in there.  Another great thing about the bathroom was it had a dimmer switch for the lights in there.  What was amazing about this was that my early morning trip to the bathroom didn't end up blinding me when I turned on the light.  I just turned it on just enough to see where I was going and then was able to hop back into bed without a problem. We only stayed one night so we didn't encounter the housekeeping staff at all.  Our room was clean and modern, so no complaints there at all.  Valet parking was quick and easy and the hotel was located close to everything we came into the city for.  For the price and location, we'd definitely stay at Hotel 71 again.",5
1503,"The location is prime. That's one of the biggest things you look for in a hotel when visiting a city for the first time. If you have never been to Chicago & are unsure of what area to stay in (as I was), don't worry, just go with Hotel 71. It is a 5 minute walk to Michigan Avenue. If you go right, you'll hit Millennium Park in 5 minutes. If you go left, you'll hit the start of The Magnificent Mile in about 5 minutes. The further down Michigan you walk, the more upscale the shops become. So yes, the location is prime. However, there are still some negative points worth noting. We stayed in room 2414; it is a corner room with magnificent views. It was also very cold, being as it is April. We blasted our heater full blast, but for the life of us, we could not get warm. I was beginning to think something was wrong with US, until I called the front desk to have someone take a look at our TV because it wasn't turning on. When the repairman came, he fixed the TV and I told him about our heater. Well, he fixed the heater, but then the cold air wouldn't work. Why do we need the cold air after I was just saying how cold we were? Well, we had the corner room with magnificent views, right? Which meant, windows around 3/4 of the room. Although it was cold and windy out, the sun was still shining, so when we would come back to our room in the afternoon, IT WAS BAKING HOT. The windows do not open out (& rightly so, as it is the 24th floor), but with the AC not working either, we had to close the curtains for some relief, which sucked because we did have such a beautiful view. There is a mini fridge under the TV. Perfect for keeping our water cold. It came in handy, too, for our leftover deep dish pizza. But when I called room service to ask for a set of utensils, they refused, saying that they can only bring me utensils if I ordered room service. Well then, why did you give me a damn fridge in the first place? I suggest that any hotel that gives you a fridge in your room should be willing to heat up your leftovers & supply you with utensils. It only makes sense, does it not? Valet is $49 a night. I didn't rent a car, so this didn't bother me, but still, that's a lot, City prices, I guess. What was annoying about checking in though was the nightly incidental charge. I prepaid through Expedia and then called the hotel directly to ask if they required a deposit for incidentals. They told me no. I specifically asked and again they said NO. Upon check in, the front desk tells me there is a deposit of $220, which came out to something like $70 a night. He tells me he cannot take cash for it, it must be put on a credit card. This was incredibly annoying because I did not account for an extra $220 in my travel budget. The clerk kept calling it a ""hold"" but come on friend, let's call it what it is - a fully refundable deposit, granted you do not order room service. Unless you want a fork, in which case you'd have to order room service. Blah. And how come the doorman doesn't open the door??? This is the ONLY hotel I have stayed in where the doorman doesn't open the door. If I have to open my own door, it's because there is NO DOORMAN. They don't even say HI or WELCOME BACK whenever we came back to the hotel. Maybe Hotel 71 should stop by a Kimpton hotel & see how they do things. There's one across the street... But location is prime & the views were magnificent. Free wi-fi, although it was spotty & only seemed to work in the bathroom, but we learn how to pick our battles, I guess..",4
1504,"I stayed here for several days when in Chicago for work a couple years ago.  I was on a high floor and had fabulous views of the river which made for amazing sunrises.  The staff were great, very accommodating, and the rate was reasonable.  The location was also perfect, as we were very close to lots of shopping, restaurants, and Grant Park.  I'd definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it.",4
1505,"The hotel staff was less then helpful, the room was small with a cramped bathroom and the airconditioning didn't work well.  the views were nice and the location is good.  but the little things.  we asked them to put something in the outgoing mail, took over a week for it to be sent. wtf? calling them on the phone results in getting hung up on.  I would stay somewhere else, the cost doesn't metter the quality.  skip it.",2
1506,"A fabulous boutique hotel with unbelievable views and amazing location! My family and I stayed here during Lollapalooza weekend because we had a wedding to attend down the street. A bit pricey, but since almost every room was literally booked downtown that weekend, we decided to go for it.  It was a great decision mostly because we didn't have to drive back and forth between the burbs and city, and the fact that we felt super fancy having an awesome view of the river and Trump Tower. The hotel staff were all very accommodating, and really made us feel welcome. I would wholeheartedly recommend Hotel 71 to anyone that needs a temporary home in our beautiful city!",5
1507,"My boyfriend took me here for one night on my 29th birthday, and we coincidentally got a room on the 29th floor!!  We had a BEAUTIFUL river-view, and just loved our time there... it was more like an apartment than a hotel room, and we enjoyed our time there immensely.  Just a hop, skip and a jump away from Morton's Steakhouse, where we had my birthday dinner.  Would definitely stay here again!",4
1508,"Upon check-in there was a flood above the fitness center. Causing havoc for new arrival guests.  Fitness Center was filled with water buckets.  Hotel staff is not attentive. Front desk concierge blatantly rude when you ask for city directions. You need to figure your own way around town. Don't expect recommendations or directions from the hotel staff. Hotel housekeeping keeps room service trays in hallways for a full day before pick up causing the hall to smell.  Bellhop staff not helpful. Toiletries are not refreshed unless you specifically ask. Toilet water pressure is extremely low. After a two weeks business stay with no other options, I was glad to check out of the hotel.",2
1509,"Great hotel, great location.  stayed here for St. Paddys' day.  The rooms were big and the view amazing, of the river there in Chicago. Positives were the staff, especially the front desk were excellent. Check in was super quick and easy and they upgraded my room to a river view! Room was large, the beds were comfortable. Keurig in the room, TVs were nice, and a big desk. Main complaints were that they weren't serving a breakfast when I was there, only a breakfast buffet which wasn't too bad but was like $22 bucks (I think it being St. Paddys day they had a lot of people taking the day off). Also the Elevators were pretty slow, sometimes waiting 5 minutes. I would stay here again.",4
1510,"There are few things not to like about Hotel71. Fairly unassuming from the outside, the interior is chic but not so much that it loses its warmth.  Its prime location makes it a short walk to Magnificent mile and other places you may want to go.  Within 5 blocks you have access to your own personalized pizza tour as Uno, Due, Giordano's and Gino's East are all easily in reach. Rooms: spacious fantastic view INdividual K-Cup coffee brewer the closet being in the bathroom was a bit weird but it did make for a larger space. Free Wifi. The bar/restaurant at the hotel, Hoyt's is also really good.  They have a very creative menu that is modern American.  Staff are all friendly and professional.  Of course, parking is standard Chicago rates $49 per night.  The only minor drawback was that I did not notice any gift/sundries store, but at least 7-11 is right across the street.",4
1511,"Great location- near Grant Park and Michigan Ave, plus on the river and a few blocks west of the lake.  Great staff- very accommodating!  One of the best fitness rooms in a hotel.  And so appreciate the free wifi.  Unfortunately, hotels are now charging an arm and a leg for that. Would have rated them a 5 if they had a pool/hot-tub and provided more updated bathrooms.  However, I slept well.  They have very comfortable beds.  And I was on the 24th floor. I had a really good view. When I'm back in the windy city I will look to rebook her.  First, I will ask if their bathrooms are updated.",4
1512,"Great location. Clean Room. No Pool, Big Room. Lousy View (City View). Concierge Service Slow. Parking Expensive ($50 per night). Great Rate Via Priceline.",4
1513,"I really enjoyed my stay here.  The entire staff was so friendly, and really went out of their way to accommodate my special request.  I work nights, had caught an early flight in, and was standing in their lobby by 8am.  They gave us an excellent suggestion for breakfast, took our luggage, and called my boyfriend on his cell to let us know they had our room ready (by 10am).  It was a relief to say the least. The bed was super comfy, and we have a great view on the 36th floor.  I guess it was a city view room, but we could also see the river.  The room was super clean and fresh, and I really enjoyed the citrus injected bath products.   The only thing I can fault is how loud the doors are.  They really make quite a loud banging noise no matter how gently you close them, and not everyone is concerned about gentle door closing to not interrupt the neighbors. I absolutely would recommend this to anyone traveling to the area, especially given the location right in the middle of the popular destinations.",5
1514,"We chose Hotel 71 as basecamp for our wedding this past October.  We also had our rehearsal dinner there. First things first, the rooms were very affordable for downtown and were so nice.  Depending on what side of the building you were on (hopefully river side) the views were absolutely amazing!  The beds were plush and comfy, the tub in the bathroom was divine (although this may be only in the suite, not sure) and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality considering the price we paid.  Plus the location is perfect!  It's right on the river, across from the Trump Tower...easy walking to a lot of the loop and near north attractions.  Our guests loved it!   I worked with several people during booking, all of whom were so polite and helpful.  We were actually in one of their suites for the weekend, we used it to get all the girls ready for the reception in and it was plenty big enough.  After the fact we decided to stay an extra night, fully intending to move to one of the regular rooms, but they told us to just stay put in the suite at no extra charge. How nice! The restaurant attached, Hoyt's, is pretty good.  They have a really great mac & cheese with bacon and truffle oil (yum!)  And as a bonus, the bar is open till 2am - which was nice for the wedding party :) We also had the rehearsal dinner here.  I worked with their catering manager, Rebecca, during the whole planning process and she was just wonderful.  She bore with me as I planned remotely, sending runners in to check out the space, and working with me to make the menu exactly what I wanted.  We originally had planned to have it on the 6th floor in one of their newly renovated spaces (which are very nice).  A few days before the event I got a call from her saying that the ballroom space was open and would we like to upgrade...no charge.  The views from the ballroom were absolutely amazing and it made for an unforgettable dinner with all the people who are closest to us! We had an absolutely amazing experience at Hotel 71.  The rooms themselves, the view and especially the service were above and beyond what I could have expected.  I'll never stay at another downtown hotel if I can help it!",5
1515,"Love, love, LOVE this hotel. When traveling to large cities for tradeshows, I'm pretty much expecting higher hotel prices. Still $230/night for what I got was a great deal. Plus, it was on the shuttle route to McCormick Place. The regular rooms were booked and since it was getting close to show time, I upgraded to the junior executive suite for only $20 more a night than the regular room. Couple that with a 20% discount for pre-paying and it was a pretty good deal. Posh interior, working elevators with low wait times and generally really nice looking. The suite had a wet bar and fridge, very nice lounge/desk area, huge sleeping area with chaise lounge and a phenomenal bathroom. Garden tub + seperate shower with rain head - LOVED it. Hotel 71 is close to EVERYTHING. Seriously, the best location. The river is across the street, the Tribune building just to the right and fantastic architecture all around. Nice little restaurant/bar extended off the lobby and an array of food/drink choices all around. The staff was super friendly and my room was fantastic. I will say I can see how others reviewers may be irritated with the thermostat - I had it set on cool for the most part but I'm pretty sure it stayed the same temperature the entire time. It was comfortable for me, but I can how others might find it a bit stuffy. The business center was a little on the small side, but had everything I needed and everything worked.   I'd definitely recommend this place for business or pleasure and will for stay again the next time I'm downtown.",4
1516,"Great location in downtown Chicago's Loop. Right across the street from Trump Tower and on the river, this Hotel has great views. The rooms are clean, well decorated and spacious. Big bathroom, but not much counter space. Comfortable beds. The staff is very nice and helpful. the bar in the hotel is called Hoyt's. the bartenders are awesome and the wait staff is very nice. No breakfast offered at the hotel, but there are good places to eat very close to the hotel. We found a really good rate on http://getaroom.com. I would highly recommend this hotel whether you're staying for a couple days or a whole week.",4
1517,A couple of my buddies were in town for a dudes weekend. Great views just crappy hotel. No fridge in the room meant that we had to re-create prom weekend in filling tubs/sinks with ice to chill our beverages.,3
1518,"The best hotel! The view was ok, but the room & staff made up for it! Very clean, friendly. Right from the first step out of the taxi, bell hop, front desk. Not the first complaint. Close to everything! Would stay here again. We stayed in the jr suite, and had plenty of room. Really loved this hotel. Came into town for a Bears game, close enough a taxi only cost about $6.",5
1519,"Completely new find for me on a recent business trip to Chicago.  On the Chicago River, it has AMAZING views of the river and city at night.  Gorgeous, large rooms, great bathrooms, fantastic decor and a staff that couldn't have been nicer. A fabulous bar inside of the hotel, Hoyt's....not as intimate or cozy as I would have liked, but since I was solo, not as important.  More of a sports bar.  Good calamari. Located on East Wacker, you can get to a lot of really cool places, easily from this location. The modern, warm vibe of the hotel also makes you feel as if you are more important than you really are...:) They let me sleep in til 1:30pm the next day for late check out.  Superb! I'd definitely come back and take in more of the town.",5
1520,"This hotel is in the middle of everything.  One of my gfs and myself went to Chicago on a whim b/c of the Virgin Airlines Groupon and she found a $99 per night Groupon for this place.  Great location, right across from the Trump building and on the river.  It's right off of North Michigan, near the Magnificent Mile and between Grant Park (0.2 miles away!).  It's close to the L line from O'Hare ($2.25 per trip every two hours) or you can walk everywhere.  The corner bakery is several yards down from the hotel and there's a Walgreen's and 7-11 closeby. Bar downstairs, pretty flowers, nice desk people, complimentary internet and biz office for printing out boarding passes, nice waiting area, pleasant door staff.  Would come back!",4
1521,I don't like giving bad reviews.  So i made sure I called back everyday for almost a week.  I did finally get the charger back.   Everyday I called back the front desk would always without fail transfer me to an extension that wasn't setup. After the first or second day you would think someone would send out a memo. The effort it took to get the lost laptop charger back still earns Hotel 71 a low rating.,2
1522,"5 star views. 4 star room. 2 star noise. 1 star parking charge. Spent 2 nights here last week an averall had a very good experience. Let's start with the bad though. I know parking in Chicago sucks, but 45$ a night? Felt like I was just throwing money away. Now the great...got a room on the 37th floor with a river view - spectacular. Great river view-decent northward view - see pics. The location is also great - near the Loop, River North and Mich. Ave. 4 Blocks to Art Institute. The morning noise was pretty bad starting at about 8am. LOUD shuddering construction going on somewhere across the hall. nOt good but we left each day by 10am so not intolerable. Room was $184 a night.",4
1523,"The one and only time we've ever visited Chicago, we stayed here. It was on a recommended hotel list by family of friends who were hosting a wedding outside of town. So glad we picked this place from the list! This hotel is definitely more bang for your buck than most of the hotels in the area that I was also researching. To tip the scales even more in the right direction of price, we booked our stay with a ""Chi-Town City Escape Package"" that the hotel was promoting (now until 9/5/11) and they give... yes give you a $50 gift card + $20 food voucher per day. SCORE!!! Upon check-in, we were handed the gift card. I had to ask about the voucher process a few times, but I finally cleared it up with a staff member in the know and they said the per day food voucher total would be deducted from any food and beverage charges (room service or restaurant dine in) from your final bill. SWEET! * Really friendly staff and speedy check-in. * Our room was really spacious and looked recently remodeled. * Excellent location and views from the higher floors. * They have HBO. * The Keurig coffee maker is a plus! * No pool, but you're a couple blocks away from Mag Mile -- go shop instead! * There was no fridge, but we also didn't think we could ask for one so we didn't. * The AC was a little warmer than we like and there seemed to be no thermostat control, but it sufficed considering it was a muggy 80+ degrees outside the few days we were in town. * Big bathroom, but the tub had seen better days and didn't drain too well. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in the middle of everything and have close access to public transportation.",4
1524,"4.5 I was pretty concerned about my stay after reading unfavorable reviews, but our stay was surprisingly very pleasant! We took advantage of the Groupon offer ($110 a night for a standard 2-queen bed room). The service was fast AND friendly. The location was amazing. The room was HUGEE (for comparison, it was about the same size or even slightly bigger than our 1 bedroom suite at the Intercontinental Chicago). The furnishing was relatively nice too, MUCH better than I anticipated (no ugly yellow checker-board pattern to my delight!) The only minus that prevents this from getting a 5 star is the horribly worn out bathroom. Our room was pleasant, but our bathroom was not. It's extremely old and worn out. Pro: VERY spacious room. You would not find a room this big ANYWHERE in Chicago for this price point. Con: Furnishing may not be up-to-par with other boutique hotels, but I personally think that the very spacious room easily makes up for that. It really comes down to decor VS. space. You could either choose another boutique hotel with amazing decor but small space or Hotel 71 with lots of space and a nice, but not amazing, decor.",4
1525,"Yet another hotel that I booked off of Hotwire. I believe this one I got for around $75 a night. There seem to be a lot of complaints on Yelp about the elevators being too slow. From my experience they were just fine! I never had to wait more than a minute or two, which seems perfectly reasonable. I found the location to be quite convenient for my needs. We were planning on taking the Wendella boat tour, and this was literally across the street. It's a few blocks from a CTA station, but nothing unmanageable by any means. The room was nicely sized, though unfortunately our view was quite lacking. Mostly alleyway, though there was a sliver of a lake view, if I craned my neck just right. The bed was VERY comfortable, and we didn't get any noise from surrounding rooms. Best sleep I'd had in a hotel for quite a while. This hotel doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles. The business center and gym were both certainly lacking. Still, for simply a place to sleep at night, this place was more than satisfactory. I'd never go out of my way to stay here again, but I enjoyed it well enough.",3
1526,"Ok, it gets 5 stars for location, value ($129 Groupon price) and the BEST HOTEL BED EVAH!!! I'm really picky particularly about the A/C issue I've read about... our room has afternoon facing sun and Voila, A/C worked perfectly keeping us at 68 degrees even though it was moderately hot and humid outside.. The gym facility was pretty good too... we worked out at 1PM so was empty, but can imagine prime time can get crowded, but it was good for us... No restaurant in hotel per se, kinda a bar style place, but wife is from Chicago so we drove to Andersonville and had great breakfast up there.. I don't know what they are using for their beds, but we slept fabulously and that is so important... comfy and supportive... The room is very spacious and the bathroom is huge with his/her sinks so no bumping into each other a large tub and separate shower. Bathroom beautifully done in beige/peachy colored marble - nice! That said, I think we paid adt'l $20 for the renovated bathroom :-( Location right on the river, between Michigan and Wabash so shopping and restaurants are nearby... easy to get to, near Lakeshore.. Winning!",5
1527,"I'm not certain how to go about this review...  How about a pro/con list Pros:   nice hotel. I think it was recently remodeled. Nice sized bathroom From the 28th floor the views are nice There is a closet in the bathroom which I find very helpful because I had to leave before my wife and baby son woke up. If you don't have a fridge, they will get you one Great location ... In the heart of the city Friendly staff - they must be trained well with customer service Big rooms Fast elevators Cons: No pool No continental breakfast Small elevators - but they are fast and it really isn't an issue AC is by the window and doesn't cool evenly Pros beat Cons by 4 stars",4
1528,"I treated my boyfriend to a night here to show him my favorite city.  I'd made reservations online, and when we got there, our room wasn't quite ready, but the concierge let us check into an ""executive suite"" so we could get in right away.  He said he hoped we ""wouldn't mind"" the fact that the room was a little bigger and there was an attached conference room.... mind?  Ha!  We got into our suite and couldn't believe how much space there was.  The room was gorgeous, immaculate, stylish, and had THE most luxurious bed linens I've ever slept on.  Outstanding views out of both sides of the building, too.   Nothing like an improptu rendition of ""The Apprentice"" in our boardroom-for-a-night.  I don't think The Donald would have approved of our boardroom demeanor, though... The price wasn't too bad ($200) considering we were right downtown Chicago, within walking distance of Michigan Ave, the river, and Millennium Park.  What a great night.",5
1529,"Yeesh....did not have the best experience with this place.   We kept talking about all those things we needed to do before the wedding, and finding a nice hotel for the night of was one we kept forgetting about.  A Groupon popped up a couple of months before for Hotel 71.  Sounded nice enough for a fine downtown hotel price, so we bought it. The Groupon advised that we not call until the next day to book it.  Fine.  I called around 9:30.  The woman who answered was very rude and already flustered sounding.  So far we weren't off to a good start.   Then about a week later I have a charge on my credit card from Hotel 71 for $250!  In a panic I call and find out the woman had booked my date incorrectly and we were charged the no show fee.  With barely an apology it was refunded - which as everyone knows takes a few days to clear back onto your card.  Lovely when you're paying vendors left and right for wedding stuff.   The week before I called to verify we actually still had a room and we did, so so far so good I suppose. Day of wedding we arrive exhausted around 10:45p.  The front desk staff were super duper friendly and even went out of their way to go find a cork screw for us to open our bottle of wine the caterer had stashed away for us to take!   The room itself was eew.  Leopard print chaise lounge you didn't want to touch.  I didn't sleep a wink that night the bed was so uncomfortable - and considering how exhausted from the whole week of events leading up to the wedding, this was BAD.  I ended up watching the sun come up through the windows of the buildings across the river.  It was bad.   Again though, the staff was super sweet and friendly when we left!  The one redeeming quality about this place were the kind ones working - except for the icky woman on the phone. For our out of town guests that come in through the year I won't recommend this place, unless they can sleep like a rock on anything and don't mind paying a pretty penny for it!",2
1530,"A pleasant surprise, indeed. I have driven, and walked by Hotel 71 countless times- and somehow I always got the impression that it was an outdated hotel in a great location. Well, I was wrong. Very wrong. I had a Groupon to stay at Hotel 71 for less than $100 a night. Quite the feat for this part of town. Given that the rate was so low- I chose to upgrade to one of their King River View Rooms for a few more dollars. An excellent choice as my room was on the 12th floor- and looked right down the Chicago River, and all its bridges- a beautiful view day or night. When I arrived at the hotel- the valet took my car ( a little pricey at $43 but in line with other places in the area) and I walked up to the front desk. The front desk clerk was welcoming and pleasant and had no issue in dealing with my Groupon or the special request that I had of him. You see- I was staying in town to go to a concert and I had a couple of tickets I was leaving for friends at the front desk. Given the value of the tickets and the fact that the concert was that night- there was little margin for error. He said it wouldn't be a problem, they do it all the time and he was right. My friends picked up the tickets with no problem. Nice. My room was large with a plush king sized bed with tons of pillows. The bathroom was also large and came with only a shower- no tub. The amenities were similar to a mid range hotel- nice but not luxurious. The towels functional but not sumptuous. The toiletries fine but not high end. But all in all a good deal for the money all the way around. If you want something to eat there is a cafe on the ground floor and of course room service. All it seemed to be lacking to me was a bar area where I could have had a drink while waiting on a friend of mine. But since the weather was so fine- I wandered across the river and had a few outside at Smith and Wollensky instead. Check out was seamless. The valet brought my car out in less than 5 minutes and I was on my way. But not before thinking was a great deal this hotel is- right in the heart of the city!",4
1531,"Is it wrong to give a hotel 2 stars based mostly on the elevators? I just can't justify 3, although to be fair I guess this should be more like a 2.5, because the room my parents stayed in was nice and pretty big, with a great view. But honestly, with the amount of money they have got to be making, they REALLY need to invest some time and energy into renovating their elevators. First of all, if you can get on an elevator in under five minutes from the time you push the button, congratulations to you! The elevator never, ever, ever came quickly, whether we had called it from the ground floor or the floor my parents were staying on. Even though they have the floors separated into sections, and a couple elevators per section, it doesn't help. One time my mom walked all the way to the end of the hall back to their room, let herself in, and got something she had forgotten -- and this was AFTER we'd already waited 2 or 3 minutes for the elevator -- and when she got back we STILL had another 1 or 2 minutes before the elevator arrived. Second of all, the elevator is S-L-O-W SLOW. I guess this goes without saying, considering how long it takes to arrive at whatever floor you're on, but oh my goodness, it's even more painfully slow than you'd imagine it would be while you're waiting for it. Pretty much every time we rode the elevator DOWN, it stopped at every single floor, and it quickly filled up (because, oh, did I mention the elevators are also pretty small? Cuz they are.) and so the first few people would be able to get on, but by the 3rd stop or so, we'd just be met with exasperated faces and rolling eyes every time the door opened and whoever was waiting for the elevator realized they'd have to wait for yet ANOTHER ten minutes for the next elevator and hope that it wasn't full. Honestly, I can't imagine staying on the mid-range floors, how did they ever get downstairs?! It honestly would have been faster to walk. And the whole experience wasn't MUCH more pleasant for those of us ON the elevator, either, considering how much longer it took to get downstairs. And, last but not least, the elevators are pretty terrifying. I don't know how old they are but I'm going to guess PRETTY DAMN OLD. Other than that, the hotel was pretty good.",2
1532,"How can you people be okay with charging 42.00 a night for valet parking when the room was only 149.00 - That's just straight up mean. Anyways. Besides the stupid parking fees, I was pleasantly pleased with this hotel. For the price it's actually pretty great. We upgraded  (for 50 bucks) to a megasuite which is about 5 times bigger than my San Francisco apartment. It had three flat panel TV's, one of which was in the bathroom. Classy. Make sure you get one of the renovated rooms. They're pretty. I'd stay here again, just not in the middle of winter when the temperature is oh 10 degrees. It's not the hotel's fault, but what is that!",4
1533,"I stayed here on my recent trip to Chicago based on the recommendations on several yelpers when I asked for a modestly priced boutique-style hotel in a good location. Things that I liked: * Check in took like 4 seconds.  I hate it when the person checking you into the hotel spends like 5 minutes pecking at their computer and making faces to try and check me in.  This was the way it's supposed to be.   * Large room.  Lots of space to spread out and a large window bringing in lots of natural light. * Location.  I had several meetings around Chicago, and because the weather was nice, I was able to comfortably walk to just about everywhere from here. Things that could have been better: * No one serviced my room during the day until it was too late and I was back to my room late in the day.  No biggie, for me, but a bit surprising. * I had to ask 3 times to get a smaller pillow.  They set me up with these gigantic pillows (who sleeps on those?) and I requested a smaller one for my 2nd night but it was like pulling teeth to get it. * They tried to overcharge me when I checked out.  Probably an honest mistake, but if I hadn't looked at my bill, it would have set me back an extra 50 bucks.",3
1534,"This place is kind of the worst.  Maybe I'm a little too posh, but, here goes: 1 - Ambiance: Lobby was playing Fox News when I checked in.  What kind of hip hotel plays Fox News? 2 - Poor Reservation system: The room for which I had to **pre-pay** was sold out, so I had a choice of either downgrading at ""no additional charge"" or upgrading for $30 a night extra.  Oh yeah and I went from a river view to the view of an alleyway, and a room next to the elevators. 3 - Ambiance, again: Pretty beat-up hallway, terrible insulation between rooms and halls 4 - Amenities: No bottled water in the rooms, either for free or via mini-bar.  If you need water, you need to drink tap. 5 - Amenities: No bathtubs. 6 - Amenities: Linens are 100% polyester. 7 - Amenities: No blankets or duvets.  Even in the summer, offer a duvet.  (PS I can't believe I am considering warmth, kind of at the base of my hierarchy of needs, an ""amenity"") 8 - Ambiance: Poor-fitting bathroom fixtures (with an inch gape between the shower faucet and the tile, you can just imagine all the water damage and toxic mold waiting to grow. 9 - Amenities: No wireless. In other words, don't let the website fool you.  Not in the same league as W or Kimpton.",2
1535,This hotel is wonderful. We had a great experience with the front desk and they even gave us coupons one night for a late dinner. The rooms are fun and somewhat art deco style along with the rest of the hotel. The view was amazing and the rates were very fair. The only thing I have to say is the elevator is a little slow but add character to the place. We plan to be back.,5
1536,"The staff was very pleasant and the location was nice; however our room was very cramped and somewhat awkward.  This could perhaps be because I requested a corner room, but the view was just ok and it was very clausterphobic.  The bathroom was very clean and modern with the stand up shower and rainhead attachment, but it did not overwhelm me.  Don't expect to think you got a great deal with the lower room rate because the cost to valet your car.............$43 dollars/night.  The final complaint is that I am pretty sure I got bed bugs from our bed.  I have what looks like a rash along the upper part of my arm that is driving me crazy.   I do not recommend this hotel at all.",2
1537,"Pros: 1. Great View (especially from the 38th floor) 2. Great location 4. Almost always available 5. Reasonable rates Cons: 1. Loud (especially next to the 38th floor ice machine) 2. Slow internet 3. AC is insufficient, Chicago gets HOT in the summer 4. Rooms are newly remodeled but they clearly kept some of the old stuff.   Not a problem except the desk chair is WAY to low for the desk. An older hotel with a semi-recent remodel, it's a fairly good value for the location.  I could have overlooked the loud ice machine and slow internet, but insufficient AC is a deal-breaker. Try to avoid this place during heat waves. PS.  Free internet is cool, but as a business traveler we would prefer to pay for internet that actually works.",3
1538,"There are some renovations going on right now, so I'd say the experience could be hit or miss.  My recent 5 night stay was a pleasant one overall, but I can definitely see how it can potentially be much better... On the positive side: *  great location - walk to the corner, make a left, cross the canal, and you're in the heart of Michigan avenue with upscale shops and restaurants.  Also close to the El and walking distance to theaters, etc. * nice view (if you're on the right side of the building) - I had a corner unit so I could see the Marina Towers, the Tribune building, the Trump tower (under construction), and up Wacker Drive along the river.  Plus, there was plenty of light so the room felt a little bigger than it was. * good service - got some extra pillows, a loaner umbrella, and a tv fix * surprisingly decent exercise facility and business center - clean, modern equipment with good views.  Both were completely empty all 3 nights I used them. * room amenities - comfortable bed, handy chaise, and Bath+Body Works soap/shampoo/lotion (more of a plus for my wife, but I can appreciate the nice touch too) On the negative side: * room was a bit small and cramped * tv was ancient and didn't work properly * doors slam loudly (I woke up several times at night when neighbors were in and out) * elevators don't give you good feelings * towels were not the cleanest (I'm a little picky on this subject, but consistently found towels that had traces of stains or looked really worn - you can always ask for more) So overall, not bad - I got a great deal on my stay - otherwise I might have given it 3 stars.  Should be better once the renovations are complete.  I'd recommend checking it out after that's done, unless you can get a really good rate.",4
1539,"I stayed in Hotel71 for two weeks over the holidays, and it turned out to be a pretty nice place. My boyfriend and I booked the queen double room with a city view. We chose the double room because it was considerably larger than the single bed rooms and was almost the same price on http://hotels.com. Our room came with two beds, a desk area, a chaise lounge, and a two-part bathroom (one room held the marbled sinks and mirrors, while the adjoining room had the rain shower and bathtub). Our room had plenty of storage space, a huge closet, and plenty of cabinets and drawers to store our belongings. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. We requested a mini fridge and microwave, which were both placed in our room by the time we checked in. The gym in the hotel is very nice with a ton of different machines. The gym also has an amazing view of the city, definitely a bonus while working out. My only complaints have to do with the cable and phone service in the hotel. The cable had a VERY limited amount of channels, about 20. If you're visiting the city for the first time, this won't be a problem since I assume you'll want to go out and about in Chicago and not sit in the hotel and watch tv., but since I am native to the city and stayed in the hotel for 2 weeks, I definitely had down time in the hotel. The no tv. situation was a big letdown for me. Lastly, the biggest problem we experienced was the phone service. The area code for downtown Chicago is 312, while the rest of Chicago is 773. We made a few phone calls to 773 numbers, believing that they would be considered ""local"" and thus be free. This is not the case, upon check out we were handed a bill for over $80 in phone charges. We checked everywhere in the room and welcome book, NOWHERE does it say anything about exorbitant charges for phone service. We called the front desk and explained that they should have posted somewhere about the fees and that we felt misled. They gave us a $40 credit and apologized, blamed the fees on some new phone provider that they are switching to. The credit was ok, but I definitely still feel taken advantage of. My advice if you stay at Hotel71, get a bigger room, it's worth it, and DO NOT touch the phone unless you want a huge bill waiting for you at check out.",4
1540,"I'm not picky about hotels/motels--I've seen my share of holes punched through walls, leaky ceilings, the creative use of duct tape on a front door to make one feel especially secure at night--so when we were planning a trip to Chicago, I was happy to look in the HoJo/Travelodge/maybe-questionable-but-cheap range. And then my sweetheart found some kind of crazy Internet deal for three of us to stay at Hotel 71 for about $80-$90, making my mind boggle when I saw on their Web site that the going range is somewhere in the $200-$250s. Yay. It's huge and modern and the lobby helps you instantly forget the grody motels of travels past--there's art here! And a fireplace! And people at the desk smiling at you, waiting to help! We didn't have any of the mentioned problems re: lackluster desk attendants or elevator slowness, and we were charmed by the size of our room (you could do several cartwheels in both the room and the bathroom!--it was a corner room. Maybe that helped?), quality of the beds, and view. And they have room service that delightfully includes bread pudding ($5!) and sundaes ($6!) that we never got around to ordering. But just knowing it was down there if we wanted it made me sleep a little more sweetly. While there were a few minor bummers (no vent in the bathroom (three people taking showers in quick succession makes things awful steamy), $43 a night valet parking (I know it's the going rate but it bums me out all the same) ), the location and view and overall niceness of the place/lack of duct tape more than made up for it.",4
1541,"This is an oddly mismatched kind of place...many things going for it....and several...well...not so much!   Location: Absolutely Great!  In the Loop at the lower end of Michigan Ave., all the good stuff downtown Chicago has to offer is close by.   The hotel is trying to be an upscale boutique hotel. About half the rooms have been renovated and about half have not.  The rooms are spacious in size, though maybe a little weirdly laid out.  I had a renovated room, which was trying to aspire to the more upscale hotels  but fell short in a few areas.   There is a 32 inch Plasma TV...and a glassed in shower with another TV in the bathroom.  The desk is weirdly tall compared to the chairs if you want to work in the room as I did.   The staff was mostly very helpful, particularly the room service people and the meeting & event people, though the front desk people (although pleasant) seemed a bit clueless about the issues that people had to deal with while I was there.   The biggest issue for me (a business traveler) was that the internet in the guest rooms was down for 5 of the 6 days I was there!  A major inconvenience!  I was amazed that it wasn't fixed within 24 hours.   One of the 4 elevators didn't work the whole time I was there, and the restaurant was closed for renovation, so later guests will hopefully avoid these issues.  Also the doorbell on our room went off for no apparent reason at 4:45 AM several of the nights we were there.  I did see that some people who reviewed complained about noise...Our room was nice and quiet, except for the aforementioned doorbell, which appeared to be an electrical problem, not a prankster. For meetings or events, the Penthouse on the 39th floor is absolutely awesome!!!  I held an event there and it was a great venue, and the staff very helpful.   Overall...a good place to stay....if a little random :)",3
1542,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel last week. Overall, this hotel was just ok.  I give it three starts because it did the job, but I probably wouldn't stay there again when I go back to Chicago. The room was big, it is in a great location, the view was nice, there were plenty of pillows, a spacious bathroom, and the staff was very friendly. What I wasn't too crazy about was of course, like most reviewers mentioned, the elevator.  I mean, come on!!!  There are two sets of two elevators; one set for the bottom half of the hotel and the other of course, for the top half.  You'd think that this would help the situation, but it actually didn't.  I mean, one of our two elevators was out of service the entire time we were there.  Between pressing the button to call for the elevator and getting off at whatever floor we wanted took literally about 8-10 minutes each time!!!  Holy crap, invest some money and get those things fixed.  Did I mention that each elevator can only hold 7-8 people WITHOUT luggage??? Ok, that said, there were just a couple other things that I would have liked different.  For example, they had a coffee maker in the room and gave us coffee packets but no sugar or cream, not even powdered.  The shower had absolutely no water pressure, so it took forever to wash the shampoo out of my hair.  And the hallways were really dismal and depressing looking.  There is also a huge gap between the room door and the hallway, so you might want to put a towel or something down to block out some of the voices, because you can hear every word spoken. I was also disappointed that there was no restaurant/bar in the lobby.  It is actually being renovated, but I knew that before we went on the trip by reading yelp reviews.  :)  They made up for it however, by rolling out a large cart (not as tacky as it sounds) and serving drinks in the lobby. We had a great time in Chicago, and like I said the location was great and we didn't spend much time in the room so the stay was bearable...",3
1543,"Make sure if you stay here you specify a renovated room.  I booked through http://hotels.com which boasted flat screen tv's in every room.  Not ours!  We had an old standard definition tv that was NOT a flat screen.  The decor was awful, didn't match, looked old, the headboard was clearly the result of someone stapling fabric and batting over a piece of plywood and not very well either.   We're from Chicago and I was looking forward to staying here as a relaxing treat prior to the Rock N Roll Half Marathon since my first choice, Hard Rock, was sold out.  It was not the well appointed, modern boutique hotel experience I expected, and to add insult to injury our view was of our first choice hotel! Save your money, our room at La Qunita was way nicer and less money.",2
1544,"The elevators here are the worst.  Is it too much to ask for a semi-intelligent algorithm that knows at least whether you've hit the up or down button? The fitness room is totally sketchy.  The front desk employees tell you which floor it's on, and when you arrive on that floor, there's absolutely no signage.  Not helpful, when the facility is on a floor surrounded by other hotel rooms.  The inside of the room is a labyrinth of randomly placed machines, all pointed in different directions.  The only treadmill is at the very end of the room, facing the window that looks out on the river.  It's a nice view, but I was totally creeped out by the fact that I couldn't tell if anyone was sneaking up behind me while I was on my run. The rooms are a very generous size, but the bathroom was awful.  The water wasn't hot enough for my shower, and I feel that as a 5'3"" woman, I should *not* be able to look out over the top of the shower curtain. All in all, I think I'd actually prefer to stay at the Red Roof Inn next time.  At least they have free breakfast.",2
1545,"I booked this hotel (1 king size bed, city view) through Expedia and managed to get a pretty good deal on it for the dates 12/28/09 - 1/1/10..  A few days later, I found it cheaper on Kayak and called Expedia for their price match guarantee.  I spent over two weeks waiting for them to process my credit before I called to check up.  They told me that the Kayak website did not specify the exact room (i.e. deluxe or not) so they couldn't credit my account.  I argued and ended up with a $50 credit.  Bleh, at least I got something. Anyways, as far as the actual hotel goes, it was better than average but not great.  It felt like a hotel that tried to be modern and hip but wasn't quite there yet.  Service was excellent with nothing to complain about.  Two elevators were available for my floor (they separate it into two halves, each with two elevators) and I never had to wait long.  Most of the time the elevator is already at the bottom waiting for you. Room was nice.  King sized bed was cozy and sheets were adequate.  I love the wireless connection in the room and used my laptop from the bed often.  I wish the TV was upgraded to a flat screen.  I used their business service center to print out my boarding pass the day before my flight and it was easy to do. The biggest downside of this hotel which is enough to dock off 2 stars for me is the bathroom.  First of all, I didn't like how the closet was located in there.  Second, no counter top?!?  All they had was a skinny ledge below the mirror which is barely enough to hold things.  The shower curtains were crimpled and the toilet was horrendous (weak flush and it kept making a pumping noise for a few seconds after you flush).  Tiles were old school and nothing to write home about. Besides the bathroom, everything else was good.  The biggest plus for this hotel is the location.  I found it very convenient to the Magnificent Mile (just a 5 minute walk) as well as the Metro stations. Would I stay here again?  Probably.",3
1546,"I have no complains whatsoever about this hotel.  I wished we were able to do a late check out but that was the only thing they were not able to accommodate us with since they had other tenants coming in that sunday.   They were kind enough to change our reservations from 3 nights to 2 nights since our flight was canceled the night of in Vegas at no additional fee.  This hotel is AWESOME on location!  What more can you ask for since its right at the corner of Wabash and the riverwalk!  You are only about a block away from the bar/lounges area across the river, towards the Trump tower also! The hotel is also about 1.5 blocks away from CTA, if you are thinking about going to the airport.  Very do-able for someone that doesn't like walking either!  We upgraded to a river view deluxe king room, which was totally worth it.  The view was gorgeous and our bed... omg our bed made us not want to go out since it was so COMFORTABLE!  That is the most important thing in a hotel for me, the bed and hotel 71 won me over there.  Our room was more than spacious.. more than we could ask for at the rate that we got through travelzoo.  I was quite pleased.  The hotel itself is a large boutique hotel, with very nice and trendy decor.  They have a large office area for customers to use for internet/printing, large gym, and a restaurant/bar named Hoyt's that is open until about 1am everyday.  When it comes to reading all about the cons from other yelpers, those cons mean nothing to me since we were mainly outside, discovering Chicago, instead of trying to stay in our room.   We were accommodated with VIP Shedd Aquarium tickets, which saved us so much time with no lines from the hotel.. There's another plus. I am more than happy that I stayed at this hotel on my trip to Chicago and I wouldn't mind coming back with its perfect location of the river and magnificent mile.",5
1547,"We had a very nice stay here.  The location is convenient to transit and the Mag Mile.  The rooms are large and clean.  The staff is very friendly, and we got a great price. Also, free internet!  I would certainly return.",4
1548,"This hotel is alright.  It's in a good location if you're looking for a place to crash on a girls night out.  It's clean, the service is friendly, and the rooms are large and nicely decorated, but there's nothing ""special"" about it, ya know?  In the trendy hotel market, I definitely prefer the W, although the prices are much, much lower at Hotel 71 (especially if you check the online hotel brokers). Also, I've stayed here twice and both times booked a ""city view"" room, but was able to switch to a ""river view"" room at check in, for no extra charge.",3
1549,"A nice boutique hotel in the heart of the city.  Location can't be beat, views from almost every room are great, and the staff really make the place come to life.  Everyone from the doorman to the housekeeper was friendly, smiling, and seemed genuinely happy to serve you. I can't talk about the cost, because our room was paid for as part of a wedding party we were attending (thanks, E!), and yes, valet parking is the standard downtown $45-50/day.  So if you're stuck with driving, you'll pay the price. Our room was definitely larger than expected, well-appointed (though my wife thought it was a little dark -- more lamps needed?), and comfortable.  There was a large medical convention group staying there that weekend as well, but despite the hotel being full, our room was always very quiet.  The bathroom was also quite large, but the tub/shower looked like it had seen better days, with the chrome tarnishing and some of the grout starting to flake.  The adjustable shower head was also no longer adjustable. In spite of these small missteps, we loved being able to walk everywhere in the loop, and we loved the cheerfulness of the front desk folks every time we returned for the night.  It felt like our personal urban oasis.",4
1550,Stayed at Hotel 71 last weekend and had a really nice time. They upgraded us to a river view room since we were only staying a night. Very nice! The rooms are very sizable and have great amenities. I particularly loved the shower (overhead). The only negative I encountered with Hotel 71 is parking. Not surprising due to its awesome location. Parking is expensive and you cannot get your car on demand. For me it wasn't a big deal. There are a lot of parking options (and much cheaper!) if you're willing to walk a couple blocks.,4
1551,"Large spacious rooms, beautiful views, but sort of ghetto-ish that they TAPED plastic insulin covering the windows. i expect better than that from a boutique hotel. they have free wireless which even palmerhouse or the W don't offer for free which is nice.",3
1552,"Won't be coming back here. They did not have the king size non smoking room available like the reservation (made months in advance and) stated they would honor. However, they did have ""lake view"" rooms available that fit that description if I wanted to pay for an upgrade. Our choices were a king size in a fully smoking floor. Who has fully smoking floors these days? Or a room with two smaller beds. They did not offer up to check if a king non smoking would be available the following day or two either. Lights out and a clogged bath tub in our room as well. Definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. I'm positive that there are many hotels in the area that have similar deals which are much nicer and have better customer service.",2
1553,"I'm a little biased on this review, because my wife and I have been spoiled at other hotels we have stayed at.  Not that Hotel 71 is terrible, they just don't measure up to some of the other hotels we have stayed at such as the Westin and our new favorite, Hotel Monaco.  One thing that is important to us is a great view, which Hotel 71 has, but the other hotels we have stayed at have a place at their windows where you can lounge and just relax and enjoy the view.  You have to stand and stare out the window at Hotel 71.  I know I'm being picky, but you would be surprised how nice it is after walking around all day in Chicago and to be able to kick back and just watch either the city lights or the river (Hotel Monaco actually has a little lounging area built into all their windows - very nice).  Also, the walls must be super thin, because we heard our neighbors, talking, not shouting, until 2:30 in the morning!  On the plus side, the rooms were clean, but are starting to show wear, which is ok.  I know hotels can't stay pristine forever, but I just haven't seen this at our other favorite hotels. They also need to have in-room safes.  This is pretty standard in hotels now, so I was surprised we didn't have one in our room. On the plus side, their personnel are very friendly and do their jobs well.  Good customer service is important to me and this is why I'm giving Hotel 71 3 stars.  I think Hotel 71 is a nice hotel, but there are other hotels in the area that are better, at least in my humble opinion.",3
1554,Hotel 71 is on the river within close proximity to the Miracle Mile and Millennium Park. I liked the modern contemporary style of the hotel and staff are very friendly and helpful. I had a river view room which provided a magnificent view of the river and skyscrapers of downtown Chicago. The room itself was large with an amazing bathroom. The shower had one of those giant shower heads directly overhead. Also the bath is separate which was perfect after a long day at the conference. I ate a couple of time in the cafe and had the Cesar Salad. It was very fresh with full slices of Parmesan cheese over the top. I would recommend staying at Hotel 71 if you are looking for a place in downtown Chicago.,5
1555,"Nice decor, but looks so much better on the website. We were placed on the 16th floor directly RIGHT next to the elevator. The next morning we were woken up by drills, hammers, etc. They were doing maintenance on the elevator. I asked for a different room, therefore we were downgraded to the 15th floor. Should be the other way around right? We couldn't even move into that room until 9pm the second night. This place is a GREAT location, Nice views, but the rooms were just okay as well as the service. Also waited 45 minutes at Hoytt's for 2 beers, we even sat at the bar!. Of course making us late for our flight. We had to run though the airport to catch it... I wouldn't stay there on our next visit to Chicago..... wouldn't recommend it either",2
1556,"My Friend's Bachelor Party Review #7 Considering the prices of all the places nearby, this place is a spectacular deal. $350 for a suite to house 6 unforgivably drunk 20-somethings comfortably, giving enough room to sprawl out, pass out, and play game of asshole until the former occured. The views of the river were spectacular, and the interior was extremely well appointed, with the exception of a small couch which didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the plush decorations. A few knocks were a gigantic walk in closet which really would serve no purpose unless and extremely compulsive packer stayed here. And the lack of a fridge or ice machine, maybe it was best there wasn't a mini-bar, but c'mon, the beer was getting warm. Did we deserve a place this nice? Can I really write a review based on the purpose I used the place for, a drunken crash pad? Probably not. But I think this a great relatively cheap spot for anyone who wants to stay downtown",4
1557,"I really liked this place. Got a great rate here, and was slightly skeptical as most ""boutique"" hotels I've stayed in tend to favor style over substance. The hotel is in a great location, the staff was friendly and helpful and the interior was stylish without being gaudy. Used the workout room which was modest, but adequate and had a great city view. The room I stayed in was very large (another rarity with boutique hotels), the TV and cable options were slightly below average, room had a great city view. Bathroom was also spacious and nice. Had one incident with the hot water being too hot in the shower and a staff member was sent up almost immediately and fixed the problem within 5 minutes, and was very friendly. Overall a pleasant experience and I would definitely recommend it, especially in the $100-200 per night price range.",4
1558,So they made it write - i got a call from the reservation manager and she apologized for the slew of unfortunate incidents and gave me a bit of a refund. i do like that they called me back and took it my complains seriously. says a lot about a business. i would now consider staying here again. Thanks.,3
1559,I was more than happy about my stay at Hotel 71. I know what some of the reviewers are complaining about because the first room I was assigned to was horrible. The internet didn't work and the bathroom looked a little worn (toilet made noises and the shower looked outdated). I called to complain about the internet connection so they moved me right away to a different room. The new room was the jackpot. Pros: - free internet - VERY spacious room and even more spacious bathroom - the bathroom was the cleanest and most modernized bathrooms I've seen that wasn't in a 5 star hotel (there was a flat screen in the bathroom). - good location. I was able to walk to most anywhere I needed to go along State St and Mich. Ave. Cons: - not the best view I would definitely stay here again and make sure that I stay in one of the renovated rooms.,4
1560,"Absolutely loved this hotel. Great service, GREAT location I have been to many places and this hotel had one of my favorite views of all time. Suite was very large with nice office area.",4
1561,"I booked a room at this hotel prior to reading the reviews and was a little nervous rolling in. I have no idea what half of these reviews are talking about. Parking: its downtown Chicago, deal with it. Every hotel I have stayed at downtown charged at least $35 a night, so they aren't out of line. I stopped by a few self parks near by, and there was almost no savings, so I just valeted every night. Plus you get in and out. Elevators: Either they changed this problem, or other people stayed at a different hotel then I did. It was a concern of mine after reading the reviews so I made sure to time them. The longest wait I had was 45 seconds. They had 4 elevators 2 serving the first half and 2 serving the other. It worked well. Rooms: Mine I believe was an older one. It was still clean, fairly updated, and without any complaints. My view was of some surrounding buildings and a bit of Michigan Ave, but I didn't care. The location is stellar (within a short walk to every el line in the city), and the price is right. If you're not a chain hotel points whore or some super high maintenance jerk,  you should have no problem staying here.",4
1562,"I love this hotel -- even though the first time I stayed here, I rolled off the bus, hungover and half-awake into a very dark lobby and couldn't find the right elevator to get to my room... It's a cute boutique hotel on Wacker on the South side of the river, but close enough to everything downtown (Miracle Mile... Navy Pier, blahblahblah).  It's also in close proximity to the El so getting to Northern neighborhoods (i.e. Wrigleyville, Boystown -- Halstead) is easy enough.",4
1563,"Seriously someone needs to smack the hell out of me for forgetting to share my/our experience here. My memory really sucks! Okay so I booked a last minute room here for a getaway weekend with my guy during March I believe ( ..) (.. ) I forget which month and am too lazy to go and pull up my statement to see......so ANY-way, lol. I got here on a Friday afternoon and much to my surprise the Hotel was actually awaiting my arrival - many hotels I have been to here have always had me waiting for my room to be ""ready."" It was clean and very contemporary yet dark in the lobby. The bellhop was awesome although he gave me a heads up on the slow elevators I was extremely shocked to wait literally 8 minutes for the ONE elevator to SLLLLOOOWWWWLLYYY come down to take us up to the room. The elevator itself took away alot of our motivation out that weekend when deciding where and when we were going anywhere. The room, checking in everything was as pictured however I did for some odd reason think that paying 249.00 a night would have gotten me a little more square footage especially since I upgraded the room to a River View. It really made me wonder what a ""normal"" room size was. The best was the view and the bathroom! I loved it. However by Saturday morning we were callling the front desk thirty times about housekeeping coming to atleast remake the beds and bring tissue to the room! I mean we left that morning at 9:00am and came back at 7:00pm to find our room just as we had left it and without any TISSUE! do you know how frustrating it is to have your body wait for tissue! Although the experience wasn't as great as I wished it would have been considering the very large bill I had to flip, there were little things like the location, valet/parking and view  that earned the stars Edit**** I forgot the convenient bar downstairs in the lounge area....its an hotel employee but they have all the alcohol you can take, you can drink in the lounge and watch the flat screen or take the drinks up to your room! One more star for the alcohol!",4
1564,"This is a very pleasant hotel, though it's not the most 'sought out' hotel in downtown Chicago. The staff there is great and I didn't encounter much difficulty checking in, getting my room or ordering when it came to dining at the hotel's restaurant located in the lobby. Price wise, this place is superb. Good deal. The rooms were super spacious and had nice contemporary decor. I had a basic suite with a king-sized bed. The bathroom was a girl's dream, being that it was spacious and included a sliding door closet. Wacker St., where the hotel is faces, offers a great view of the skyscrapers and the waterfront. During my stay, I was lucky enough to see the set-up of the filming of 'Transformers 3,' so this hotel was quite popular then. Wi-fi is also included at this hotel.",4
1565,"I stayed at the hotel last year for a business trip. It was also my 1st time in Chicago. I kinda like the hotel tho. The good: The hotel is clean, decor are not bad, located right off public transportation, downtown setting, great view from my room (don't know if this goes for all rooms), closed to everything with walking distance. The bad: Lobby is kinda small. The people talking next door and I could hear. (thank god I didn't hear anything 'else' at night.) Hooking up internet was a pain. Overall, i would go back again.",4
1566,"In my opinion, Hotel 71 Chicago is probably one of the best places to stay in the area.  Located downtown and in the heart of the city, Hotel 71 is close to everything.  I especially am impressed with the high level of customer service and attention to detail.  It's nice to be greeted with a sincere smile in a big city like Chicago.  I hear the Hotel is opening up a fabulous new cafe, which will be terrific because the hotel is so close to the River.  Equally, there are plenty of great restaurants around Hotel 71, including Mortons and Corner Bakery. Make sure to ask the hotel staff about Windella river cruises, which are a stones throw away from the location. Equally, the decor of the hotel is fabulous, with an ultra-modern lobby, full of trendy pictures and lighting.  Chances are, you won't even need a cab to get around because Hotel 71 is so close to everything. Situated right on the Chicago River, and a block away from the magnificent mile, it's easy to spend a whole afternoon just people watching.  I highly reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for an upscale, classy hotel with affordable pricing in the windy city.",5
1567,"4 stars for the location.. In the heart of downtown, right by the River and Trump Tower, near Michigan Ave and the Bean at Millennium Park! Too bad didn't get around, was on a business trip.. The room was clean, although the bath tub wouldn't drain. I'm not the complaining type so I just left a note to housekeeping and they had it fixed the next day. Room service was very good. Had an awesome Chicken Salad sandwich with a side of fresh fruit salad. In the morning, the good ol' egg white omelet with side of fresh berries oatmeal. The room was also quiet (maybe because I was on 28th floor!) but there is plenty of action if you have time to check out the city.",4
1568,"Stayed here for the Chicago Marathon. We were allowed to check in early and assigned to a fantastic room with tons of space and a SPECTACULAR view. The bed is awesome, pillows were not my style but comfy enough - other hotels are worse! The staff is VERY friendly and helpful. You need toothpaste? they have it, shaving cream? got that too. There were a few hiccups (Marathon related) but nothing significant to really complain about. When I go back to Chicago, I'm staying here again!!",4
1569,"First thing I noticed when I entered the room was how large it was. Not a typical downtown, cramped room. Great location. Helpful friendly staff, nice small ""mini bar"" downstairs. Meeting space upstairs is wide open, full of glass and unique. Also told it was ""Batman's Bedroom"" in the Dark Knight.",4
1570,"Hands down one of the nicest hotels in Chicago I have ever stayed at.  Service was wonderful, location is great!  Room was so comfortable, and had a wonderful view of the Chicago River, workout area very modern with a great view.  Would stay here over and over!  No reason not to come back.  Price was not bad either for Chicago, but we did book on Hotwire.",4
1571,"Spent 4 nights here on a business trip. Outstanding hotel. Extremely nice, new, and spotless. Helpful staff and great view from my room. Will go back.",5
1572,"I've stayed here twice.  First time, I fell in love.  It was December, cold and the hotel was sexy warm.  I opened the drapes and fell in love with the view and moonlight shining into the great room.  Room was quiet and bathroom was luxurious.  I had a big FUN king size bed.   Second time, I booked through a website.  I stayed on the 26th floor, not updated room and no real view.  I was close to the elevator and the bed was ten feet from the door so I could hear people discussing everything.  I again was dead tired and could have upgraded to another room on the water side for $15 after I talked to the front desk.  But I decided to just get dinner and call it a night.  So they would have accommodated me.   So if you book, check where the room is and etc.   I love the area and the whole downtown Chicago vibe.  Of course, parking is expensive but that's norm for any big City downtown stay.  You are fairly close to the West Loop and other great areas that has some very hip lounges and eateries.   I will stay there again when I return but will just be sure that I get the updated room side of the hotel.",4
1573,"If nothing else, this hotel was located in the PERFECT location for visiting/tourist-ing Chicago, and our river-view room had an amazing view. We got to the hotel, and we were actually able to check in about 4 hours before the 3pm check in time, which a huge positive! The space of the room was ok. Nothing special, definitely not boutique-like, as I was hoping it would be. The interior reminded me more of a Holiday Inn than of a hotel that...well, charges as much as this one does. The room size was perfect, even roomy I would say, for 2 adults, while the bathroom size was pretty standard. I know there are some complaints about the elevators, but we were on the 28th floor and had no problem at all. From the lobby, we actually didn't have to wait for one the whole time we were there, and anytime we needed one from our floor, we didn't wait longer than a minute. My biggest complaint was that every single night we stayed there (3 in total), I was woken up by noise in the hallway. Once from noisy elevator traffic and the other two times from a group of drunken girls yelling on the floor. As an NYC native, I have no problem sleeping through noise, and I actually brought/slept with earplugs in all nights, so I think this is really a testament to how thin the doors are. My only other big issue was that the bed was quite uncomfortable. I mean, when I'm traveling, I'm really paying for two things: a bed and good nights sleep; and this hotel couldn't meet either of those. Lucky for them, their location bumped up their rating from 1 star to 3. In all, if you can get a good deal on hotel71, then it might be worth the stay here. If you are a tourist like I was, it more than likely is worth the stay. If you end up having to pay full price, you may be disappointed.  Oh, and if you do end up booking some nights here, make sure to request a room on one of the higher floors.",3
1574,"Meh.... Lobby is small. Hotel is kinda classy from the outside. Staff was very friendly. View was beautiful. The room was ok, just not as super spectacular as I was expecting for the location price etc. The rooms kinda look like it was an office building that had been remodeled so the closet  was in the bathroom, a little weird but whatever. Decent stay but did not blow my mind",3
1575,"The views from this hotel are phenomenal. I took a lot of pics that I want to get blown up now. The hotel is located right in front of the Riverwalk near the water. You can see all the bridges at night it's so beautiful. The room was good. Flat screen TV, nice bathroom and very large windows. I did have trouble with the TV. It seems that it wasn't plugged in properly and we went without it for a day. Who needs TV when you are on a vacation? They don't have a pool so leave your trunks and bathing suit at home. Bring a laptop cause each room has FREE WI-FI.... That is not a typo!",4
1576,"Even though I live in Chicago, I thought a night away from the house on Valentine's would be romantic.  I chose the Hotel 71 for the proximity to the restaurant we were having dinner at, the price and the view of the Chicago River.   The rate of the room was very competitive for the area ($169/night) and the view of the river was great, but I was very underwhelmed with the room overall.   Its my understanding that they are in the middle of renovations and our room had not yet been upgraded and it was VERY obvious.  The porcelain in the tub was peeling, the closet door was off the hinges, and there was a gaping whole in the entertainment center where we expected the minibar to be.   The overall decor of the room is also the antithesis of romantic.  The comforter and curtains are an ugly brown gingham and they clashed terribly with the leopard-print sofa, which would have been awful all on its own. Service was also lacking.  The bar was small and indescript.  There was no ice bucket in the room and we had to call down for one.  And though the hotel seemed far from full, we were given a room RIGHT NEXT to the elevator. This hotel would be sufficient for a business traveler on a budget, as its near The Loop and the Magnificent Mile. But it is NOT a good selection for a romantic getaway.",2
1577,"I am torn between 3 and 4 stars for Hotel 71.  First of all I think the Lobby should be so much bigger than it is.  It's quite small and when there are people checking in/out it gets super crowded.  Uncomfortably crowded, especially when everyone is lining up for the elevators in this little nook.  But other than that it's very trendy and the staff is nice.  Great location but there are so many other wonderful hotels in the area.",3
1578,"We held our wedding at Hotel 71 this past July, and we could not be more pleased. Now that the renovations are complete, the hotel is beautiful and suited our needs perfectly. We chose Hotel 71 based on the penthouse city views-- which are amazing. The majority of our guests also stayed in the hotel, and we received several compliments regarding their arrangements. Rebecca Lachman, the coordinator for the wedding is very professional, and helpful and did an excellent job ensuring that our wedding day was perfect and put together.",5
1579,I used to live in Chicago a couple of blocks from this hotel and every time I come back to visit I try to stay at Hotel 71. Their amazing views of the Chicago river and the city bring back so many memories. And I love that they don't have mini bars -- this helps prevent accidents when this sugar cravings creep up.,5
1580,"We got in really late but there was still someone there to check us in. He put us at a room next to the elevator which was not the greatest so i'm giving it a 4 star. And the shower head was contemporary and all but it was an overhead shower. I felt like i was forced to shower and wash my hair. It was like an overhead waterfall. I wish there was a bathtub it being the king view room. We had a great view, grand comfy bed, and even bath and body soaps, lotions, shampoo and conditioner! There was also free wifi , and a nice flat screen on the wall. I am surprised it's a 3 star hotel, it really should be higher!",4
1581,"I would very highly recommend weddings at Hotel 71.  Rebecca will handle everything.  We had an unbelievable amount of people tell us it was the best wedding food they'd ever had.  The views are amazing.  The room is smaller so it has a less capacity than most places but if you're having a wedding of 100 people or so, it is the best venue in the city.  I could not be happier with how our wedding turned out and the service was wonderful.",5
1582,"I want to give Hotel 71 more stars, but I just can't.  The location is great, the view from our room was nice, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.  After that it goes downhill. We were given a king bed when two doubles were requested, though a discount was given, it was still an inconvenience.  The room was oddly shaped leading to a lot of unusable space.  No mirror except in the bathroom.   And the bathroom is a whole other issue.  I think the rest of the hotel was recently renovated, unfortunately our bathroom had been overlooked since 1970.  The dingy & stained bathtub was chipped, grout was filthy, lighting was terrible and there was no exhaust, so putting on makeup was next-to-impossible.   Hence the 3 stars.",3
1583,"this place is SICK. whoever designed this place put a lot of effort into it and it shows. you could say that this place is gay since it's so nice, but i don't think you can have a gay hotel (maybe you can, but it's not like every room only has king beds in them) we got a great room on the corner of the building with an amazing view of the river and downtown chicago. the location is great, the rooms are big and very well done up. for a place this nice it's not too pricey, and you can walk to House of Blues to hear great music. i think the only place with more class is the W, and that is always $300+, so if you want a great place to stay in chicago, try the 71.",5
1584,"my friend from HOT-lanta stayed here while she was interviewing for jobs. pretty darn posh. i am happy to say that her 'rents were picking up the tab. if i was not forking over the dough, i'd stay there every night. very classy art deco style and nice rooms.",5
1585,"I'll keep this short.  The location is good, the rooms are a mixed bag, and the elevators add ten minutes to any trip outside your room.  Additional annoyances are the cleaning personnel knocking on my door at 8am, and the bathtub barely draining.  Not a good value.",2
1586,"This is the fifth time that we have stayed in this hotel, we love it. The staff is amazing, the views are even better! There is no other place that one should stay when in the windy city.",5
1587,"Nice enough hotel I guess...but...and this is a big but, when we made our reservation we requested a crib, no problem....until we arrived and expected a crib, because we were told no crib available. Do our 14 month old did not enjoy his stay, nor did we. We will not be coming back.",2
1588,"My husband and I hosted our October 16, 2010 wedding ceremony and reception at Hotel 71.  This review is of the hotel as a wedding venue, although the rooms are also lovely.  The greatest asset to hosting our wedding at Hotel 71 was Rebecca, the Conference Services Manager.  She was prompt, professional and lots of fun to work with.  My husband and I weren't very knowledgeable about weddings prior to the planning process, and Rebecca was very quick to respond to inquiries and find answers for us.  She always had great suggestions and helped us structure the entire event so that everything went smoothly.   The venue itself is beautiful.  Weddings are hosted in the 39th floor ballroom.  The room has tons of windows with gorgeous views of the city.  My husband and I were looking for a venue that was modern, urban and quintessentially Chicago, and Hotel 71 definitely fits that description.  The location and views really can't be beat.  Our ceremony was held at sunset and the reception started later that evening.  The lighting and scenery really helped create a beautiful event.   Our guests loved the venue and we are still getting tons of compliments more than two months later.  Thank you so much to Rebecca and Hotel 71 for helping us put together such a memorable day!",5
1589,"I just returned to LA from Chicago and stayed at hotel 71.  The service was outstanding and the feel of the hotel is energetic and loungy without being pretentious. I highly recommend it I you are looking to stay downtown-the views, restaurant and gym are fantastic too!",4
1590,"are you kidding me? we stayed here for three nights in the recent jaunt to CHI this early Oct to check out the new Piano Addition at the Art Institute. this hotel has got to have the best river and skyline views in all of chicago! and what a location: one isliterally at the midpoint of ART [AIC]  and shopping [magnificent mile] i've stayed at Ritz's and Crillons yadda yadda and one does not expect the same lux here so for what it is- a room with a view for just over a hundred clams-it's perfect, its cozy, it's central. and if you happen to stay over the weekend and you have one of them river views, be sure to get up and watch the yacht regatta that literally stops traffic as the bridges open up to let them thru!. By itself that show is worth half the room costs! ;-)",5
1591,I stayed at Hotel 71 in November of 2008 for a few nights with the girls. The hotel was very nice. The wi-fi worked well. The room was spacious and fit 4 ladies comfortably. It was so cold outside that we were able to chill a bottle of sauvignon blanc on the window sill! But the room was nice and toasty! The view of the river was outstanding. We were within walking distance of many places. Great location!,4
1592,"If not for check-in, I would have given my experience at Hotel 71 five stars.  The premium room was great for what we paid, stylishly furnished, comfortable, quiet, and with an amazing bathroom (seriously, can I take that back to Boston with me??).  The location could not have been better;  we bought 3-day CTA passes and barely used them since we could walk almost everywhere.  Prompt and friendly housekeeping and a fantastic 12th-floor river view were icing on the cake and even the elevators were never a problem (!!). Now for the bad part: check-in.  I'm relatively young already and look even younger, which I think wrote ""take advantage of me"" on my forehead.  When we checked in, we were asked if we'd reserved a premium room with one king, to which I responded no, we'd requested two queens (I was traveling with my brother).  He paused for a minute and told us he'd given us a city view and sent us up to the room.  Well, it turns out he'd given us a standard city view (which wasn't even available on Expedia, but we booked anyway since we got a deal on the premium room).  At first I thought I wouldn't complain since it was probably because they'd gotten the wrong information from Expedia, but I looked up the price difference ($70 per night for four nights) and marched back downstairs, determined either to get the premium room we'd paid for - or at least a standard river view - or to receive some sort of compensation.  Another staff member was very friendly and apologetic and put us in a premium room.  Halfway there, I realized I hadn't mentioned needing two queens and, lo and behold, there was only one king.  I elected my brother to go down to the concierge this time and they finally put us in the room we'd requested: a premium river view with two queens.  Since the room we'd originally reserved was obviously available, I'm not sure why they didn't just put us in it in the first place. That being said, Hotel 71 was indeed a great place to stay in Chicago.  If you can, stay in a premium room.  There is a BIG difference, and I should know!",4
1593,"Formerly the Executive Plaza, the Hotel 71 (named after its numeric address on Wacker Drive) has a nice location along the bend of the Chicago River. This makes the rooms on this side much more desirable than the ones on the opposite side, which looks over an alley and assorted buildings. The standard rooms are very sizeable and comfortable here. I hear there is a plan to convert this property soon to a combination condo-hotel tower.",4
1594,"Location and view were top-notch, and the lobby at 71 was impressive. Staff was very kind and helpful. However, the facility leaves much to be desired. The large rooms are oddly shaped, leaving lots of space strangely unused. The furniture was a bit dated. Walls are PAPER thin; you can hear all sorts of noise coming from the hallway. Staff put us next to the Fitness Center, which also caused all sorts of noise. Doubt I'd go back for the price.",3
1595,"Stayed here over the weekend for the Flyers game. Even though the hotel is undergoing renovations, it is STILL beautiful. Staff were great especially putting up with my constant bothering to get up to the penthouse (aka Bruce Wayne's place in TDK). I plan to go back when the hotel is finished.",5
1596,"This is a super spot to take some down time in Chicago. It is trendy but way more livable then the W. The gift shop has really fun stuff, I mean gifts people would actually want. Great Location and a very affable staff.",5
1597,"This was my hotel for NYE.  I had a comp room, due to a previous issue and them having to ""walk"" me to another hotel.  Overall, it was OK, but only after they moved us to a suite after initially wanting to put us in a room that hadn't been renovated.  When I explained that we had the free stay due to an earlier problem, the desk guy upgraded us to the suite (much to the dismay of the guy who was checking in next to me-  he was told that even though he had reserved a suite on Expedia, there were none currently available.  The suite had a spacious living room, with a large TV, desk and sitting area.  There was a non-working refrigerator in the ""hospitality"" area and a microwave.  There was no ice machine nearby (not good for that bottle of vodka which was getting lonely), so I called room service to order two double vodkas, a can of mixer and a bucket of ice.  I was told that the ice machine was on the floor below and they couldn't bring ice.  After checking three floors, I finally found the ice machine.  Returning to my floor, I was greeted by a funky smell. I thought that it was a dead animal.   Walking down the hallway, it struck me that the dead animal smell was actually some of the most pungent marijuana that I've ever experienced (and I've experienced A LOT of marijuana!).  After catching the hallway buzz, I relaxed in the room and was quickly delivered my cocktails, though without the mixer- full glasses of straight Absolut.  The full effect of the complimentary weed had now permeated both the hallway and my room.  The entire floor reeked! In any event, the room was fine.  I would have liked a bar, restaurant, faster elevators and newer towels, but overall an OK place to stay.  If I get another free suite and another free contact high, I'll definitely do back.",3
1598,"we used this hotel as our suite to get ready in before wedding, our honeymoon suite, and family rooms. the website is misleading and the staff were unfriendly. the rooms that we thought our guests and ourselves were getting (depicted on website) was not the room they put us in. awful animal print and DIRTY. VERY DIRTY My hotel suite did not come with refrigerator and the toilet leaked. the staff was not helpful and not friendly. I would not recommend that anyone stay at this hotel.",1
1599,"We stayed here for a few days during a recent staycation. The room we had was fantastic. There was a river view with an actual ""river view"" ( Marina City and Trump Tower were my neighbors, sort of speak). There was a spacious bathroom, a very comfortable King size bed and a small couch. There was a huge executive style desk in there as well with wifi.Very well maintained, and the staff was efficient and courteous. The cleaning staff always asked if we needed anything before leaving for the day. Location is perfect  for checking out museums ( CTA # 10 and #146 right across the street) and the Mag Mile. A Corner Bakery is just steps from the hotel and a great option to go for breakfast al fresco during the summer. I will definitely return.",5
1600,"I want to go back. I want to go back. I want to go back.  I have had a ton of hotel stays recently...and I compare them all to this amazing hotel in chicago where I stayed for a week about a year and a half ago.  even though it was so long ago, I wanted to write a review for it.  that being said, staff changes and with time, hotels change.  so yelpers, read my review with that in mind!  While I was there, they were going through some construction on some of the floors so I got a great deal from expedia.  I didn't hear a thing.  the staff were super friendly and super helpful.  I could use their business center for the interviews that I was going to go to, and I was walking distance to jazz alley, fannie mae chocolates, great food, and downtown on top of my interview.  The location of this place is INSANE.   I was reading reviews written recently where they say the rooms are smaller than some of the other hotels etc.  I don't know WHERE they put me, and if the rooms are different, but I had a great room.  it had two beds in it, a chaise, tons of floor space, a exec desk, a flat screen, amazing shower, and an amazing view.  everything smelled new and looked great.  they had coupon books for visiting and when I went to the front desk they would draw me a map wherever I went.   on one of the nights where I came back really late (because I got lost) and my friends, knowing that I didn't know the area came back with me, the hotel staff even asked if they wanted to stay with me in my room and offered pillows and bath stuff.  I was shocked.  nobody EVER does that.  amazing staff, amazing stay, I want to go back.",5
1601,"So I stayed at this Hotel back in September 2010.  While the hotel itself is fantastic, the location is fantastic, the staff is friendly and accomodating...if you have an issue with anything specific to service and follow up keep your expectations LOW! I parked a rental car in their overnight valet throughout my stay.  My last night there, the car was damaged.  I didnt notice it until after I had left the hotel, and stopped at a gas station.  Despite multiple assurances that the issue would be handled accordingly, five months later I still receive phone calls and other correspondence from the rental car company, stating they still have an unpaid repair bill. The service at valet attached to this hotel is sickening.  I waited for 30 minutes to get the car one day, AFTER placing the requested phone call ahead of my departure.  When I left and checked out from the hotel, the car tenant had this evil grin on his face I and was awarded an open door to my rental car.  Gee, I wonder why. DO WHAT YOU HAVE PROMISED ME AND MAKE THIS ISSUE GO AWAY!",2
1602,"I came here for a pre-night event on the top floor (like in the Dark Knight). The view is FANTASTIC. The drinks and the appetizers were alright. But, oh man, the view was just out of this world. I was supposed to be networking and mingling but I kept grabbing another drink and just going to stand-by the windows with a few friends I had met that evening. Such a magnificent view always brings up great conversation and I had a fabulous night. If I could someday afford it I don't think this would be a bad place to host an event.",4
1603,Just stayed here Last weekend and had the best view I've ever had in a hotel! Good service: When we checked out they let us check our bags at the front desk so we could take a boat tour. Great location. The bathroom was great 2 sinks and the overhead shower rocks. The only strange thing (which is not a huge deal) was that ice was only available on one floor and it was not our floor. So it was a bit inconvenient. I would definitely stay again.,5
1604,"decent boutique hotel in chicago. staff was friendly & helpful in helping two inebriated souls acquire lost key cards at 2am. fantastic bleu cheese burger. i am not kidding. i was, however, hungover. perhaps that's a biased account. great shower in the room. great view. great location. i'd reccomend it to out-of-towners who want to stay mostly in the heart of the city, but not to folks who want to do some off the beaten path exploring.",3
1605,"Reasonably priced hotel with great location right by the Chicago River and a block to Michigan Avenue's shopping haven. The rooms are spacious, we fit 5 girls to a room without anyone beating anyone up for space. Hotel 71 tries to display a modern and sleek look by choosing trendy and funky furniture and it works. Parking can be expensive, around $40 overnight parking. I would recommend parking across the street at the Prudential Plaza or Millennium Park Garage for $16-$20 24 hrs. parking.",4
1606,"One of the nicest views I've had in Chicago. I remember taking lots of pictures of the view from my room, and that's all I really remember about my stay there. I guess the room and bathroom were ok, not great.",3
1607,"my friend got a great room for a great deal: the view of the chicago river, trump tower is great! the yummy smelling shampoo they give out, the fact that the one bed room is clean and large, the friendly concierge who kindly gave us a menu for late night food delivery and chatted it up with us, and the decor is great! what's not so great: the fact that the fridge appears to be missing, the lack of a flat screen tv, the door to the elevators are full length mirrors that both me and my friend got so confused about that we both ran into them as the elevator door opened for us. my friend got confused cos he thought the elevator was full of mirrors (he was sober). i walked into it cos i was well a bit tipsy shall we say. unnecessary safety hazard! we'll upload a photo later for this. it's great that they offer dry cleaning (obviously for those who pack mainly office attire) but not all of the clientele are travelling on business. put in a laundry machine for the rest of us thanks! they charge $2.50 per pair of socks. ridiculous.",3
1608,Nice joint - slow elevators,4
1609,"When I did alot of business in Chicago, I always wanted to stay at this place.  Finally I arranged things so that'd happen.  I ended up with a room  that had a nice view of the river, but I was about two feet from the elevators.  Service seemed dismal, at the time the bar didn't have an alcohol license yet (the hotel had been open at least a year).  There's so many other great hotels in Chicago, spend your money elsewhere.",1
1610,"I stayed here for a week and it was awesome... The good thing about the hotel is primarily the location. You are at the downtown (near michigan street) and all the day/nightlife awesomeness that is Chicago is around you. Public transportation, restaurants, tourist attractions, bars, clubs, weird people and you're on the chicago river. Also, the rooms are fairly spacious, but older. Oh and Batman Dark Knight was filmed at this location. The down side is it is pricey and there are only a couple elevators that service the hotel - so mornings are a pain in the ass to get up and down from say the 30th floor to the lobby. The service is ok, but come on - this place is ideal for a Chicago experience. Go Check it out...",4
1611,"One of the best hotels I've stayed at!  Great room, great service and great location!!  Just need a better tv, but hey it's Chicago so who needs tv ;)",5
1612,I think it's pretty great.,5
1613,"I want to start out by saying that my first visit to Hotel 71 was one of the most magical experiences that one can have in Chicago. It's located right on the river and the Premiere River King suites have breathtaking views, rainforest showers and modern Kuerig coffee makers, a welcome relief from those Hotel coffee makers that sound like someone is violently gargling as if choking to death only to produce a cup of coffee that tastes as if it were strained in a traveling salesmen's soiled sock. I have however deducted stars for two reasons. 1) they no longer serve adequate room service (my first trip they had this wonderful lox served on wafer-thin bagels that I am yet to locate in any health food store) and 2) my last trip they put me in the wrong room and then transferred me to a small Premiere room that was nothing near what I had come to expect for the same price. Repetition is required for excellence in my book. I want to state that I fully intend to try this hotel again and update my score if it improves since my first visit was so memorable for me. I still recommend this place over some if the others I've tried on the river. Please Hotel 71: bring back the lox on thin bagel crackers, upgrade the room service and keep your promises when people book a room. Thanks.",3
1614,"3.5 rating would be a better rating.  We were on the water side at 34 floors up.  Great view of the near north side.  We also had a larger than normal room that included a chaise, which was great for reading.  Our sink (along with the room next door) was backed up but the problem was soon fixed.  So a great hotel if you are lucky enough to get a view, but it a remodeled hotel in a older building so don't be surprised if there are some hiccups to your stay.",3
1615,"What a great view!  The room and bathroom were spacious... nice lobby... overall the hotel was chic but did not have that ""I'm-trying-too-hard"" feel to it like some other boutique hotels.   The staff was great and very patient with some day-of-arrival schedule changes caused by weather delays and cancellations at the airport.  Good customer service from the desk and door staff (I know it is their job, but they handled it well-- including hailing cabs and making sure we had umbrellas during downpours).   The only downside about the hotel is that the rooms do not have in-room safes.   I'll definitely consider staying again for business or pleasure, especially considering the rates.  It was convenient to the Hyatt and within walking distance of good restaurants, shopping, and the river walk.",4
1616,"This is a tough one to rate.  I say two stars for the room and six(!) for the view. I was here in mid-Oct for a conference and my company placed me here so I gave no idea of the price.  The room itself wasn't particularly memorable.  Better than a Motel 6 but less than a Hyatt.  Good bed and furniture but a bit noisy with a janky sink and an old, stained bathtub.  Ick. The location was good, not far from the train, subway, or Millennium Park.  The convention center was a $10 cab ride away.  Not sure if the hotels north of the river like near 'Miracle Mile' were better. The view was insane, though.  I had a view straight down the river from the 31st floor.  I've never had a view that spectacular.  All my associates had better hotel rooms a few blocks north but they were all amazed with the view.  It more than made up for the room quality.",3
1617,Very attentive and polite service. Room is a good size. Free business center (nice for printing out boarding passes). Overall a quite pleasant stay.,4
1618,"I was able to book this hotel via smartphone while at the airport just before midnight. I got downtown and checked in without a glitch. I got a 38th floor room with and AMAZING view! The one downside was that my room literally surrounded the elevator bank. The room was nice, clean and comfortable. Room service was adequate (but I think they added $3 extra to the ""service charge""). Great location. Great staff. Would stay here again.",4
1619,"Hotel 71 was a decent hotel.  Rooms were nice and large and we had a great river view.  The hotel was in a great central location as well.  Could have used a few more amenities in the room such as a fridge (since, come on, what are you supposed to do with your leftovers!!).  Also, room service would come in VERY late, which we thought was very odd...we had a DND on the door and had come back to the room at 5pm and left again at 6pm.  when we left, we did not put the DND back on the door since it was so late, well, when we returned late that night, room service had been in...odd they were there so late.  The doorman was very pleasant and so was the staff.  Oh and I do have to say, the beds were not very comfortable, very stiff and the pillows were too big and awkward. And the WiFi, while free, was S-L-O-W!   I probably will not stay here again unless we get an awesome deal or something.",3
1620,"For the most part, I enjoyed my stay at Hotel 71. You get two views in this place. There's the adjacent rooftop view with pigeons and industrial objects, or there's the magnificent view with the boats traveling under the bridges below. I had trouble with wireless in my room, so after a very nice technician visited my room, I was upgraded from the already nice room I had with the rooftop view to a much nicer room with a fabulous view of the loop below. As a Wilco fan (you'll only get this as a Wilco fan) I was thrilled to have the cover art for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot right outside my window (The Mariana Towers). The hotel staff were nice and helped create the boutique feel. Nice hotel bar. Nice furnishings. I was happy that in both my suites I had a giant bathtub and a nice rain shower in addition. Both bathrooms had flat screen TVs, so I could watch the news in the morning and relax in the evenings. Convenient to the theaters- we walked to Wicked and it was only a few blocks. My suites both had nice chaise lounges for a little post-work relaxation. I highly recommend this hotel for your next business or pleasure stay.",4
1621,"A dump.  Stayed here for way too much over the marathon weekend.  Paint peeling in the bathroom, unfinished elevators/lots of waiting time, dark and unimpressive lobby.  Really cheesy furnishings too in the rooms: leopard chaises??  If you can get a good deal and need a good location fine, but don't go for quality.",2
1622,"We got this hotel for a stay cation in the city, there were 4 of us girls. The lobby is really small but decorated in a boutique style, very cute. The guy behind the counter was super friendly and he even upgraded us to a river-view room even though we just got the city-view room (which was just basically view of buildings). When we got up to the room the view was amazing and the room was very spacious, great for a group of people, for a pre-game or something. We got 2 double queens. It was pretty entertaining to watch the view down to the river. You could tell that this hotel was revamped, meaning you could tell this was a hotel that was prob very crappy before and attempting to be something nicer than it is. Everything looks really nice but there are some things if you really want to be nitpicky, like the size of the shower, small, the water pressure did not change at all. The carpet looked dirty, there was even a stain, and they had haphazardly covered the chaise (leopard print) with a navy blue cover. But hey, it is a pretty nice hotel in a very good location, close to everything and at a decent price. I could find myself staying here again.",4
1623,"stayed here on my biz trip a few weeks back and was pleasantly surprised with the room. bigger than most standard hotel rooms with a nice loungy couch and big windows to view downtown chicago.  nice hip decor and free internet access in room. the bathroom had a nice mirrored closet. would come back again. but i dont think they have a hotel bar.  oh by the way, the penhouse was used as Bruce Wayne's penthouse from The Dark Knight",3
1624,"I stayed here last week when I was in town to see a couple of shows. The first thing I noticed upon my arrival was the professionalism of the staff.  I was very impressed with their helpful attitudes. Next, I ordered room service since I was crunched for time and found it to be enjoyable...no complaints.  I liked the room I stayed in and did not find it to be as small as I expected after reading other reviews.  It was certainly larger and, dare I say nicer, than the room I stayed in at the Hard Rock Hotel during my only other visit to Chicago.  The bathroom was huge and nicely decorated with a shower and tub and two vanities.  I did not have a problem with the elevators unlike other reviewers.  In fact, there was one waiting for me on several occasions.  The only things I saw as lacking was there was no refrigerator in the room and the bar in the lobby is lame compared to the one at Hard Rock.  Other than that, I'd much rather stay at Hotel 71 on my next visit to Chicago.  It doesn't have the ""cool"" factor that the Hard Rock has but in many aspects, I found it to be a better hotel.",4
1625,"After both getting some surprisingly great holiday bonuses, my husband and I decided that while we had to attend a wedding reception here, we would make it a staycation. We used http://Hotels.com for booking since they have the frequent traveler 10-night-get-one option and were working towards our free night. The rooms at Hotel 71 were modern and spacious. Usually stark modern hotels are not cozy but 71 rocked it. We had a small issue (they oversold our room type) which was immediately remedied and we got an unexpected upgrade which was a win in our book. We got the premier king river view room and when we walked in, I was pinching myself wondering if a room this nice could really exist at the price we paid. Its hard to find anything worth complaining about so I am giving them a solid five stars. For the wedding reception room there were about 100 people and it was not crammed and the views were great especially since our friend's family came in from out of town.",5
1626,"hm. room was ok, bathroom looked like someone's crummy apartment though.  not worth the money. but the real problem was the experience.  After calling to confirm our room with a river view for a special occasion the day prior, we somehow still did not get our room with a view as confirmed.  The desk manager managed only to repeat that he didn't know what to say, that we wouldn't be charged for the better room. we chose this hotel based on it's location and view.  i also noticed we weren't the only ones with problems unfortunately.  so the service, again, was not worth the money. won't be coming back or recommending it. overall, i feel that a city as great as chicago should expect more of a hotel in it's tourism center.",2
1627,"Make sure to ask for a newly renovated room!  My boyfriend and I checked in later in the evening and we received an older room.  No frills, no dresser, no view.  However, the next night we asked to be moved and were given a room with a killer view of the river, a fridge, microwave, safe, flat screen TV, plus it was much nicer and in the shower, the paint wasn't chipping.  We got an insane room rate through http://Kayak.com.  The best part is the hotel is right in the middle of Everything!  Great location to walk anywhere.  The staff was always helpful and friendly.",4
1628,The location and view were amazing but make sure your room is far from the elevators.  They were so incredibly loud that my husband got very little sleep.  Also the internet was painfully slow... used a groupon and they charged an extra fee for using it.  Seemed dishonest as I had asked if there were any other fees when I booked it originally and was told no.,3
1629,"So for our 2.5 year anniversary I left all the planning up to my boyfriend. I was pleasantly surprised at the hotel he picked for us to stay...admittingly I am sort of a ""hotel snob"", & from walking in the door to checking out had a very good experience. My boyfriend surprised me with having chocolates covered strawberries ready and waiting in our room as a romantic surprise. They also delivered a bottle of White wine on our first night (our official anniversary date). The decor of the hotel was pretty modern & our room was huge! We had an amazing view of the city from our room, I couldnt stop looking out the window & actually slept with the windows open. The only reason I couldnt rate this hotel a 5star hotel. We encountered 2 problems. One of the 2 elevators stopped working so guests had to use either the 1 working elevator or the service elevator, which made length deliveries & things much longer. Also I have really sensitive skin & dont use the soaps provided by the hotel management, so I usually travel with my own soap, not thinking anyone would throw it away i left it in the shower, for the next time i use it. When we got back to our room after being out all day, I noticed our room was cleaned & my soap was gone & replaced with a brand new HOTEL BAR OF SOAP. Luckily we were close enough to everything, from downtown, millenium park & shopping..I was able to replace what they had thrown away...needless to say I didnt leave my soap in the shower in the next morning.",3
1630,"This hotel is like Joan Rivers. It looks okay on the outside, but everything inside is falling apart. The wallpaper in the hotel room was peeling off, the hot water handle ""on"" the sink in the bathroom fell off, and the shower faucet sprayed water so strong and aggressively it almost knocked me out of the shower a few times. The towels in the bathroom were cheap and overly linty. There was also no mini-fridge (which is always greatly needed) and the TV was a piece of junk (not a newer flat-screen as their web site indicated)--the reception was also horrific. Great location (despite filming at the time) and the staff were pleasant enough. I later noticed in the lobby cobwebs hanging from the crookedly positioned valances and lights. That should've been our first clue. Anyway, we also ate at the restaurant in the hotel. Very mediocre. There was even a piece of hair or thread on my hamburger bun. Gross.",2
1631,"Besides the location and the view, this is by far the most overrated hotel in Chicago,  Our room was severely outdated and literally dirty.  The window had duct tape around the edges (presumably for ""insulation"").  The sink & shower faucets leaked water everywhere (mold is definitely growing behind the scenes).  The linens felt like sandpaper and there were no extra blankets or pillows.  The closets didn't even have hangers in them.  The television (they advertised flat screens) was a Zenith from the early 90's.  Room service was fast, but the food was mediocre and outrageously expensive.  The only thing slower than the elevators is the valet.  You can expect your car 20 to 30 minutes after calling for it, despite the fact that the garage is attached to the hotel.  If you're on a budget, don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a lot for very little with this hotel.  There are plenty of budget hotels in the city that are much, much nicer than Hotel 71.",1
1632,"i'm breaking up with this hotel.  we had a really good thing going for a while.  it was my back up when the westin on michigan ave was full.  when you travel as much as i do, you've gotta have a plan B. so we had a few really good nights together.  i asked for exactly what i wanted and the staff would always accomodate me.  i paid they provided service...nothing outrageous. well, the last time i stayed at this multiple personality pensione, they may have been trying to break up with me actually.  i think they were caught off guard cuz i showed up with my 3 offspring and all this homemade italian food in shopping bags which i needed to quickly deliver to my sister.  maybe they thought we were a family on the run and they wanted no part of it.  instead of checking us in they told me they had no record of my reservation.  excuse me, come again, i beg your friggin pardon.  that's fine if you are stupid, i understand not everyone is born with the most useful set of DNA, but come on, i have a confirmation number. so rather than stare at me like you have no idea what to do, just give me a room now so i can unload my crap and get a cab to deliver the now overdue food.  have you ever tried discussing your rights with an idiot?  it just doesn't work.  they don't know the standard rhythm for this sort of thing.  since i was already dealing with the manager, there was really nowhere to go but out on the street.  i finally convinced her disclose their clearly defunct system for online reservations and found the obvious error.  your online reservation is not actually a done deal when you reserve online.  what?!  you mean to tell me if i make a reservation using the website i can't be gauranteed the room i was just confirmed to have been charged for.  yes, that's right folks, you read it correctly.  allegedly, they look at all the online reservations a few times per day so if you happen to have made your reservation after the last time they checked and show up before the next time they check, they actually have no idea why you would be standing at their front desk expecting lodging.  hmm, i wonder if they've ever heard of this new fangled thing called real-time scheduling.  the manager could not have been any more rude, obnoxious, or just plain dumb if she tried.   but finally i did convince her to maybe just to humor me, check the online reservation log and update the reservation file in front of her and lo and behold she found our name.  but the fun didn't end there.  my car which i left out front in a line to be taken away was still there when we went down to get a cab.  their garage was in fact full and they were really sorry but not sorry enough to have a list or directions to any garages that they might have possibly called in advance to make sure there was room and would keep a car overnight.  i guess that was my job.  so now that i made it through hoop number one and actually won a debate with an idiot to get the keys to my room i had another hoop to maneuver.  this could not have sucked more.  i ended up having to drive around for 40 minutes before i found a garage that would take my car overnight that wasn't already full.  this ended up being a giant pain in the neck.  if you ever are forced to stay here and decide to use the internet to make your reservation...you might want to call first to see what time they plan on merging their reservation files and figure out what to do with your car in advance.",1
1633,"well, its hard to beat the price.  location is great too.  For the money, i found the hotel very typical.  Not nice, but for close to $100/night, what do you expect?  As a frequent business traveler, I've paid more for a dive in Fresno...  My room was comfortable.  Front desk, check in was nearly over-formal for the style of the hotel.  The lobby was clean, nicely decorated.  I wouldn't be embarrassed having a business meeting there.  Pleasant doormen.  I had a corner room which was decent sized and had a great view.   There is a free business center which i used to print copies for a meeting.  Free wireless internet throughout the hotel.  I complained about a slow drain in the shower and it was fixed in a jiffy.  Its surprising how many ppl complain about the decor - the leopard chaise was fine - I actually stayed in a VERY high end hotel in Paris with similar color scheme, including a leopard print chair.  I'd have no problem staying here again.  The biggest problem is that it lacks any identity.  If you want identity, wander down to the Peninsula and fork up $600/night.",3
1634,"Having spent plenty of time at downtown Chicago hotels, I cannot recommend Hotel 71. I stayed in the Executive Suite and was very disappointed by downtown Chicago standards. The hotel itself seemed as if it were under construction in some of the hallways; ceiling tiles pushed in with wires exposed, the door to the meter room on our floor was open and not secured. Walking the hallways you could hear conversations in every room that you walked by. The suite itself was way below standard, it contained four closets, no of them were in the bedroom, seating for guests around the table in the sitting room was limited because there were only two chairs for the table, there were two televisions, but of the were both tube televisions. The bathroom was sub par and must have been inspired by a motel. There was nothing high class about this suite. I suggest if you want to experience a true hotel suite experience you go somewhere else. Hotel 71 is overpricing what they offer in their suites, you can find better for their price.",2
1635,"Terrific business hotel if you are working downtown. The gym is small but serviceable,  the rooms small but very clean and the restaurant that is attached serves wonderful meals. The best part of this hotel for some meeting clients is the European style lobby. It serves as a first rate office away from home with high speed internet, meeting areas and coffee in the morning . Staff are super polite and  helpful. The area has loads of good place to eat. If you have the time the lake front is an easy stroll from the hotel.",4
1636,"I'm not quite sure why this place gets 4 stars. I just spent 3 nights at the Allegro and will not be returning The Hotel: It's old. And dirty.  Like something the cops would raid in Training Day 2 The room: It was the size of a large closet.  The closet was the size of a large cardboard box.  The blinds are old and fold down with a drawstring that takes about 2 minutes to fully open or close.  Not ideal.  The bathroom is great if you enjoy being able to brush your teeth while evacuating your bowels and washing your hair, because all are within an arm's length. The elevators: There are 3 elevators for a 19-story building.  Be prepared for a long wait during peak times.  I actually took the elevator down to go up at around 6pm since they were all full on the way up. The staff: The only reason I give this hotel 2 and not 1 star is the staff.  Very polite, professional and reliable.",2
1637,"Hmm...not so sweet the second time around. I was in town for a wedding and chose to splurge and get a hotel room for two nights.  I had multiple offers from friends to stay with them to save $$  but I wanted to do this.  Should have stayed w/ friends. Don't get me wrong, I still like this hotel, it just lost its luster from my original experience.  I booked my room about a month beforehand on Orbitz and it was still a shit ton of cash-ola.  Two nights was $367.  Yikes!   Check-in and check-out are a breeze, if you pre-pay.   The room was very clean and the a/c worked lovely.   But the bed was definitely not what I remembered it to be.  It was like, lumpy or something.   Maybe it had been used a lot....?  (gross.)   I do love the mirrors in the room.  You kinda have to see it for yourself.  So all in all, it's a nice hotel with the fun perk of wine happy hour.  Who doesn't love that??!",4
1638,"A-OK.  The reservation desk is on the second floor.  Confused the hell out of me, especially when I arrived during the manager's reception, which was crowded as hell.  The room was cute but the walls paper thin.  Also, the bathroom was claustrophobically tiny.  There was unused space in the room so I think they could have redesigned to make the restroom slightly larger. Free wi-fi if you sign up for their loyalty program.  All they want is an email address.",3
1639,"This was a great hotel for the money. The location was perfect and very close to many Chicago attractions. It's right next to the L and pretty close to a couple Subway stations. They have a free wine reception every night from 5-6pm, which was a nice touch. The wine they served was Flip Flop wine which was pretty terrible, but it was free so what can you expect?! We stuck to the beer. They always have beverages out and switch them up during the day. If you forget anything from home, they have lots of stuff they'll bring to your room upon request - needed a makeup mirror and a couple toiletries which they brought right up. The service was great, the room was clean and nicely decorated, the ambiance was relaxing yet trendy, and the price was right. I would definitely stay here again!!",5
1640,"I needed a hotel that was a little less spendy than the $200+ rack rate of the conference hotel (and yes, that was with the conference ""deal.""). Luckily for me, my travel agent (aka the bf) found Hotel Allegro, which was a mile away, for less than 50% of what I would have spent if I had stayed at the conference hotel. Yes, this is less than their advertised rack rate. I have a great travel agent. Hotel Allegro is a Kimpton hotel and after my experience, I must say I'm a fan. A complimentary wine hour (5-6 pm) every day? Don't mind if I do. In the afternoon, chilled water with slices of lemon and lime and either lemonade or a tea spritzer are available for you to quaff after walking around under the blistering sun. In the morning, coffee (hot and iced) and tea, along with a myriad of newspapers (by the way, you can get a paper delivered to your door gratuit), are awaiting you. Hotel lobbies are usually such dead spaces, but here, they're a lively and yet tranquil place for hotel guests to sit and relax. The only drawback is that the morning coffee is of Yale Club quality* (http://www.yelp.com/user…). The room was sumptuous and comfortable. After joining some hotel program, I had all the free wifi I wanted. The maid was scrupulously honest. I left some money as a tip for her (labeled in an envelope ""for the maid""), and when I came back, the money was left untouched because I guess she couldn't read English (I read somewhere that this was not uncommon). So the next day, I left the envelope on the bed where it was clear that the money was intended for her. The rest of the staff was also very courteous and accommodating. I had a lovely stay at Hotel Allegro and I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Chicago. *If you can't be bothered to read my review, it means that the coffee is extremely weak and watered down.",4
1641,"I stayed here from June 7th - 11th fora a birthday weekend getaway, and I found myself pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Comfy beds, trendy decor, two on-site restaurants and a world class staff. I made a big mistake though, forgetting to tip my wonderful house keeper, so to whoever you are - I was in room 602 and I hope that this review makes up for my lack of appreciation. It's completely out-of-character of me and I sincerely apologize. Thank you so much to the Kimpton staff for being some of the most hospitable team members I've come across. You've definitely earned my loyalty in the Kimpton Hotel family and I'm looking forward to a repeat visit. I hope this review finds you and your future guests well. Great hotel, Great location, and one memorable experience to keep forever. Thanks for being rockstars.",4
1642,"My husband and I were in town from London, UK for a wedding and stayed at the hotel through part of a very reasonably priced wedding rate.  When I made the reservation online a few months prior, I noted that it was also our anniversary weekend and I would happily pay for champagne and strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arrival.  At check in, the woman at the front desk wished me and my hubby a happy anniversary.  It had been a few months since I had made the reservation and during that time I had gotten some rather unexpected news that I was pregnant (Btw Yelp friends, this is why I haven't Yelp'ed any restaurants lately--morning/all day sickness doesn't allow me to be very adventurous!)  I thanked the woman, confided our baby news and told her that we no longer needed champagne (no point in me getting bitter with the hubs as he chugged down ""our"" bottle).  An hour after we got to the room, there was a knock at the door and a staff member dropped off sparkling water and a bucket of (what I thought was) champagne.  I sighed and briefly considered just giving the bottle back...until I looked a bit more closely.  Hotel Allegro has popped a bottle of sparkling apple cider into a champagne bucket and included a hand written note congratulating me and the hubby on our anniversary and our new bambino.  BEST HOTEL CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.   Although I didn't get to indulge in anything but water during the 5-6 PM wine hour, my hubby loved it.  Close to all the downtown hot spots, the location of this hotel is spectacular. The only cons...small rooms and not the thickest walls in between rooms.  Without a doubt, I would happily stay there again though!  Absolutely amazing hotel experience with great customer service.",5
1643,"My best friend and I were going to a concert downtown (July 28, 2012).  I live in Chicago and she lives in the suburbs but we wanted to book a hotel room and make a night of it.  We tried for a week to get a room but literally all the hotels were booked, as there must have been a convention in town or something.  So, we waited until the day before and tried again.  The cancellation policy for most hotels is 24 hours.  We got lucky enough to get a room at the Hotel Allegro.   It was a really great place to stay.  I've read all of the other reviews and people have complained about silly things like the fact that the lobby is on the second floor.. no big deal, there is an elevator.  They also complained about the rooms not being very big.  That didn't bother me because they were SPOTLESSLY clean.  The bathroom and closet were tiny but for us, it didn't matter.  We were only staying overnight.  The only challenge we had was that we both couldn't be in the bathroom doing hair/makeup at the same time.  That's a small sacrifice for a great hotel and super friendly staff!  We got vouchers for complimentary drinks to use at any time since we checked in after their free wine party.  That was really cool!   I also ""LIKED"" their page on Facebook and there was a secret word that we were to give upon registration for a free gift.  We got a $50 food voucher which we used for breakfast the next morning.   Overall, I was VERY satisfied with our stay there and I would stay again FOR SURE!",5
1644,"Weird hotel layout. Hotel bar closed at 12 on a Saturday night during lollapalooza. Staff at front desk always seemed harried and overwhelmed. Rooms were tiiiiiinnnnyyyyy. For the price expected better but the room just felt like a mini attempt to be ""hip""...it was as if my mom's ""decorator"" friend designed it. Word to the wise for hotels...if you want to make an older building look updated don't update it with older looking pieces and shabby bathroom fixtures. Also the mirrors all looked as if they had been through the great fire. It was a bit unnerving. I just wanted to look good, but I couldn't tell a thing in them. No wonder I had no free drinks that night! Overall a disappointment for the Kimpton brand.",3
1645,"When friends come to visit I recommend Kimpton, so for our anniversary we planned a little ""staycation"" I am sad to say I was disappointed.  I love the vibe of Kimpton, and the lobby had it, but we must remember this is a HOTEL and the rooms are sad!  The rooms had a few problems:  1.  small room  2.  tiny bathroom 3.  thin walls  4.  housekeeping was knocking on our door early in the am.  All night I heard people getting off the elevator, I wanted more than Allegro could give.",2
1646,"Honestly, I usually like Kimpton's. This one has the worst Feng Shui (why are there mirrors across from the bed? Just creepy!). The walls might as well be made of cardboard because you can hear EVERYTHING happening next door. Pros: Hotel staff is nice, except the lady at the free wine hour who carded me. Seriously? And of course I didn't have my ID because I'm staying at the hotel. Not going all the way back up then down just for your tiny glass of wine. Other pros... clean, bed is relatively comfortable, AC, convenient location... iPod dock. Free WiFi if you register with Kimpton online. Cons: See above plus tiny rooms, even tinier closet, noisy, noisy, noisy!!!!!!!! Decor = not my style. And oh, THEY CARDED ME at the free wine hour which was full of business professionals. I was dressed like a business professional, am pushing 30, and that's just kind of embarrassing to be honest. But again, the worst part is that the walls are made of cardboard and you can hear everything happening everywhere. Bring ear plugs.",2
1647,"Our room was very nice, we had a King bed, reg. room.  It was small, but very cute ! We had one small suitcase and no where to put it.  It would be nice if the hotel had a folding stand for a suitcase.  Yes,  the bathroom is small also, but very clean and nice.   The staff was great !  We every much enjoyed our stay !!!!!  Great location too !",3
1648,"Im a big fan of Kimpton Hotels -- they're always a little funky, quirky, and not to mention comfortable. The Hotel Allegro is really no different. Location is great -- sort of business district I guess, but everything in the city is walkable (granted this is Illinois, and therefore flat. I walked 15 miles in one day w/out really realizing it). Check in was a breeze, staff were friendly and helpful, and made sure I knew about the wine tastings they had available for FREE. That was an awesome extra touch as well. Lobby has trendy oontzy music playing, elevators are quick. Rooms are mod and posh -- though not on the huge side. For one to two people though they are more than fine. There are plenty of extra pillows on a comfy bed (always a bonus for me). Internet access is available for an exorbitant price. Room service, Big tv -- but I didn't use them, and thin as paper walls. I heard my neighbors having a good old time every morning about 6 am and Im sure they heard my late night good times as well. At least we all were enjoying ourselves. Checkout was easy - via the phone. I did however pay extra for a late checkout and the damned cleaning staff kept forgetting and walking in on me while I was packing/getting ready to go. All in all a great centrally located hotel, will def come back when im in the windy city again.",4
1649,"Wonderful property from a meeting planner's point of view! I hosted a 2 day meeting here this week and everything went great! the service was top notch! Jesse and his banquet team were pleasant, friendly and helpful the entire time. the food was affordable and tasty! I would love to come back soon!",5
1650,"We stayed at the Hotel Allegro the weekend of our wedding. We talked to ""small groups"" who told us to book reservations on our credit card and transfer them to our guests. This system did not work! Small groups and the reservations department don't coordinate! Anytime someone would call to transfer one room all the rooms got transferred into their name! For instance, at one point my aunt was going to be billed for all 9 rooms we had booked! Luckily we figured it out, but it took us 4 hours on the phone with them 2 days before the wedding to straighten it out. And they did not offer us a discount!!! So we went in pretty upset. Despite this the people on the phones were always very pleasant. It was just the system seemed to be inadequate. The hotel is actually a pretty cool place. The lounge areas are sort of hip and the rooms and our King Suite were very nice. I'd recommend staying here if you just book your own room. Don't use small groups!!! This may be a Kimpton problem more than just an Allegro problem.",2
1651,"This was our home base while in Chicago and the entire hotel was up to excellent Kimpton standards.  Yes, it's an older building but our room was spacious enough for two and we never heard a peep from other guests.  We were right next to the elevator and the housekeeping closet which resulted in some morning noise during peak cleaning times but obviously it didn't bother us too much as we managed to loiter in bed one morning until 10 am.  Speaking of which, nice beds!  I'm picky about those and slept wonderfully without any back or neck aches. The hotel staff was exceptional with great recommendations and advice and we enjoyed the adjoining Liquid Lounge.  After walking up Michigan Ave one afternoon I'm so glad we opted to stay here instead of on the Magnificent Mile - navigating the crowds there would have driven me batty!  The neighborhood is relatively quiet, clean, safe and had all the amenities (drugstores, local eateries) we needed.  Clark/Lake blue line is a short walk for airport transport, and we walked to Millennium Park, Magnificent Mile, and Willis Tower from the hotel. Small downside:  no in-room coffee makers but we didn't mind hopping down to the lobby in the mornings to get our fix. I particularly love the pet friendliness of Kimpton hotels - I rarely travel with my dog but being able to greet the traveling pooches while I'm away from home makes me happy.",3
1652,Very nice ambiance. The restaurants and bars in this hotel taste and fit well. Rooms kinda small. Close to everything downtown and Valet was very helpful with ideas for shopping. I would revisit.,4
1653,"I was procrastinating on V-day plans and ended up booking this hotel for a last-minute staycation. The hotel itself was very beautiful. I liked the sweeping staircase--kind of reminded me of the one from Titanic. The lobby is pretty standard, I don't understand why people rave about it. The service didn't really stand out. The concierge was not very good. She didn't really give me any helpful tips/information like they usually do. Her only suggestion was informing me of the 4-course Valentine's Day dinner at the hotel restaurant. Our room was small-- but since we didn't have any luggage-- the size didn't bother us. We also didn't hear any noise from the other rooms and the hotel was quiet overall. We got free wifi by signing up with their rewards program  so that was nice. The bed is hands downs my favorite part of our stay. It was hard to leave it :/ The location is probably its biggest selling point. It was too cold and windy to walk but I can imagine that it would be super nice in the summer. Cab fare is about $7 plus tip to the restaurants off of Michigan. I would rate my overall experience as 3 stars but I'm taking off one star for the non existent service. I will probably pay the extra money to stay at Hotel Palomar next time.",2
1654,"This is a really cute hotel! I haven't actually stayed at the Allegro, but my work held its Christmas party here. It was on a Friday in December, and our group of about 40 people were in part of the ""Living Room"" and ""Cameo"" room on the second floor. It was a really nice, cozy, lounge-like atmosphere. There was a large fireplace and uniquely shaped leather couches. I would describe the decor as ""retro chic."" There were a lot of bold prints mixed with dark woods and interesting art. Very hip and cool! There was also an area for the open bar, and hotel staff circulated with hors d'ourves. The food was tasty. We had chicken teriyaki, beef wellington and different types of pizza. It was good! Our bosses actually decided to extend the open bar another half hour because everyone was having such a good time. Another positive about the Allegro is its location. It is just around the corner from our office building, and it is right in the heart of the Loop. The Cadillac Palace Theater is right next door, and you're within walking distance from the river, the lake and all the Loop has to offer. I would recommend the Hotel Allegro for work parties or other gatherings. It's a very cool place and interesting venue!",4
1655,"This hotel was the perfect start to our mini-vacation: a long weekend in Chicago.  The location is awesome, right in the loop so super close to any line of the El train.  Also was within walking distance of all the restaurants I had chosen.   Everything from walking in and having someone jump up to hold the doors for us, to the grand staircase as we entered, to the super funky décor of the lobby told us that this was going to be an experience in itself.  Little did we know... I had done my research ahead of time to know that not only does the hotel offer a free wine reception every evening (sweet!), but they also have a ""code word"" that you can use to get a special surprise when you check in.  I was expecting a $10 voucher for the restaurant, or something of that scale.  What we actually received was a king suite on the top floor of the hotel.  I think that's the biggest hotel room I've ever been in.  Our jaws dropped as we entered and began to look around.  I crossed the room to the bathroom where I saw that we had a Jacuzzi tub!  I called out to my boyfriend to tell him, only to find out that he was also checking out a bathroom.  For those not keeping up, we had two bathrooms.  Man did I ever feel pampered!   The décor in the room was awesome too.  Definitely nothing like what I would do in my own home, but I loved the funky design of the wallpaper and the blue picture of a cello.  It was so nice that we didn't even mind when I got heat exhaustion and spent the second half of Sunday in the room!  We ordered delivery from Lou Malnati's and relaxed. My only complaint is that the walls were pretty thin, so we could hear the tv in the bordering rooms sometimes, but it didn't really bother us at all.  Also, for at least one day two of the three elevators were out of commission, but they worked on that fairly quickly, and allowed us to use the service elevators in the meantime.  Honestly, everything else was so amazing that I'm going to give it a 5 star rating anyways! All in all, I loved this hotel, and would definitely stay there again.  Thanks for an awesome weekend Kimpton!",5
1656,"A little older, but still charming. I got a suite once with two bathrooms and one had a jacuzzi tub, which I took advantage of. Big comfy bed! Their evening wine hour is cozy, and casual offering beer wine. Sometimes, servers circulate with little bites. I tried the Zumba class once, which was a fun work out with 8 or so other women (including a couple Kimpton staff). They had pitchers of water in the back of the room. As other Yelp reviewers have noted, it can be cramped, but seems like a decent room rate for its location and excellent Kimpton service.",4
1657,"The Allegro is always a nice stay. Love that they are pet friendly, love the Tootsie Rolls at check in and the wine reception is a nice bonus if you are game for a complimentary drink. We've stayed here for many years and have never had any problem. We usually get one of the smaller rooms, but since we are out and about so much it's perfect. This last time we had cocktails and then appetizers and drinks later on in the lounge, and the bar service was professional and spot on. The room prices are reasonable and it's only a few blocks to great shopping or Daley Plaza. If you are in the Kimpton rewards program, wi-fi is free.",4
1658,"From first glance you can see that this is an old building, but the insides are very modern. The decor is very nice, especially the oversized Christmas ornaments. The lobby is equipped with modern leather couches that are comforting and stylish. The service is exceptional, everyone was extremely friendly. Was here for a corporate Christmas party and had a blast. The cocktail hour included a never ending open bar. The area that the cocktail hour was held felt a bit crammed, but it was cozy. Since people were not sitting on the couches, they were just getting in the way. If possible I would suggest for them to move the couches around a little for the cocktail hour so there is more standing room and less of moving through a maze.... The dinner served was mouth watering. The steaks were tender and the tilapia was soft and flavorful. *** the steak is cooked medium rear, so if you like it more cooked, get the tilapia. The dessert was not good, at all, maybe only the chocolate covered strawberries but it's hard to mess that up. The cakes and pasties were just not appetizing, the texture, the contents and flavor were all off. The rooms are ""small"" but I've seen smaller rooms in Europe. In my opinion how much room does a person actually need in a hotel room. A bed, a desk, and maybe a tv..check, check and check. The pillows and the actually bed were soft and comfy. I am always in the lookout for a better pillow, I might actually email the hotel and ask what brand pillows they have so I can purchase some for my home! They provided validated self-parking for $25, ooooor you can do what we did and park less than a block away in the outside self-parking area that has a $14 weekend speacial :) The rooms run about $160 a night on average, and I think that for the location in downtown Chicago and quality if hotel that is a great price. Also, if you are an out of towner, this hotel's location is superb :)",4
1659,Very cool and clean!,4
1660,My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Allegro for my birthday weeked. It was wonderful. Check-in was smooth and the clerk was very nice and accomodating. We had the standard king room but the bed felt more like a queen. There wasn't much of a view but the did have plently of sunlight. The rooms are so cute. They are small but there is a lot of detail put into them to make you feel like you are in a much bigger space. The bathroom is super small but the french style doors added a nice touch. While my boyfriend and I were getting settled in there was knock and the door. It was room service. The hotel sent us a bottle of champagne and a small box of chocolates as a birthday gift. That was a very nice touch. I joined the Kimpton InTouch program (which is free) before we arrived and for an added bonus we were given free wifi and $10 credit for the mini bar. The valet service was super fast. Everytime we called for the car they had it waiting for us when we arrived down stairs. Our stay was prefect and for an added touch we were given bottle of water for the trip home. All in all this is was a great stay and we can't to go back.,5
1661,"Stayed here over a 3-day weekend.  Interior is very modern, trendy, and has an upscale feel for Gen X & Y-types.  This place reminds me a bit of the W-Hotel chain, but not as trendy. The Bad:   The room was fairly small. Disappointing.  The desk and bathroom tops were not very clean - they were full of stains.  The biggest annoyance during my stay was how thin the walls were.  I could literally hear the girls next door complaining about how some guy wasn't giving them any attention at the club - word for word.  I dont wanna hear any conversations from next door when I want to fall asleep (after 1am?) especially when the going rate is  $160+ a night.  Oh, and I could clearly hear a couple having sex on another side of the room.  Nice. (not really)   Advice to management: install more sound insulation between rooms. The Good: Service is friendly and attentive.  The hotel provides free wine (to guests) in the lobby at 5pm.  Nice.   There is a lounge called Encore on the first floor (didnt go, but it looks like a nice place to hangout for a drink).  Hotel provides a nice breakfast every morning, including plenty ice water (with lemon) in the lobby and freshly-popped popcorn in the afternoons. Location is next to the Chicago theater district and is fairly close to all the tourist spots. For $160+ a night, I expected a little more.  Not sure I will come back here, unless I get a great deal.  For the most part, the hotel is fine, but dont expect a quiet space in your room.  If you are looking for peace and tranquility, you may want to look elsewhere.",3
1662,"Hello Chicago! On my 1st ever visit to Chicago I stayed 3 days/ 2 nights with the girlfriend at Hotel Allegro. She was there for work so I tagged along since I'd never been to Chicago. Hotel Allegro has a prime location in the Loop & was only a short walk after getting off the CTA Blue Line. The lobby & common areas of Hotel Allegro are grandly & sharply dressed. The girlfriend & I arrived early morning so our room wasn't ready yet. Front desk service was thoughtful as they offered to stow our luggage & call us as soon as our room was ready. Free coffee, tea, etc is available in the lobby in the morning. We grabbed coffees & set out for some breakfast & exploration while our room was prepped. The call came while we were still eating breakfast. That was fast. Back at the hotel, service continued to be thoughtful as staff confirmed that the girlfriend was on an extended business stay & made sure she had a quiet room high enough from the street, on the corner & away from the elevator. The room itself was clean, smartly decorated & felt like it had been recently renovated, but smelled faintly of paint. Being a Queen Deluxe room, it was on the small side. While it had all the basic amenities, there was no coffee maker or microwave in the room. Free Wi-Fi is available in the room if you're signed up with Kimpton's Loyalty Program. No problem. I see this as a better option than paying $10 - $20 for 24 hours of internet access. So I signed up, got free Wi-Fi & Kimpton has since been nice enough to not assault my email inbox with loads of junk. For my 1st time in Chicago, Hotel Allegro was a great place to stay. It's a hotel that's been deftly redone, is centrally located, pays particular attention to service & has nice but smallish rooms. Any future trip to Chicago may also include a stay at Hotel Allegro.",4
1663,"Stayed here for a girls weekend because we got a great rate.  Location was very good.  We could walk to most of the Chicago tourist attractions.  The decor is modern and cool.  The rooms are tiny - I'd guess because it's a historic building - and there's no ventilation in the bathroom so everything stays wet all day.  There's also no coffee maker in the room, because they have coffee service in the lobby every morning.  They could use to update the elevator systems.  They're extremely slow and everyone lines up to cram into a car because they'd rather be up against someone else than wait another 10 minutes for the next one to come along.  A plus is the complimentary wine in the lobby every afternoon.  Overall we had a good stay, but I do think the quality doesn't quite live up to the price. Oh, and sign up for Kimpton preferred guest program (free) to access free wifi.",3
1664,Sometimes ya just need a staycation. That's what brought us here and we loved it. Loved: *the modern fun decor *the price *the layout of the lobby creates lots of cool seating areas *aveda bath goodies *a nice selection of complimentary items(incase you forget your fashion tape) *comfy bed *helpful staff *only about a half mile walk from the train station But seriously what is up with the crazy slow elevators?,5
1665,"My second Kimpton - the first being the Hotel Monaco a few blocks away earlier this year.  Both times, we've loved the room, the wine reception, and many other nice touches that keep us comfy and happy in Chicago. We haven't had such luck with the services promised for people with pets. At the Hotel Monaco (April 2011)  we checked in late, but not before grilling the phone operator about having pet sitting available for the next day (and booking it). We mentioned it again at check-in and were reassured that all we needed to do was check in with the concierge in the morning. Lo and behold, the concierge gave us one of those looks that the Maitre D' gives Ferris Bueller - raised eyebrow, corners of mouth turned down....Snooty? Snotty! He had no idea. Nothing was booked, and nothing could be on short notice. I love the pet friendly vibe of the Allegro - but we ended up boarding our dog at a nearby place for the night. The pet-sitting service the concierge put us in touch with (Puppy Love) were helpful and accomodating in booking the times we required, but at a price of $360! 2 x 4 hour blocks for $360. So, Rover's down the road at the Mutt Hutt for $35. They were cool too. No in room coffee which makes for a monstrous morning, but all in all I like these hotels. I just hope they can raise their own bar when it comes to people travelling with dogs.",3
1666,"Very nicely updated hotel in Chicago's Loop area (near the theater district). Close to the Clark/Lake stop on the ""L"", especially convenient if youre coming from O'Hare. Rooms are spacious, considering that the place was built probably close to 100 years ago. Beds were comfy, and the front desk staff was helpful to a point. One particular staff member, Katie, was AWESOME. She was totally helpful to our group who was in town for a bachelor party, hooking us up with late checkouts and just being helpful with area knowledge, etc. Also really helpful was concierce extrodinare Anthony, hooking us up with free admission to a couple clubs, etc. (The other concierge never offered this, even though there were stacks of passes in the top drawer of the concierge desk...weird). My only real complaint was that when checking in, the front desk person (not Katie) steered us towards breakfast at the attached restaurant (312), and sort of mixed it in with all the complimentary services offered by the hotel (coffee in the morning, wine hour in the late afternoon, etc), so it sort of made it seem like breakfast was complimentary too. It definitely wasnt, in fact, it was really overpriced and awful. I'd definitely stay at Allegro again, I'd just be sure to steer clear of the restaurant.",4
1667,"Stayed here for the 4th of July weekend. PROS - - PET FRIENDLY (at no extra charge) - walking distance to a 7/11 (that sells hard alcohol!) - 10 minute walk away from The Bean and Willis Tower - cabs are always available - free wine everyday at the lobby from 5pm to 6pm - friendly staff - easy to find - 2 blocks from the O'Hare train line (Clark/Lake station) - decent room prices (we paid $110/night) via http://Hotels.com - free internet access - they have a ""recyclables"" trash can in the bedrooms! go green! :) CONS -   - the non-suite bedrooms are notably small. - bathroom mirror area is very small as well. only one person at a time.   - Room walls are very thin.  We were able to hear our neighbors' conversations and their tvs! we were also awakened by people having conversations in the hallway. good thing we weren't in the room that often! - no mini fridge - ice machines NOT available on every floor - on demand movies are $18.99! I'd stay here again, but I'd definitely book a larger room (i.e. a suite)",3
1668,"We stayed here: 1. Because they are pet friendly 2. Because they had the best rates downtown 3. Parking was only (ha) $36 for the night I was researching places to stay in Chicago for a good week before deciding on Hotel Allegro. It was nice they weren't charging the $50-100 pet fee other hotels in the area seem to think is normal. Also, they didn't have a size restriction. Our dog isn't huge, but she's about 50lbs and a lot of other hotels have a max of 25-30lbs. Dog racists if you ask me! There isn't any grass near the hotel that we could find (within 5 blocks at least) so if your dog needs grass to go, I would look elsewhere. Parking was a bitch. The parking garage isn't connected to the hotel, so you're stuck lugging your suitcases, purse, dog etc. down the busy sidewalks of Chicago. It's only half a block away but when you have a ton of crap, it seems like miles. The room was nice and CLEAN. And it was really quiet the whole time we were there. My only complaint about the room itself was the fact our thermostat was broken and we were freezing the whole night. It was stuck in the ""on"" position at 67 degrees, there was no way to turn off the fan or anything. We were able to walk to Michigan Ave quite easily from this location, and the Sears tower is close by.",4
1669,"I came for a training and stayed 2 nights. The food that they catered was semi decent but nothing mind blowing, but that could have been because of the menu the facilitators chose. The decor in the lobby is funky/retro/neat but the rooms were tiny!. There was barely any space to pass between the dresser and the bed. Also the bathroom doors weren't real doors, they were more like shutters. And as others have complained, you can hear everything that's happening in the hallways and the rooms next to you.",3
1670,"I've stayed at the Allegro several times in the past 5 years. Yes, the rooms tend to be small - but it's an historic building in downtown Chicago, and that's to be expected! From what I've experienced staying in other hotels in that area the Allegro's rooms are a fine size, and much nicer than most as far as decor and amenities. On our last visit (a weekend trip) we were offered a last-minute upgrade and got a huge 2-room suite for a fantastic price. We loved it, jacuzzi tub and all. Also, they've updated the wallpaper, furniture, and bedding since our last stay -- gorgeous. Staff were nice and helpful as always, the evening wine/cheese party was a plus, and the location is perfect for a weekend touring around downtown. Probably the only complaint I might have is that noise can be a problem - we could hear the person in the room behind ours when he talked on the phone. Of course, that might have just been because he was shouting... Oh - last but not least, they have FABULOUS swag bags for the kids. If you're traveling with little people, make sure you tell staff when you make the reservation.",4
1671,"Beautiful hotel - very modern and stylish decor, front desk and concierge were very friendly and helpful. I didn't give this a five star because our room was tiny. Besides for the size I loved the view and modern amenities.",4
1672,"I cannot believe this place gets such high reviews.  Maybe everyone who gives it 4 or 5 stars stayed in suite??  Or is hard of hearing?  Or enjoys using a converted closet as a bathroom? I only booked this hotel bc I got a special deal, at full price it's a total rip off.  I have no idea what a suite looks like, but the rooms are teensy tiny, even by urban city hotel standards.  The bathroom is even smaller and the sink splashes water on you.  The walls are paper thin, I was woken up at 2 am by a girly laugh fest  (I decided it was the universe paying me back for the hotel guests my friends and I woke at 4am when I stayed at the Hilton in SF).   And the service isn't all that great either.  I put in a request for a rollaway when I checked in and when I went to check on the status was told that they had none available.  I still can't figure out why I can't request one ahead of time.  It took a good 30 seconds of hard staring at the lady bf I got an apology.  I had to ask multiple times for late check out and despite the fact that I got the ok to check out at 1pm, I got a knock at the door at 1230.   Yes, the lobby is beautiful but I'm not sleeping in the lobby.  That hardly makes up for the shortcomings of the place. I loved Chicago and will come back, but def will not stay here again.",2
1673,"Very tasteful and ""funky"" decor.  Staff was super nice.  Wine hour is a wonderful touch.  Rooms were a little on the small side, but larger than I was expecting for a downtown ""historic"" hotel. We had no noise problems (maybe we were the ones making noise for others though?! LOL) Cabs readily available.  Walking distance to Union station and Ogilvie transportation center - and madison st. water taxi.   Overall, nothing was amazingly outstanding, but everything was very nice.",4
1674,"Stayed here for my sister's wedding.  The rooms were nice, and I hear we got quite a discount on them.  There was a computer issue that resulted in us being placed in an occupied room - and then a second time the desk receptionist misheard my name and put us in my aunt's room.  They were extremely apologetic and gave us a $40 voucher for the hotel restaurant as compensation.  It really wasn't that much trouble for us, though. If you join the Kimpton InTouch membership club (free), you get free wifi connectivity in your room as well as Raid the Minibar privileges, which allow you to get up to 2 items, for a total of $10, from the minibar for free. The hotel has a lot of great lounge areas, and the 312 restaurant is good as well (separate review for that).  They did a fantastic job with the cocktail hour and reception, and everything else was great. I've since lost a key to my car, and I've called them numerous times to check back if it's been found, and their lost and found office is fantastic.",4
1675,"I fell in love with this sweet boutique hotel the moment we checked in. The staff was helpful and courteous, and the ""lounge"" serving free wine and beer for happy hour was fantastic- a gorgeous fireplace, modern and funky decor and furniture, and good wine to boot. And the room! The room was AMAZING. Perfect pink and gold striped walls (okay sounds tacky, but trust me, it was DIVINE), beautiful crown molding,a fantastic chaise lounge, luscious brown silk headboards, and gorgeous high thread count bedding. Okay, I have hit my adjective threshold for one review...Suffice to say I was sad to leave after my week stay here.",5
1676,"What can I say... I LOVE this place!! I booked a vacation through Orbitz and this was the hotel that came with the package I chose.  The location is perfect (close to everything you need... restaurants, shopping, theaters) and soooo cute!! Beautiful lobby with free ""wine hour"" every night from 5-6pm (you can't beat that!!) Our room was a little on the small side, but for two people (and the price) it was a DEAL!! The staff was so friendly and helpful too!! The concierge became my best friend that weekend!!  I loved this city (and this hotel) so much I will definately be back SOON!!!",5
1677,"Check into the Allegro for a change from your typical big-name hotel. It isn't a bad spot for a romantic getaway, and since it's possible to hear your neighbors (and vice-versa) hilarity can ensue depending on how mischievous you are. Right in Chicago's theater district, you're conveniently near a Metro stop connecting to many lines, including tourist stops and O'Hare International. The location isn't ideal for breakfast as there are too many chain eateries nearby, and the non-chains aren't open early enough. The lobby and lounge is attractive (dig the eclectic wallpaper), and their happy hour special provides free wine - yes, gratis - to guests from 5 to 6 PM, giving one a chance to mingle, or simply unwind solo. (Besides happy hour vino, we scoured small, pricey bottles of Belvedere from our minibar.) After realizing our dinner plans were a bit unrealistic, a concierge stationed in the lobby (Mark) helpfully found us another place, secured a reservation, and provided us with handy directions. Loved our room's decent view, modern decor, and amenities, like dreamy soft beds, an iPod charger/alarm clock (perfect for having an impromptu party like we did), and a huge flat screen TV - the bathroom's glam, marble counter topped with Aveda products was a nice touch too. (Didn't think the room was tiny, but I don't spend quality time in my hotel room.)",4
1678,"I enjoy the Kimpton Hotel chain- I feel like I know what I am getting, and am rarely disappointed.   Thanks to Yelp - I knew in advance that my room would be teeny tiny- and in the Loop, I wasn't expecting much more.  The room was fully functional for what it was.  The decor was a little interesting - my husband joked that the TV stand/mini-bar looked like they gave a 2 year old a marker and let them go to town.  Bathroom was super small, but had everything I needed and was actually the best decorated part of the room.  Our bathroom sink had an extended counter where there was room for toiletries unlike some of the other reviewers rooms.  We did not have a noise problem in our room whatsoever - I never heard a thing in the hallway or on the other side of the wall.  Wi-Fi is free if you sign up for Kimpton In Touch membership. The lobby is fantastic, especially the hidden sitting room behind the fireplace wall.  I enjoy the Kimpton's hour long wine reception btw 5 and 6.  A perfect starter before heading out into the city for dinner.  They also have a Wii in the lobby which is a great distraction for the younger travelers.  There is both a restaurant and bar in the building as well. The elevator situation is less than ideal - long waits and overcrowded.  I suppose this is to be expected in any tall building - What can you do?  Location in the Loop is nice, and located not too far from access to the El and the subway. My husband gets the government rate - so if you book early enough, can't complain for $158 a night.  It was also an anniversay trip, so the hotel sent a bottle of champagne up to our room free of charge. The only negative at this point - I made a local call from the hotel room - and got charged $1.50.  Not the end of the world, but since when are there charges for local calls??",4
1679,"The Hotel Allegro should have been a five star experience. I mean, what's not to like about a hotel in downtown Chicago, close to everything, especially the theater district, that offers impeccable service in a contemporary environment? Read on, I say. It had been a long day and while I rarely stay in the city since I live here- I was treating my team to a little outing and they wanted to stay in the city so who am I to say no? Due to other commitments, I got to the hotel late and checked in. The lobby is up one level from the street and is decorated in a fun and contemporary way. Know that Kimpton Hotels are pet friendly so I had to maneuver my way around a couple of dogs that had made themselves at home in the front lobby. The desk clerk checked me in quickly and I was in my room moments later. I loved the room layout. I had a corner room with lots of windows, plush pillows on the bed, and a comfy chair. The bed was turned down, the radio on and as I was unpacking my bag I spied two animal print robes in the closet. Rrrrrrrrrrrr! I slipped into one and nibbled a bit on the basket of fruit and cheese that had been sent to the room. Wanting to have a glass of wine to go with it- I went over to the mini bar. It was at this point that I noticed that my mini bar key was broken and no amount of ""finagling"" on my part would open the door. Oh well. I didn't need that wine anyway is what my rational side was saying. My emotional side? Was already whining about no wine! As I settled in for bed- it seemed like a good idea to use the bathroom before I turned in. Imagine my surprise when I flushed and all the water came up instead of going down. Urrgh! Made me think about who the heck was in the room before me? I called down to the front desk and they said they would send an engineer up right away. Oh great. Here I am in my cute leopard print robe. That would never do for a ""visitor"". So I got dressed again to await the man with the steel snake (Trust me. That sounds more interesting than it was!) Other than those two issues and valet parking that was a third of the cost of the room ($48- can you believe that for one night? $42 if you park it yourself) my stay was perfect. Complimentary coffee brought up in the morning, Aveda toiletries in the bathroom, plush towels, chocolates, free wireless, flat screen TV's, everything that I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. And the price was right. You can get a negotiated rate of about $150 - $190 per night which is cheap for this part of town. Would I recommend it? You betcha. Only next time I'm going to flush the toilet BEFORE I put the cute leopard print robe on.",4
1680,"I have never been there, but this is what many of my friends say: Like nothing you've experienced before. Sophisticated, lively accommodations with nine different styles and sizes. Allegro's 483 guestrooms are a modern chorus of color blended with the original Art Deco design. The Allegro is a contemporary American hotel in Chicago's downtown Loop district. Close to everything music, theatre, galleries, restaurants, tourism and nightlife. In the Midwest it's the most intriguing hotel. You'll find it's an experience worth repeating. Hotel Allegro offers thirty-one suites with Jacuzzi tubs and showers. On the top floor is a 900-square foot hospitality suite with sweeping views of Chicago's West Side.

1681,"Ah, the Allegro.  Filled with pros and cons.  The location is pretty decent (although I do hate that pretty much everything in the Loop is closed on weekends.  Come on, Lavazza, work with me here!!).  The lobby decor is definitely more swank than wank.  Apparently there's free wine in the evenings (which I missed, but turns out the glasses are teeny-tiny, so no big loss, I guess).  But the rooms.  Are SO.  SO.  TINY.  Like, maybe even tinier than the wine glasses.  Granted, we crammed four people into a room with two double beds--certainly fun times, but it was like a clown car.  Four people, four suitcases, two beds in a tiny room and a minuscule bathroom (but with Aveda products, woot) makes for a very cramped weekend.  Once I climbed over everyone and their stuff into bed, though, I very much enjoyed the fluffy pillows and cozy bed linens. We attended a wedding at the Allegro, so I can also comment on their event capacity.  The Walnut Room is a nice space for a smaller ceremony, although very dim (maybe that was just this wedding?  I dunno--none of my photos turned out), and the staff is quick to flip the room for dinner and dancing.  Plenty of room for tables, a stage for the band and a dance floor.  I'm assuming the hotel catered the meal, which was good (although I'd pass on the pasta course or be very clear with the kitchen that the pasta should be al dente).  The servers were very inconspicuous and efficient, although maybe too efficient... I'm pretty sure someone swiped my champagne before I had a chance to drink it and I don't think I was being cut off... My last issue is with the baggage check folks.  My husband was given a framed poster as a groomsmen gift which we couldn't haul on the plane home with us.  We arranged to have a city-dwelling friend pick up the poster from the baggage check and we'd pick it up the next time we drove up to Chicago.  The folks at the Allegro were fine with this arrangement, which was a relief.  After Laura B.'s third attempt to retrieve this framed poster from countless clueless baggage check people, Justin had to call the Manager to make sure they still had the item.  They did and it was finally handed over to our friend, but not after numerous wasted trips on her part.  Boo to the baggage people; five stars for Laura for being a great friend and babysitting the poster for us. :)",3
1682,"This hotel was extremely nice for it being downtown. The prices are great and the staff is very friendly. Though this is a pet friendly facility, no pets ever got in our way or were too loud. There's a restaurant called ""321"" hooked up in the hotel. The food is pretty good and the waiters are almost too ridiculously funny and nice. Then there's the Encore bar..which I'm pretty sure only tourists hang out there, so if you're into annoying tourists..I say this is where it's at. OH AND TOURISTS ARE SO RUDE. UNGRATEFUL, AND ANNOYING. I couldn't believe Chicago was filled with such snotty middle class white people in the summer. ANYWAYS...The lobby is really cool! They serve coffee in the mornings, water and ice tea in the afternoon, and wine at night, for free! It's also a cool place to hang out since the rooms are so small. However small the rooms may be, it was a nice room. Most hotel rooms you'll find in ANY city will be that small. Especially at such a good price. I would come here again.",4
1683,"The newly remodeled Allegro is dead sexy.  The small rooms add to its urban feel, and who doesn't like being able to wash her hands WHILE sitting on the toilet.  Spacially, it's like an innovatively planned closet you might find in Tokyo or New York, which suits a short stay or romantic romp just fine.  Stylistically, it's ultra modern and simple - the new classy.  I appreciated the Aveda products and that there WASN'T a $7 bottle of Evian sitting on the night stand.   I'm just realizing in reading other reviews now that the walls are thin.  I hadn't noticed any noises from other rooms...or the El which was practically next door, but  it's probable that, given the booked-to-capacity status of the hotel,  I may owe some neighbors an apology... It may behoove some to know that Allegro is one of many fine establishments you can book on Hotwire for half the price.  Not that you can request it, but it's in the pool anyway.",4
1684,"Location! Location! Location! Finding a hotel in Chicago for labor day weekend was easy...finding a decent and convenient four star spot under $120 was somewhat of a challenge until we discovered Hotel Allegro. It's located in the perfect area in Chicago's Downtown Loop/Theater District-a block away from the CTA subway station, walkable to Millennium Park/Grant Park and a quick stroll to the Magnificent Mile. It's a cute hotel with it's own unique charm. The staff was GREAT! They were nice enough to let us check-in early and not leave us stranded....just 8 hours early at 7:00am! And even more helpful at 3:00am when we were in search of some late night grub- deep dish pizza delivered to our hotel room. Although the room/bathroom was only average and could use another renovation, it was fine for the weekend. They made up for it with their daily complimentary wine hour at 5pm, free in-room Wi-Fi, goose down comforters, fitness center (cardio equipment with TVs) and endless Aveda toiletries!",4
1685,"My company booked a block of rooms for all of us because this was within walking distance to the office. When I first got there, the doormen was extremely nice, took my bags and had it sent to the room. I thought it was a little odd that instead of walking in and checking into my room, that I had to take the elevator to the lobby and then I was able to check in. The lobby itself is pretty big, with a grand piano, beautiful staircase, and lots of seats, its actually pretty cozy. The room itself wasn't bad, it was nothing spectacular. The room was big, but the way the room was set up was very odd. Usually the TV is in front of the bed, but mines was way off to the side. The bathroom was tiny! The sink was so small, that you could probably fit like 2 bottles of something and that is all the vanity space you have. Literally if I was on the toilet, I could reach over on the right and wash my hands in the sink or I could take 1 step over to the left and I'd be in the bathtub. Very small bathroom. With all the space in the room, they should really think about making the bathroom just a tad bigger. Bed was a little springy, but it wasn't bad. The comforter was really thin though. Whats with hotels having thin comforters for!? The hotel uses Aveda products so that's a plus. The fitness room was pretty great too - lots of new machines and clean towels. I didn't like that they didn't have a free business center. $6 bux for 15 mins of Internet usage! That's no good considering the other 2 hotels I stayed in Chicago had free 24 hr business center. But the hotel was clean and nice, staff was friendly, and the location was near work.",3
1686,"You know what?  I am a big fan of Hotel Allegro.  I'm not in creative writing mode today, so you get a list of why they're great. 1. I think our Hotwire price was about $120, but the regular price is only in the $190-ish range. 2. You are right down in the loop, which is super convenient. 3. You can bring your pet with you for no additional charge. 4. The staff is *really* friendly, and not in the fake, we're-only-nice-because-you-pay-us way. 5. The lobby is decorated in a very eclectic fashion.  I'm talkin' hot pink and wavy neon blue velour couches-eclectic. 6. Free wine every day from 5-6pm. 7. Adorable, 1940s-meets-Ikea rooms.  They are technically small rooms, yes, but I thought it was very cozy.  I mean, do you really NEED an enormous hotel room?  Shouldn't you be out enjoying the city or something? 8. Aveda shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizer.  Free! 9. Free New York Times. 10. Comfy bed with extremely comfy pillows & linens. 11. iPod dock/alarm clock! And the best two things: 12. Not only can you get a variety of standard convenience items for free from the front desk, but you can also get ""fashion tape.""  Fashion tape!  So you can tape up your cleavage!  For free! 13. There is always techno bumping in the elevators.  It's like a crazy, eurotrash party at all hours of the day.  11 a.m., 2 pm., 1:30 a.m.....really.  Who doesn't like to have dance parties in elevators? P.S. Not that I'm defending the soggy nachos that another reviewer had, but I'm not sure why they were charged $28.  The price listed for nachos was $11.  I only noticed this because my fiance had mentioned that someone on Yelp got $28 soggy nachos.  So, I'm not really sure what happened there.",5
1687,"The design and over-all look to the place is fun and refreshing from your standard generic hotel fare -- sure to attract many a hipster.  But it seemed like it was mostly old ladies in town to see Tommy Tune in Dr. Dolittle or some other show, as this place is smack dab in the theater district. The price is right, and the staff are actually pretty helpful.  We had a tub that wouldn't drain and by the time we got back from breakfast it was fixed.  Not bad. The TV is the sadly the same 2001 fakey flat screen Toshiba that I have at home -- and it had a bad hissing problem until I figured out the volume settings were all wonky.  But still, not bad.  The wifi was working and the Chivas in the wet bar was only 5 bucks so I was happy. Then came Monday morning.  9 am.  It sounded like a guy was having a wrestling match with his vacuum cleaner outside our door.  Tried as a might to sleep through it, I just couldn't.  The guy was yelling, banging around, vacuuming up a storm, seemingly in the same square foot of carpet right next to our door for at least a half hour.  And right as I'd given up all hope of not having to get out of bed and calling someone -- he moved on.  Not the way you'd want to be woken up after a long night. But aside from that incident and the small nit-picky things, it was a good place to stay.  It was too bad we weren't around for the free wine services -- that seemed like a nice bonus.  I can't say anything about the restaurant or the bar that are next door, they looked a bit over-priced and well, not the kind of places I'd go to.  But those places probably have their own yelp pages.",3
1688,"If you ask the online travel gurus, this is a three-star boutique hotel, but as far as I'm concerned, it's a four star, thanks to all the thoughtful little details. The Allegro is a Kimpton hotel, which means: 1. Free wine reception every evening for guests. 2. Your darling pussies and pooches are as welcome as you are 3. Tootsie rolls are free free free 4. Decor is zany, but tasteful There are themed suites at the Allegro, including a Lion King suite and Second City suite, if you're into that sort of thing. Staff is very friendly. The rooms are great. They can be a bit small, but the comfy beds make up for it. And the bar makes a mean roster of 'tinis. Really good place for girls weekends, bridal parties, etc. Not as romantic as some other hotels in town, but still very cool.",4
1689,"We loved the Allegro Hotel.  The staff was absolutely wonderful, from house keeping, to the front desk staff, the happy hour staff and door service.  They took care of us on many levels: took our picture in the LR all dressed up before we headed to a wedding, kindly obliged at the happy hour to pour a glass of wine that they weren't serving and got it from the kitchen for us, happily steamed my suit after having traveled from the west coast with it in my suit case.  And if that wasn't enough, it was btw, prior to our visit a couple of days, the hotel guest relations head emailed me a personal note welcoming us and offering up whatever it was that we might want and/or need for our upcoming stay.  A very nice touch and great staff at this Kimpton location.",4
1690,"Copying from my old profile. I have never been there, but this is what many of my friends say: Like nothing you've experienced before. Sophisticated, lively accommodations with nine different styles and sizes. Allegro's 483 guestrooms are a modern chorus of color blended with the original Art Deco design. The Allegro is a contemporary American hotel in Chicago's downtown Loop district. Close to everything music, theatre, galleries, restaurants, tourism and nightlife. In the Midwest it's the most intriguing hotel. You'll find it's an experience worth repeating. Hotel Allegro offers thirty-one suites with Jacuzzi tubs and showers. On the top floor is a 900-square foot hospitality suite with sweeping views of Chicago's West Side. Hotel Allegro, like no other Chicago hotel; excitement, ambience and superior value.

1691,"Stayed here on my birthday one year after seeing Aida at Cadillac Palace.  Two seconds into the room I turned around and headed back to the front desk. Being located directly outside of the El was not on my agenda, and I live only 30 minutes away so for that price I would have drove home. They upgraded us to a 4 room suite.  Large at least 10 person tub, elegant sitting room, wonderful robes and slippers - and one of the most comfortable  beds ever.  The room service was ok - I liked ordering from on screen, but the food itself was so-so. Again being a vegan I was limited to a bagel, fruit, and juice. Very friendly and accomodating staff, I would not stay in anything less than a suite here though, the regular rack rooms are tiny and not worth the price being so close to the El",3
1692,"Trying SO desperately hard to be hip and upscale, but there's only so much you can do with a shoebox, I say.   On a sidenote, I once crafted a Star Wars figure village fashioned out of shoeboxes. Spent four nights at the Allegro and I really didn't find anything to complain about, save for the peak time rush hours on the three small elevators.  I also can't find the words to really rave about any particular aspect of the place, either.  It was a solid three-star experience. My room was small and a bit quirky (two separate closets and only three small drawers to work with), but it was clean, quiet, and the bed was comfy.  Huge flat screen TV and iHome were nice touches, but the flat screen is WAY too big for the room I did not unlock the minibar for fear of setting of some kind of remote alarm and starting WWIII, and then getting a bill for having done so. The third star is solidly-earned for the 5:00 - 6:00 FREE wine happy hour.  A very nice touch. I attended a conference in the hotel as well, and all of the various fixin's were ok:  coffee and pastry in the mornings; cookies, soft pretzels, and chips and guac in the afternoons provided a nice variety of sugar rush fixes. All in all, a solid hotel, but $289 per night seemed like a stretch.  This is the third hotel at which I've spent significant time in Chi-town in the past year, and The James still holds the torch.",3
1693,"I was excited when we booked this Kimpton hotel through Hotwire, especially after having a fun experience earlier this year at Hotel Monaco in Denver. I was expecting more free wine and cheese and hotel full of quirky character. I got all that AND a mirror in front of our bed. ""Why is there a mirror on the wall in front of our bed?"" He looked at me when I asked that question. He's not complaining; he loved it that there was a mirror in front of our bed. Cheers to Hotel Allegro for keeping it kinky. P.S. Just valet it if you're staying overnight. $44 for self-park vs. $49 for valet. Yup, that's what we get for staying at a hotel in the Loop.",4
1694,"It's been a few years since I stayed here.  But I recommend it frequently to friends and associates based on the positive experience I had. I prefer the small boutique hotels in general because they tend to be more accommodating and offer cool extras.  Like the wine reception, or how they sometimes have a DJ spinning in the lobby in the evening.   I will say the decor is a little funky and the stripes in the hallway made me feel like I was Alice in Wonderland in that hall that seems to go on forever getting smaller and smaller *lol*. But considering how great the location is and what the median rates are in the city, they're actually quite affordable.  You can (usually) get a room around $199 and considering the Hampton Inn charges more than $200 and doesn't have half the style or amenities I much rather choose the Allegro if it was available.",4
1695,"The Hotel Allegro and I had a 10 month relationship, from 5/2008 until my wedding day in March 2009. We had our ups and downs, but when we finally parted and settled our bill, I couldn't have asked for a better time together. Here are the straight up facts - wedding related, and not. 1. The wedding coordinator, Kerry, despite her insane schedule, got back to me in a reasonable amount of time.  While sometimes I wanted answers ASAP, I had to remember not everyone checks their work email at 6pm Sunday night. Kerry was extremely patient with my now husband and I while we flipped flopped between action stations and a plated meal until the last possible minute.  She understood our situation of planning from out of state and only being able to meet in person a couple times before the big day.  And throughout the process, Kerry was nice, yet didn't give us any B.S. 2. Free Wine Hour. 3. Food = awesome.  Fully surpassed everyone's thoughts on what wedding food usually tastes like.  People are still talking about the mashed potato bar, beef wellington puffs (appetizers), and the pasta bar. 4. Rooms. During my 4 night stay, I was in a spacious suite, but even guests and parents who stayed in regular rooms never complained about the size.  Everything was comfy, clean, and well decorated. Not to mention the location of the hotel was perfect for out of town guests to see Millennium Park, Daley Plaza, ""Marshall Fields"", State Street, etc. 5. Decor.  I heart the decor.  It made for awesome wedding photos! 6. Free Wine. 7. Room Block.  Due to the tanking economy, the Allegro kept dropping their rates.  We had to renegotiate our block rate a couple times, but in the end, everything worked out okay. 8. Free Wine.  Did I say that yet?  Because every guest staying at the hotel thoroughly enjoyed it. After my relationship with the Allegro, part of me doesn't want to stay here ever again.  Why?  Because I had such an amazing wedding weekend, I don't want anything to mess with my memories and current thoughts!",4
1696,"Here is my pro/con list: Pro - Very nice decor - Free wine hour every evening - Nice location in the Loop - LCD TV - Very nice service staff - Free paper if you like Con - Horrible Internet (come on people, Internet needs to be standard, and I'm taking better than what I can get at home) - Rooms are small - They don't use a proper bottom sheet, so the sheets move all over the place (one of my biggest pet peeves)",4
1697,"Def not my 1st choice to stay here but it's 2 blks from my offices, ergo, no-brainer when walking in Chgo in the wintertime.  Valet, bellmen, servers = very cool group of guys.  Each night I came back, whether from office or via cab from dinner, they'd say ""welcome back!"", always calling me by name (love that). The sucky part of the hotel is the actual room (I've stayed here a number of times, it's consistent).  Old A/C wall units will dry you out to a crisp, and a 1 degree change on the thermostat equates to a 10 degree swing.  The bathroom is uncomfortably small, even for a boutique hotel.  It's small, even if you were in Europe at a boutique hotel.  Lilliputian.  The basin is a joke, but at least the shower is made for adult-sized people.  Carpet is old, walls are thin.  Beds are decent though, and if you're an In-Touch member you do get $10 mini bar credit. Fitness center is serviceable so at least you got that going for you.",3
1698,"Why is it that hotels feel they can impress you with a monster lobby and then cram you into a tiny room? I don't know about you, but that just don't seem to add up. In fact, the Allegro doesn't just have one lobby - it has two. You walk in on the ground floor, with a very impressive staircase leading upwards to, wait for it, the real lobby! It's an elegant, gorgeous and spacious room that's well-decorated and filled with people. It actually took me a moment to find the check-in desk, as it was tucked away in the corner of the room. ...or maybe I just got distracted by the free wine bar. As I would later learn, there is a complimentary wine tasting everyday which includes red, white and house sangria. Oh baby. I checked into the hotel, was given my room key, headed upstairs and found - a tiny room. A bed, a TV tucked in the corner and just enough room for a desk and a night table.  When the bathroom doors open, they almost touch the opposite wall. Everything felt cramped in the worst way possible. The room was also decorated with this 1970's wallpaper of a white background with brown circles and squares. I looked at it for a few minutes and actually felt reality start to slip away from me as I slowly began to loose my mind. Thanks Hotel Allegro for that experience. Plus, they had this funky rounded sink that splashed water on me every time I turned it on! Every time! Gah! There was free Internet, which was nice, but you had to first sign up for a really annoying honored guest program to get it. Somehow, I felt less than honored if I had to jump through hoops to get Internet - but that's just me. So, for the splendor and free wine of downstairs, I'm giving a 5, but for the room, I'm giving a 2 - and rounding down to about a 3. And that's what I have to say about that.",3
1699,Free wine.....goooooood Tiny Room....baaaaaad,3
1700,"I've stayed at several Kimpton hotels and I'm a big Kimpton fan.  This one had good service, nice lobby and they quickly brought a yoga mat after I requested it.   The room and decor seem a little long in the tooth, very small and some of the snacks in the minibar (you get 2 up to $10 free when you're an in touch member) were out of date (blech!) Not my favorite Kimpton, but they definitely had the lowest price of the Kimptons in Chicago while I was visiting.",3
1701,"I loved this hotel- it was worthy of dancin on the bed once I plugged my ipod into the docking station/alarm clock. I gotta get me one of those! Upon arrival, my first impressions were of the good location, only a few blocks from the river and Millennium Park. Next, the lobby was decorated very chic and modern. The complimentary wine happy hour in the early evening was perfect. We took a few glasses up to our room after checking in with no problems and were pleasantly surprised with the hip decor of the rooms. The bed looked super cozy and proved later to be just that. The room and bathroom were a little on the smallish side but normal for Chicago standards. The concierge later recommended a great pizzeria for dinner and printed out a map for us to give the cab driver. He also suggested a few tourist things for us to do and reserved tickets for us on the Architectural Boat Tour. Very helpful! Be forewarned, the movies are expensive to rent and watch on the big screen LCD TVs in the room. That's my only complaint!",4
1702,"I am pretty shocked this is a Kimpton hotel. It is sort of like a knock off or half brother of a Kimpton. The room seems run down (wall paper separating, drawer knobs wobbly, base boards beat up, broken toilet). Yes, they had the nice Aveda bath products and nice minibar, but the comparison stopped there for sure. Next Chicago trip, I'll go back to the drake for sure.",2
1703,"My friend's company had an event here, and I went along as his date. This hotel has more of a modern twist to it than, say, the Drake or the Palomar House. The lobby and the suites are decked out in geometric and Art Deco patterns -- some pretty wacky and colorful, but tasteful at the same time. The room was smaller than average and lacked a decent view, but it did have a very nice flat screen TV and French doors leading to the bathroom. The booklets on the desk would have been helpful to me had I been a tourist. We had complimentary drinks in the lobby before dinner, along with some delicious little hors d'oeuvres. The banquet room is a little more old-world looking than the rest of the hotel. All the food was pretty delicious, from the Caesar salad to the chicken to the chocolate cake and coffee. The round tables for eight were nice and roomy. Sometimes I feel squished in and crowded at banquet tables, but not here. After dinner, we had some more drinks at Encore, the hotel bar. The round bar in the middle is nicely designed, and the cocktails are prepared with care rather than quickly thrown together. Bottom line, if you love Art Deco and want to stay somewhere close to the theater district in the city, this may be a good option. But with more classic hotels in the area offering similar prices and more of an old-Chicago atmosphere, I'd rather stay at one of those.",4
1704,"The concierge was so very helpful we enjoyed him very much. the location is great, especially if you like the theater, and there's lots of good shopping and restaurants nearby. Kimpton hotels are fabulous, so, the rooms may have been kind of small, but the decoration and music and attention to detail more than made up for the room size. I enjoyed my stay very much!",5
1705,"Having our wedding at the Hotel Allegro was hands-down the best wedding-planning decision my husband and I made. We checked out a number of historic hotels downtown and left each one feeling pretty ""meh."" We saw blah ballrooms, met with indifferent hotel event coordinators, and we were starting to think we wouldn't find the spot we were looking for, until we saw the Allegro. The ballroom is gorgeous and was perfect for our 150-person wedding. It's modern, but with many historic touches, and we loved the urban feel of having the L go by the ballroom windows during the evening reception (but you absolutely couldn't hear the train). And we got so many compliments from our guests on the food. We didn't hire a wedding coordinator, and yet every part of our wedding went off without a hitch thanks to the amazing Allegro staff. From the doormen to the bellhops to the desk staff, I have never met a friendlier and more helpful group of hotel employees.  The catering/event staff in particular made the entire experience painless. My feelings were reaffirmed when my husband and I came back to the Allegro to reshoot our wedding photos recently. Shortly after our wedding, we found out our photographer had lost our wedding photos (wedding tip: when researching photographers, ask them how and when they back up their photos).  We decided to throw on the ol' tux and white dress and take some new photos with a new photographer, and when I contacted catering managers Kerry and Alyssa they couldn't have been more sympathetic or helpful. When we came by to retake the photos they surprised us with the hospitality suite for the afternoon (easily one of the coolest hotel rooms in the city) and a bottle of bubbly. We got some great photos in the suite, lobby and ballroom. Kerry and Alyssa really helped make an unfortunate situation fun and memorable -- four whole months after our event.   The Allegro is a fun, stylish hotel all on its own, but the staff is what makes it a particularly special place for an event.",5
1706,"I didn't stay long enough to get find out how everything was, but honestly how can you screw up a one night stay?  Well I'm sure there are ways.  But overall I had a good stay.  The decor was that of a Kimpton - eccentric and themed.  They wanted you to feel like a rock star so the decor reflected that.  The bathrobes in the closet were leopard print and zebra print.  There was Mr. Bubbles bubble bath for the bath.  My favorite amenity was the Aveda products.  I also had a end suite which had a separate sitting room area complete with an oversized round stool in the entry way. I ordered room service for breakfast and that was probably a mistake.  The coffee was terrible, tasted pretty water down so I didn't finish it.  It was also pretty spendy but room service usually is.  Don't order fruit yogurt, they take plain yogurt and add strawberry jam to it - or at least that's what it looked like.",3
1707,"There's a certain ridiculousness about this place.  The decor is absurd.  It's like some sort of satanic Eyes Wide Shut wannabe mixed with Ikea mixed with some Ansel Adams/Norman Rockwell musical-note visual art (no nod to actual MUSIC however, unless you count the date-rape disco being piped into the lobby area).   THE ROOMS ARE TINY!!!  I reserved the room online and wondered why it was so cheap for the area, but the web photos looked so nice.  Well, because it's like a 10 x 7 ft. room with a dinky washbasin in lieu of a sink, cruise-ship style.  FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT STAY IN ONE OF THE REGULAR ROOMS WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON FOR ANY EXTENDED PERIOD!  You could go nuts enough to write in a bunch of ALLCAPs at the memory. I did appreciate the power strip embedded in the side of the desk.. They have a drink at their bar called the ""Crimson Cooler"" -- it's made with organic hibiscus infused vodka, muddled organic strawberries, organic agave nectar, and thai basil.  It's my perfect drink.  The bar was closed to the public though for private parties half the time we were there, which was rather disappointing and annoying. I'll be trying another hotel next time I visit the windy city. (I feel like such a honkey writing this review.)",3
1708,"Let me preface by saying - this hotel may not be for everyone - this is BOUTIQUE hotel, not a chain. They just had a some odd million renovation (which is absolutely gorgeous) but it still has its quirks and I like that. Came here late on Valentines Day 09 as the last part of a surprise evening from my husband. Upon entering, someone offered to take my bags, we bypassed because we only had a couple. My husband breezed through check-in while I sat in awe of the lobby (if they the movie ""Cool World"" was redone for this decade - this lobby would be in it). I'm sure the rooms vary in size, but we got a huge corner one with enough room for me to do if a flip flop ( I would assume if I were a gymnast). The room had the usual modern updates - iPod clock radio, plasma TV, soft robes, etc, sleek furniture and decor. I felt like a princess as I sat in one of the zebra stripped robes they had in the hall closet while I sat back and sipped on a tiny bottle of Grey Goose from the Minibar. We got room service the next day - I had eggs benedict and my husband the steak and eggs - both were delicious - my limited experiences with room service has been questionable at best so I happy to have warm tasty food that didn't feel like it was just cranked out on a convey er belt (because I mean, it was the morning after Valentine's Day - I'm sure 90% of the hotel was getting room service!) All in all - I loved it. Not all the Kimpton Hotels have as much character as this one - so if you're going to go the Kimpton route - go for the Allegro.",5
1709,"Stayed here Valentines Night and was very pleased. The rooms are very modern and hip--as is the whole Hotel. We thought the size was just right for a nights stay, or even for a weekend. We loved having the iHome and the huge TV. The bathroom is a bit small, but you aren't sleeping in there, are ya? One of the best accommodations about this hotel was the complimentary breakfast--it is one of a kind. It is not the typical doughnuts and coffee table. It is a little bar area that a woman controls. Each person gets a juice, coffee or tea, a piece of fruit, and some kind of bakery good. Each item was fresh and delicious. And we loved the spunky seating area.",4
1710,"One word: classy. The first thing that sounds out about this place is the decorations. It's decorated like a tripped out Ikea mixed with some urban castle madness. Michael approves. They charge $45/day for parking. In their defense, this seems to be about the going rate for the nearby garages. Still, Michael does not approve. I arrived way before check in time and they didn't even mention it and got me into a room right away. Michael approves. As others have mentioned - they have essentially a free happy hour every day. Michael approves. I had something mailed there ahead of when I arrived. They didn't think they had gotten it till I harassed them about it (being that tracking showed it delivered) and then they finally found it. Michael definitely does not approve. They catered to all my bizarre demands (even the one regarding pigs blood and goats), and even turned down a tip when offered. Michael approves. When you call them - there is no ""dial 1 for this, dial 2 for that"". A real person picks up. Michael approves so much. So very much. Free Internets. Approve Michael does. Comfy beds, comfy rooms. Michael approves. I expect to return.",5
1711,"It's been a long arse day of traveling and all you wanna do is get into that hotel room for a minute and decompress. I had originally reserved at Hotel Burnham but due to a snafu on their part, they had to send me over to Hotel Allegro. So, into a cab I go for yet another leg of my journey (it was so close I could have walked easily but I didn't argue when cab fare was shoved in my hand.) I was a little annoyed at the change but all that was gone when I walked into the lobby. Hell-o there, gorgeous! If you've ever stayed in a Kimpton, you can expect business as usual here. Free wine in the evenings, ultra cool, plush, and fashionable digs, the best in technology (iHome, free wireless, HD flat screens), mostly helpful and pleasant staff, and room service orders you regret in the morning. I also really like their pens. They rank up there with Yelpstick as being an all time favorite tschotske. Highlights: - lucked out with a crazy huge room, super clean, very comfortable, and quiet - one bell hop in particular was a ray of sunshine and was supremely helpful with bags and directions - animal print robes for sassy relaxation times (see photo ;) Lowlights: - the other hotel sent over a bottle of wine for their mistake (how'd they know I'm easily placated with alcohol?) and I didn't have the minibar key to access a corkscrew. I called down to have it brought up and it never showed so I eventually had to go down myself. - valet parking is exorbitant (no self park) and other options in the area are nearly as bad. Best to leave the car out of it or plan for paying that much. - front desk staff can be a leeetle bit snooty. I paid $100 (with a lil help from my friend Mr. Shatner) and with taxes it was around $128 for a Friday night stay. I would definitely recommend if you have business in this area of the Loop or just want to stay somewhere with a fair amount of personality and pretty high standards.",4
1712,"Strengths: Hotel was trendy and clean.  Staff was pleasant.  Gym was nicely sized and equipped.  Hosted happy hour was AWESOME. Weaknesses:  The location is not that great.  Yes, this is in the Loop, but in hindsight, as a tourist we should've stayed north of the river.  The bathrooms are pretty tiny. Opportunities:  More leniency with the hotel restaurant vouchers would be nice :) Threats:  Being that I'm a first time visitor, I cannot compare with other local hotels.  I would say that this Kimpton was much cleaner than the one I stayed in when I was in DC. Total:  $89 per night",4
1713,"This hotel is nice, Its got great, fun, style. The lobby is really nicely done. I like the way the room looked but the bathroom sink was tiny. The King size bed was perfect, so comfy in fact that I looked for the brand on the mattress for my own house. The staff were great too. I do have a major issue though and thats the fact that I remember being in this hotel in 1995 and I was BLOWN AWAY with the original Art Deco style of this building. Now, only the elevator doors remain. It breaks my heart to see the destruction of architectural heritage. I dont know if it was the Kimpton people or some other company that ""remodeled"" this place but I cant think of anything else when I walk through it.",3
1714,"It is funny, I did not appriciate this hotel as much until I stayed at a few other places.  I originally thought it was small rooms and that was about it... but read on. The more times I stayed here, the more I enjoyed it.  First off, I have always found the service to be great.  I feel welcomed when I check in, and feel like they appriciated my stay when I check out.  That is big... hotels are a service industry and many lose sight of that!  Overall, I would say the service here is top notch (and I have stayed at many of the more pricey places in the area too). The rooms could be hit or miss... but are always clean and everything is working order.  The closets can be small or not there, so when checking in be sure to make sure you get a room with a decent closet if you are staying a few days!  I have had tiny rooms, regular rooms and suites.  The suites are very large BTW. Here are the downsides or things to watch for (and again, I am giving it 4 stars so you could see it does not matter too much): No coffee makers in the room... I have coffee 24/7 so that is a bit of a challenge.  There is a Dunkin Donuts next door though, no biggie. The elevators could be SLOW during peak times.  If you need a speedy exit, choose a low floor or something close to the stairs. If you like it uber quiet, be sure to ask for something away from the trains. Upsides: Aveda bath soaps.  Sure it is a small thing, but they are nice products and not cheap. iHome alarm clocks (I forget if all rooms have them or just the suites).  Charge your iPod and wake up to your music.  Good stuff! Nice TV's.  I never turn mine on, but if you are a TV nut they are good. Eco-Friendly:  I'm not a tree hugger... but if you are the non-leg-shaving type you might admire their efforts! Free wine hour/happy hour:  Usually have some good apps and wine plus some seasonal drinks (spiked hot toddy the last time) Helpful staff:  Always a plus! Well done Kimpton and Allegro.  I'm sitting in your room as I type this, back for maybe my 15th stay here.  For 1/2 the price of some of the other spots, I'm glad I stay with you!",4
1715,"If you are youngish and want to have a little fun, DO NOT STAY HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!  I knew it was trendy and seemed like a cool place, so I didn't eat for weeks to be able to afford one of their stupid $400 suites so I could throw a small after-party on new years eve.  But when we checked in, they gave us a little list of absurd rules, the two most absurd being (1) no outside food or drink, and (2) only registered guests after midnight would be allowed - ID would be checked at the door!  We managed to sneak in food alcohol and people anyway, but that involved quite a bit of effort and additional debauchery, and it wouldn't necessarily work again.  They kept blaming the ridiculous rules on ""security"" and ""fire hazard"" but no other hotel in the city was so strangely paternalistic.   Also, I ate $9 worth of food from the minibar, but they charged me $20!  When I called about it, they just asked what I ate and said, OK, we'll change it.  It sounds like they just try that and see how often they can get away with it. Another con is the location - it's not really close to anything but the theaters - for the price, you'd be better off staying in a much more central location.   One more con - our suite was supposed to have a ""two-person jacuzzi"" - it was just a bathtub with some extra spray-jet things.  Bogus!  Only two very small children could fit in there comfortably. I will say though that the suites are pretty awesome - they have this crazy rock'n'roll'coke vibe with a big portrait of a guitar and 80s patterned wallpaper.  And two nice flat-screen TVs.  And these trippy animal-print robes.",2
1716,"We stayed here 3 nights on our first trip to Chicago, not really knowing the neighborhoods or preferred locales. To our surprise the hotel is in a great location, walking distance to a lot of restaurants. If you need to go further out, a $5 cab ride will get you there. Encore Liquid Lounge was a perfect spot for us to unwind that first night, as well as a good starting point every night thereafter. This is a renovated hotel, so you need to come with proper expectations. You can tell this is a very old building, with rooms that are very small compared to newer hotels. But that's the way it was back then and I've experienced the same in similar hotels in other cities. Given all that, they've done an excellent job on the renovation. The rooms are clean and up-to-date. The bathrooms are beautiful. The lobby is done really well and makes a great place for the nightly wine-hour. The standout for us was the staff. From the front desk to the cleaning staff, everyone was incredibly considerate and polite. We always ask everyone besides the concierge on what to do and where to go. Julio gave us great recommendations and presented genuine thoughtfulness. Definitely seek this gentleman out. We would and have recommended this hotel to others with proper expectations in mind. For the price, this is a great value. *I've seen other reviews with complaints about the thin walls and noisy hallways. Luckily for us, we didn't experience any of that. I know we had neighbors on both sides, but other than a door closing, didn't hear a peep.",5
1717,"This is a pretty good hotel for the Loop, but I think I came at the wrong time. It was way too crowded, the elevators took FOREVER, and the gym was packed to the gills. It's understandable that the gym and lobby would be busy with a full hotel, but the elevator problem was a real hassle and very frustrating. I waited maybe 25 minutes to only have the elevator finally come, but so jam-packed that I couldn't get on. (Walking down 19 flights in heels didn't appeal to me that day...) Apart from that, the hotel is in a good location, the rooms are clean quiet, and the staff is friendly. Housekeeping responded so quickly when I called about my broken iron, and the front desk gave me great advice on finding a yummy pizza restaurant. Overall, not a bad stay.",4
1718,"I'm a fan.  I was looking for a business hotel for one night in central Chicago. First the location is great.  2 blocks from the Blue Line metro stop which runs straight for the airport.  It's close to Millenium Park where I'm going jogging in the morning, and close to the offices of the businesses I'm visiting. The hotel has been recently remodeled and upgraded.  The lobby is plush and comfy; the $109 room I got from http://Kayak.com was clean, modern, although not super big. Surprisingly this was the 2nd least expensive option available.  The cheapest option had abysmal Yelp reviews, everything else for $30 or $40 more didn't have stellar reviews either.  Allegro is a good middle of the road choice for the casual business traveler. What I also liked, and which prompted me to give the 5-start rating, is that they didn't nickle and dime me for things that should be a commodity.  I can't stand it when hotels charge me $10+ for 24 hours of wireless access.  The Allegro has free wireless if you sign up for their (free) customer loyalty program.  That's a fair trade.  Same with things like toothbrushes.  I'm always annoyed when I stay at a $150+ a night place and they charge me $5 for toothpaste.  That's just ridiculous.  The Allegro actually has a list posted in the bathroom of the toiletry items that are free (all the most common ones are) and the ones they charge for like nail clippers.  And the fee is moderate too. Tumbs up also for the fluffy duvets and super comfortable bed. It seems run by conscious people that care about the customer experience.  Recommended.",5
1719,"One of my friends in Chicago was diagnosed with kidney disease and I desperately wanted to see him.  So, we shopped around online and landed a good deal with Hotel Allegro.  Our flight to Chicago was scheduled to arrive at 7:30 am.  We called the hotel and asked if we could have early check-in and explained to her the reason of our visit. The manager on duty was terrific and extremely helpful. Since the hotel was not fully booked, it was no problem checking in at 8 am with no extra charge. Now, that's a service!  To top it all off, she did a research before we arrived and gave us a list of flower shops, in case we want to get some flowers for our friend in the hospital. Yes, the room was small.  But it was beautifully decorated, with touches of modern and glam decor. Marble bathroom and vanity.  It was clean.  The bed was comfortable.  Good location and fairly quiet at night. Our verdict?  We would definitely stay there again.",4
1720,"I'm attaching my review from TripAdvisor. I love this hotel. I just find it very charming. I love the new decor, and the location is great. Front desk staff is always friendly and helpful. Valet's good too - there was this guy Chuck at the valet when I stayed here a few months ago and he was just the nicest guy. Haven't seen him the last 2 times I stayed here though. Also ordered room service for breakfast once and it was great. Like others have mentioned, the rooms (and sinks and closets) are definitely smaller, but in my opinion they're enough for 2. I've stayed here with my partner for over a week before and we had everything we needed (although a microwave would have been nice). It just sort of feels like living in New York, you have to be neat and make sure every space is being used. I've also stayed at the King suite before - nice separate living room space, but you can only sleep 1 comfortably on the sofa bed. My friends opted to lay the pillows on the floor and slept on the floor instead. I get the feeling that the hotel doesn't have all its processes down yet. Sometimes I make requests (such as pillows or pet bowls) and they take a long time to be fulfilled. Sometimes it takes multiple reminders, and sometimes it takes me to be proactive by going downstairs to the front desk. They certainly seem to be improving everytime I stay here though. and if anything does go wrong, the staff does its best to remediate the issue, an effort which I am appreciative of. My biggest issue with the hotel is its thin walls. Of my stays here, I've heard neighbors' passionate nights to phone conversations, and I'm not even a light sleeper. My worst experience was when my neighbor decided to wake up to Josh Groban 45 minutes before I wanted to wake up. An unfortunate incident likely resulting from being in an older building, but somehow I still like this hotel a whole lot and keep going back. I now request for quiet rooms in my Kimpton profile, and it seems to have helped in my most recent stay.",4
1721,"We booked our hotel through Hotwire, and I think the price we ended up paying for our room was a fair one. First of all, Hotel Allegro was super convenient, just a few blocks away from the blue line stop where our tired, weary feet emerged late the night of our arrival. The neon blue sign for the hotel was never more welcoming at that moment! The staff were also really helpful, friendly, and courteous and gave us some good recommendations of a place that would deliver to the hotel (it was really late and everything closes SO early in Chicago!). It was very convenient and easy to get to other places in the city from it, making excursions easy and convenient. My first impression of the room was that it was ridiculous. In a good way, mind you, but ridiculous nevertheless. Cream colored wallpaper with bright silver designs, a gigantic distressed glass mirror directly in front of the bed (hmm), which itself was pretty ridiculous with its blue velvet headboard and a large black bureau and minibar, with a huge flatscreen tv. Maybe I'm silly, but I really enjoyed the room. It was just ridiculous enough to be fun, and although all of the furniture took up most of the space, it was decorated loudly enough for a room twice its size. I didn't really mind the smallness of the bathroom either, although if we had been staying longer or for it might have gotten cramped. The bed was comfy, the thermostat adjusted the temperature of the room in a flash, and I felt like the room and bathroom were well cleaned before we arrived. The only bad thing was the room service. The guy who brought it up was pleasant and I guess I should have expected it to be expensive but I was NOT prepared to pay $28 for soggy, gross nachos without any salsa. We only ordered it because it was getting late and we were desperate but YIKES. For $28 they could at least make it a decent plate of nachos. All in all, I'd probably stay again, but I will NEVER use their room service.",4
1722,"I've stayed here twice when visiting Chicago with boyfriends and it's been awesome. Each room is totally different, very stylish and mod, and still inexpensive. They're on the small side, but generally, when I'm at a hotel, I've found that I spend very little time in it so it didn't bother me. I also have to say that I really love Kimpon hotels, and I've stayed at one in Dallas and thought it was quite nice too. I will say that on the downside, the walls are quite thin. I can sleep through anything, but those of you that can't, watch out!",4
1723,"Thank you for giving me the worst room on the planet. The website for this hotel was so gorgeous that my friends came expecting to be awed...instead what I got was probably the worst room in the entire hotel. It was the size of my college dorm room, the bathroom can be more or less described as an 'efficiency' and my view (way up high on the 10th floor)...brace yourself...was of a parking lot across the street. What made it worse was that it was 2 steps from the elevator so all I heard during the night were the dings of people going up and down. Which brings me up to my next point...I had 2 friends over to watch tv for a few hours before going out and management called my room 4 times to complain about the 'noise level'.  At one point they said 'we are going to have to ask you to leave if this keeps up' ...not a great thing to say to a guest? especially when that guest has to listen to the elevator all night. In summary, this hotel should not be considered a 4 star. I've stayed at holiday inns that were much more quiet, considerate and BIGGER. Maybe they just like to yank my chain because I bought it off of priceline but at this price point, I would've been better off putting up an extra 50 to be pampered, not insulted.",1
1724,"I took my lady to Hotel Allegro for a ""staycation"" here in Chicago, and we had such a great time!  The room was small, but it was so wonderfully decorated and hip, that it didn't even matter.  The staff were all very friendly with good senses of humor, and we loved the free wine hour and free hot cocoa/coffee (I recommend half of each to get a mocha going).  : ) I stayed at a 4 and 1/2 star hotel a month later and didn't have nearly as good of an experience as I did at Allegro.   It's a really good spot in every respect.",5
1725,"Review for bar only. this place gets four stars for only its decor and vibe.  very fun, and i would have never thought to go here if not for someone suggesting it.  we had a great time and i would totally consider going here again for happy hour or a pre- or post-play drink.",4
1726,"Really?  For a 3-star hotel I get... a noisy hallway, the binging of the elevator clearly audible in my room, the world's teeniest room with smaller yet bathroom, long waits for the elevator, a crowded lobby, a swamped front desk staff and half the lobby blocked off for a private event. Harumph. We chose this place because they're dog friendly, but the accoutrement that according to their website were supposed to come to our pooch were complete no-shows.   Instead, the noisy hallway and banging of doors and elevator noises kept her up all night, pretty much ruining any chance of sleep. So the decor is quirky.  And for $1 extra you can get ""continental breakfast"" (really, just Costco mini muffins and danishes).  But it ain't all that.",3
1727,"Stayed her for a night a few months back as a sort of mini-vacation.  Dumb reason?  Maybe.  Tacky? Probably.  But whatever, I didn't have any vacation time left! We were very impressed with the friendly, courteous and professional staff.  The room was decked out like a little apartment with seperate dining, living, and bathroom areas, all spotless.  The iPod docks are a cool treat, as well as the double sized whirlpool tub ;-) I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone from out of town or people who are spending an evening downtown from the suburbs, you can consider it as treating yourself!",4
1728,"I had an average experience at the Allegro Hotel. The staff was all very courteous, and you can expect good service. However, the carpet in my room was wet. Seems like they just deep cleaned it and didn't give it enough time or ventilation to dry. The decor is a little quirky - I felt a little like Alice in Wonderland, kind of bewildered by the bright colors and patterns, but some would call that character. Also, they have Aveda products in the rooms. Eee! It's been a few years since I've stayed there, so I don't know if they still stock the bathroom with Aveda stuff. But I loved it.",3
1729,"I really like the Kimpton hotel chain.  When coming to Chicago, this is a perfect hotel for me.  I like the unusual decorating, it's much better than the boring styles of most hotels.  I have to admit I am a HUGE sucker for the free wine each night.  Obviously, it isn't great wine, but it's free and a good way to start your night. The location was good for us.  We didn't hear the El, like another reviewer mentioned.  It wasn't right on the Mile, but that was fine.  We didn't mind walking a bit.  The conceirge was great about giving us restaurant recommendations that turned out to be winners.   Our room here was VERY small with a small bathroom as well.  It was recently redone and everything was lovely.  The bed was incredibly comfortable with high quality sheets and comfy duvets.   I haven't been back but will probably stay there when we return to Chicago.",4
1730,Don't be fooled by the photos on Expedia or http://Hotels.com.  They are experts at Photoshop.   Debbie Downers: 1)The room was extremely small 2)They had an odd odor ( as if it wasn't cleaned properly). 3) The bed was uncomfortable and linens needed to be replaced 4) Nice sink but why didn't they replace the shower head 5) Bad water pressure. Yay: 1) Lady who checked me in was very nice. 2) Opening wine welcoming is a nice touch. 3) Historical building converted into hotel.,2
1731,Beautiful hotel. I walk dogs and have had the pleasure of walking in this hotel The staff is nice.  the rooms are a little small..but i guess if your going to be in a hotel you dont need a HUGE room. But they are Aokay!,4
1732,"I stayed here on a recent business trip. Typically I just stay at a Starwood to rack up the points, but my company has a new partnership with Kimpton Hotels so I thought I would try it. What a great alternative to the standard hotel. The service was amazing, even checking ahead of time to see what type of pillow I would like in my room and how many. I was plesantly greeted when I arrived, and went up to a nice sized, clean (although a little brightly colored) room. The beds were unbelievable comfortable and even though I typically have a very difficult time sleeping when traveling- I got a great night sleep. The best part about my stay was meeting a friend down in the hotel bar. We were going to go out, but due to cold weather we just decided to get a drink at the hotel. The brightly colored lounge played great music and had the feel of taking you to another era. The staff was friendly and martinis tasty and the whole atmosphere had the feel that you could walk up and sit with anyone in the bar and strike up a conversation. ADDITION Jan. 12, 2007: I just stayed again at this hotel... and here are some more things I love... the hotel is pet friendly (I didn't bring a pet) but I have recently learned that all Kimpton hotels seem to be pet friendly even the really upscale, expensive ones. They have a power strip next to the mirror so you don't have to climb under things and unplug lights to plug in your curling iron, they ask you what type of pillow you would like (it's the little things), and did I mention they have a complimentary wine hour after work... ADDITION: July 19, 2007- Just got back from my fourth trip to Chicago in the past 7 months and another stay at Allegro. Hotel was still great and remains one of my favorites, but this time I happened to be there on a weekend when it was 100% booked. I had never noticed the hotel being noisy before- but this time I had to call down to quiet down the room next to me (the hotel sent someone up right away and then they were quiet so it wasn't a big deal), but then on my fourth morning at the hotel a baby was crying at 5AM in the room next to me. There was not muffling of the sound between my room and theirs- the baby sounded like it was literally in a crib two feet from my bed. Still a great hotel- but noise is definitey a concern if the hotel is crowded.",5
1733,"Booked this hotel at a GREAT rate through hotwire.   The hotel seemed to be in a good location. About 20 minutes from Midway. The welcome was wonderful! My first visit to Chicago and the front desk people were very helpful with how I could get around the city and some great places to see while I was there.  Over the next four days they showed that they remembered me specifically. The room was perfect. Not too big, not too small. Well equipped and very comfortable! The only downside is that they seem to rent out what should be common areas to groups. I had arranged to meet a friend that I hadn't seen since we were children in the lobby on evening. When I arrived back at the hotel to find her... she was lost in a sea of conventioneers.  We did find each other of course... we were the two people looking confused. I would recommend it to anyone. :)",4
1734,"The customer service is EXCELLENT and cost was great (got my room for only $127 a night on Travelocity). I think they've got a litle happy hour in the evenings as well, but I didn't take advantage. The location is ideal and central to a lot of downtown attractions. Oh, and did I mention free internet??? You have to join their Kimpton program, but it's a snap. The rooms are charming, Art Deco-ish, and Euro-sized but that's cool as long as you're not a bigger person. The one thing that I would change about this hotel is the soundproofing. It gets kind of loud sometimes!",4
1735,"I just had my wedding at Hotel Allegro and it was perfect! I cannot say enough good things about Kerry Craig, their wedding coordinator.  Kerry was on top of things on day 1.  She is organized, professional and so nice to work with.  My husband and I could not have done this without her.   The food was really good (every guest said something about it) and I feel like their prices are comparable to others around town.  The rooms are a bit small but very nice and the room block rate was amazing.  It was a great venue that I would highly recommend to anyone.  I would not have changed a thing about my wedding and I definitely thought that the venue was beautifully done.",5
1736,"Pricey, big lobby, rooms are small though, nice bathroom, clean, nice TVs, very nice fitness center. Location is good. Would probably try another hotel on our next stay in Chicago though.",4

1738,"Yukon XL with a full tank of gas?  Check.  ""In the Heights"" tickets for the Cadillac theatre RIGHT next door?  Check.  Your teenage daughter and a whole group of your girlfriends?  CHECK! We stayed here at the Hotel Allegro due to its close proximity to the theatre. We drove from Madison WI to take in a show, go salsa dancing and treat ourselves to an over nighter in the Windy city. While we thought we left in plenty of time we were still stuck on the Kennedy at 7:15 while curtain was said to go up at 7:45 that evening.  Crap! No worries; I got off on Cumberland and took the streets into downtown.  We pulled up to the Hotel at 7:38PM.  Yeah - I know right?  The doorman and bell person were ON POINT.  We simply hopped out, opened the trucks hatch, they took my last name and our bags, gave us 2 tickets; one for the valet and one to pick up out luggage upon check in.   Nice! We walked 7 seconds to the show next door with NO worries. Upon arriving back at the hotel to check in; we were given double bed rooms on a high floor as requested; small rooms but hell it was efficient.  We ordered room service, laughed loudly with no repercussions from the neighbors or the front desk, and when we went out dancing it didn't take forever for them to bring the wheels around. We all had a great time and would return.",4
1739,"You can't beat the location, but the striped wallpaper in the long hallways almost gave me a case of vertigo.   The gym equipment is better than most hotels, and you can usually find pretty good rates online.",4
1740,"Definitely caters to a clientele that likes it a bit trendy, a bit posh, a bit funky. The staff were super nice and helpful, in a genuine way, which is notable in my book. Our room was a bit on the small side, but it didn't bother us a bit, we made it work. - we travel light (like each of us has a small backpack for four days kinda light), so we didn't have a problem making our stuff fit.   We got a great rate online which really made this hotel experience rock my world. I have to say, if we paid full-on rates, I'm not sure the amenities would be worth it for me. The wine hour was pretty sweet too. Free wine, a bit of food to nosh on, people watching, what could be bad about that?",4
1741,"Hotel Allegro is the one shining light in my whole Chicago trip.  I knew I could depend on Kimpton to save the day.  As with all Kimpton properties, the hotel is very chic and the rooms have personality.  I booked a double room under a promotional code, so rate was about $119/night, which I think is a great deal for the location.  It's close to the CTA, so traveling around is super easy.  The only negative I can think of is thin walls, but I can live with it since I'm a deep sleeper.",4
1742,"The decor is unique. It's out there - definitely clashing wallpapers , furniture, and colors, but it works. As for the rooms..they're tiny. And the bathrooms are tinier. The sink in the bathroom is awkward because it doesn't have a lot of depth...so washing your face means splashing water on your legs too. Some of us actually opted to wash our faces/brush our teeths in the bathtub because it was less messy. A really important note: THE WALLS ARE SUPER THIN. You can hear everything. Let the staff know - they'll probably comp your room for you.",2
1743,"Hate this hotel.  It is basically an old dump that has been dressed up with some snazzy decors.  The bathrooms are horrendous in the rooms...barely functional.  My room had a horrible perfumey (almost like the car christmas tree smell) scent to it.  The location inside the loop is nice, but there is nothing to do down here at night.  I always avoid this hotel when I can.  The Wit is 1000x better hotel.",2
1744,"The 5-6pm free wine happy hour is getting to be the standard at hotels the world wide.  Hotel Allegro has a gorgeous multi-room lobby space where they offer their version of happy hour and it's definitely what stood out most about my stay.  There's a Wii, which is a great conversation starter and a fun idea in general. After checking in and seeing the lobby I was a bit disappointed by the room.  The decor was nice, but the room was quite small and unfortunately the view, even from the 18th floor, was an eyesore.  But I've come to learn that's pretty much par for the course in Chicago.  Otherwise, the snack bar offered some healthy, organic treats and the toiletries weren't tested on animals which is important to me. The gym is impressive for a hotel and I was able to get a decent workout.  I didn't eat in the attached restaurants in part because the breakfast was outrageously expensive.  A coupon for dinner is provided for the attached restaurant, but I didn't have an opportunity to eat there.  The menu looked decent. I would stay here again and recommend it for sure.  I found a great deal on http://hotels.com, it's in a great location near an L stop and the shopping district on State Street, and I looked forward to coming back to Allegro after work each day.  The only qualm I have is the surcharge to use the internet.  In this day in age, most travelers bring their laptops everywhere they go and it's a common courtesy for any hotel to provide free internet access.",4
1745,"As a positive the hotel itself is in a decent location, located in the financial district. Keep in mind that a lot of places roll the carpet up at 9pm because of this location. There is a bar next door to the hotel but it was not open on Sunday...or at least the Sunday I was there. The rooms are very small, the decor is nice and everything was very clean. They do not have a restaurant onsite but to offer limited room service. The rooms are equipped  with stocked mini bar and snacks. Wifi is available as well. All and all a very decent stay especially suited for people who will be out exploring all day.",3
1746,"Let me preface by saying I work for a hotel brand that is not Kimpton.  I made last minute plans to head back to Chicago and decided on the Allegro.  Great Choice.  I used to live in Chicago for many years so I know the layout and CTA well so it was nice to have a hotel which was very accessable so that I wouldn't have to rent a car. Like a few other people who booked there, I was expecting a room that was smaller, I guess I'm used to many historic type hotels rooms in NYC which have basically enough room for the bed and a little walking space, nice molding on the walls but not a whole lot of space to walk lol.  I had a premier king room which basically was a king room with a little more space, well, I had plenty of space.  Nice amenities (Aveda), housekeeping is fantastic as they cleaned my room somehow when I wasn't there.  I was impressed because I was in and out throughout my 3 day stay and never saw them in my room.  I was also impressed by the fact that I looked down onto the L tracks but never heard the train.  Maybe I was too immersed in my work but it definately wasn't like some street noise I've encountered at many other hotels.  Room service, the person answering the phone was very thorough and the food was fast, hot and correct.  The hotel is very conveniently located so that if you want to see/go anywhere in the loop you can really walk.  If you need to hop on the L, its centrally located to Wells and the Lake st stops.   Points to help out When you first walk in, there is a flight of stairs which you have to go up to get to the main lobby Definately join InTouch before you check in Use the hotels services ie concierge, fitness room",4
1747,"3.5 stars I just checked out. We stayed here for mini one night get away. There is no doubt that the service is good. Room service was very nice and so was the front desk. The couple of complaints I have are mainly about the room. I was given a mini bar key, but there was no mini bar, wtf? Ok, I can live with no booze...but the room also felt a little grimy and small.  I don't think I'd stay here again, unless I was staying in a clean suite.",3
1748,"Wonderful hotel! Beautiful scenery, friendly staff, and free wine/ internet.",5
1749,"This is a great hotel which is rather unique. The big CON is they have small rooms. It's a renovated older hotel so its not like they designed it this way to begin with but it was rather tight. I, for one, don't mind since I rarely stay in my room that long... I am a up and about type person. For some people, this is a big deal since they need a large room. Don't let that deter you though. The staff here is great. Very helpful, very service minded. They mailed a post card for me an gave me an umbrella when I asked where I could buy one. My friend got upgraded to a suite because they made a small mistake. These are good service minded people. I like the decor but it could be a bit much for some people who like a more traditional feel (Kimpton hotels are mostly like this though, its their thing). As other people have mentioned, they have wine every day for an hour or so. Really really really cool of them. It's also a good way to meet other guests. If you get a deal on this hotel... I'd say check it out.",4
1750,"I really liked this place!  Best accessible room I've ever been in.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.  Bed was so comfy, I slept in a couple of mornings.  Room was a little small, but I was by myself, so it didn't matter.",5
1751,"Not my first time in a Kimpton and I can't complain because I booked 2 king rooms at $105 a night!  Crazy deal in the summer in Chicago.  This hotel was in a great location and we walked most everywhere or took cabs which were about $8 plus tip to most locations.   Hotel Pros: Great Location Cool old building updated to modern features Really fun lobby Free wine at 5 (my favorite) Clean rooms Quiet location Great deal Kimpton Points and free internet with my rewards membership Good water pressure in shower Aveda products (don't have to lug shampoo) Free coffee Hotel Cons: Door lock broke and engineer had to come replace it (but gave us a $30 comp) Power blew with hairdryer use (took 30 mins to get power on - building is old) Slow / busy elevators VERY small rooms (but we expected this in the city) THIN walls (you can hear your neighbors) Bar downstairs sucks - tried to use our comp there and the cocktails were HORRIBLE (but they gave us something else b/c we told them so) In the Loop - ideally would have liked to stay river north but this location was worth the price savings Restaurant ACROSS the street from the Cadillac theater is awesome - but closed on Sat and Sun Hotel restaurant was overpriced and not that good for breakfast Would I stay here again?  Probably if I got as good of a deal.  Not necessarily a 4 star hotel though, more like 3  1/2.  I still can't hate on Kimpton though.",4
1752,I must say that I like the style of this boutique hotel!  It is located right in the Loop and has a very different feel to it than other hotels in the area.  In the lobby you'll see red velvet couches and a bunch of other really funky pieces.  The rooms are adorable- the room I saw was pink/brown and was so cute!  The ballroom is also very nice- they have the most gorgeous chandeliers in the ballroom and it would be such a pretty place for a wedding!,4
1753,You cant beat it for the price the quality and the location. I have traveled to chicago a few times and this so far is my favorite little spot. They have wine tastings that make for a good social. The bar is classy and the area of town very safe. I enjoyed my stay and look forward to heading back to chicago.,4
1754,"Just a very nice gesture.  My wife and mentioned we were in Chicago for our 39th wedding anniversary, and when we got back to the room after going out for dinner, there was a bottle of champagne chilling in an ice bucket, plus two very nice champagne glasses and a congratulations note!  Now that's class!",5
1755,"Nice decor, excellent service, but the rooms are so SO tiny.  I mean, c'mon, a closet that is only 7-8 inches deep?  Really?  And the bathroom sink was no better; it only had about 8 inches of depth from the front to the back, making it super hard to hit the target when brushing my teeth.  On the other hand, the quality of the bed, linens, bathroom products, and even the clock radio were all top notch.  For the price, however, I prefer the Hard Rock; it has much bigger rooms and is right next to Millenium Park; it also has free wifi, a big flat screen TV, and even a stereo system and DVD player in each room.  Oh, and the Hard Rock is also about a hundred dollars LESS than the Allegro per night.",3
1756,"Check ins went smoothly. But be advised.... Walls are super thin, the building is old and the rooms are very very very small. The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out. For the price it wasn't bad. It was walking distance to most major attractions. Overall ... it's ok at best. Another plus is the CTA is close by.",2
1757,"I think a 9 year old girl with a fetish for princess stuff designed this and then an early 90s contemporary interior designer finished up.  Way too 'girly' and annoying contemporary style.  I'll give em points for the logo though.  The striped hallways make my head spin sober or not, more so when not.  However, very clean and gives off a swanky feel.  Some sort of theatre group meeting was going on while I was there.  Bonus though of free glasses of wine and socializing around 5pm.  My view was a brick wall and there were odd noises throughout the night so that was a bit of a downer.  The staff is very helpful and actually has a sense of humor.  The best part of the stay... the music they play in the lobby and the elevator.  Granted it's possibly a little too hip and that well may make you sick but good tunes nonetheless.  The Smiths while riding to the lobby, hell yeah.",4
1758,This joint is cute and therefore good for the ladies in your life (of wife in my case).  And you get a free glass of wine which is always a bonus.  The hotel restaurant/bar aint so bad either -- I had the mac n' cheese and fried chicken.  Yikes!,4
1759,"We went to a wedding here recently, and the food and service were great. Later a few us went up and continued the festivities in a rather nice suite, complete with pool table and bar. My only gripe is with the Nazi doormen.. I understand the laws in Chicago about being 15-feet from the door when smoking, and not having an open container on the street, but you're not a cop, and you know there's a wedding going on. Quit taking out your frustration of having a crap-ass job on your guests. Other than that dickhead, the hotel was really nice.",4
1760,"I love this modern, boutique hotel. Right downtown within walking distance of nice restaurants, shopping and downtown business district. If you're in town on business, try to stay here. MUCH better than staying at a typical conference hotel.",4
1761,"I am a frequent guest of Kimpton Hotels and an ""In Touch"" member. I have stayed at the Allegro once before, well over a year ago and prior to the massive renovation. The good: - The location is touristy, but convenient. The El is very close by, as are multiple bars and restaurants. - The renovation is definitely a huge improvement. The palette is pleasing and the rooms are much more restful. - The beds are comfortable, as expected at a Kimpton hotel. The bad: - Leave your toiletries at home, because there is absolutely no space to place them in the bathroom. Literally...zero. - The closets are extremely bizarre. They removed the main rack to hang your clothing and replaced it with two face-out racks...you can't see your clothes all at once, as you are forced to stack them on top of each other. Also, you'll find tacky apparel the hotel is trying to get you to purchase, taking up the majority of hangers. - The doormen (with the exception of one, Fidel) are surly and I found this quite annoying. I was told which cab to get into, as though I'd never hailed a cab before (I am from NYC). While approaching the hotel on several occasions, the doormen would yell at me what door to use (there are three, all of which work...) yet not once did they bother to open it for me. Where is the service? - While check-in was pleasant, the woman who checked me out was both rude and abrupt. Not only was I not asked how my stay was, but I was hastily shoved a receipt (no envelope, no review of charges) and shoved aside for another guest who was checking in...at noon. I travel very frequently for business and pleasure and normally have the Kimpton group on the very top of my hotel list. After this horrible experience, I will likely reconsider my loyalty and may make a beeline back to the Starwood group.",2
1762,"This hotel wasn't exactly what I was expecting based on the reviews I read. First things first...go to the lobby for free wine!  You can't go wrong with that. But, to my dismay, there was no thumping techno...in fact, often there was no music piped in a lot of the time.  When there was music piped in, it was lame pop/rock and it was not the same music as you moved through the elevator/lobby-lounge/bathrooms off the lounge area.  Even though the decor was swanky and AWESOME, the music really sucked the energy out of the spaces for me. Our room was tiny but pretty.  The subway tile in the bathroom is gorgeous and pairs well with the baby blue ceiling.  All the mirrored surfaces entertained me.  It was nice to have two closets; one for him and one for me.  We didn't have bathrobes in our room.  Maybe because it was hot outside? I did sleep well here.  The two Roman shades allowed me to adjust the lighting in the room when morning rolled around.   It was impossible for two people to get any work done with the amount of surface area available, so I wouldn't recommend planning to work from a standard size room here. The location was very convenient to the freeway, but not as convenient to Chicago hotspots.  Things seemed to close early around us. In short, I have mixed feelings about this hotel.  It's chic and boutiquey, but I think I want to try somewhere else next time I'm in Chicago.",3
1763,"A boutique hotel located in the theatre district of Chicago with the usual feelings of one. The hotel is somewhat spotty when it comes to chic and then downright cutting corners, you will notice them. The TV is out of date along with the mini bar and look - feel of the room. It's a quite small room and tiny. That's all i really have to say about this one, try The St. James if you want the boutique experience, or even the Burnham Hotel",3
1764,"I'd go for five stars, but I'm not quite sold on what five stars means to me... Its a hotel with a swanky, distinctive feel.  When I first walked in and saw the wide red staircase, I was convinced I'd gone to the wrong place.  The lobby fooled me into thinking I'd walked into a party room - so much so that I walked back downstairs, got in the elevator and pressed the lobby button, only to arrive back in the same place! My king room on the 14th floor wasn't a room you'd stretch out in, but it was fine by me.  The decor from the rest of the hotel followed me into the room, which was very comfortable and inviting.  The desk chair is great, with plenty of room to work on a laptop and spread things out.  The wide-screen HD television fits into the room nicely and, of course, has a great picture.  The bed sleeps well and the iPod compatible alarm clock is a nice feature. The room layout is funny - I've got two tiny closets, one complete with leopard print tank top and hot pants for purchase.  The bathroom is tiny at a glance, but just fine for your needs.  The vanity is long, so you don't feel cramped when laying out your toiletries.  They are still providing the Aveda products, as other reviewers have mentioned. The free wine hour is still going strong - not $100 bottle stuff, but it's the magic price - FREE.  I didn't try the morning coffee or the room service.  I took a peek in the mini-bar and found what I expect - airplane bottles with big price tags! I couldn't hear the ""L"" from my room, but I faced out over Randolph instead of Wells.  The plumbing noises didn't bother me much either - I think I heard the shower start up one morning out of 4.  The only noise that has been bothersome is that of the neighboring room raising their window shade - like mine, it takes a dozen pulls on a plastic chain that is a bit noisy.  Beautiful shade - poor mechanism. I'd definitely return to this hotel and it makes me curious aobut other Kimpton hotels.  I'd recommend this place to anyone - business or pleasure.  Its right around the corner from the Wells/Washington station on the ""L"" and the Clark/Lake subway station - so a train ride from either airport is very convenient. Oh yeah - for pricing, remember you're staying in the loop.  Nothing comes cheap here.",4
1765,"The Allegro is one of the colorful hotels of the Kimpton chain. The hotel revels in its colorful flourishes throughout the property. The Allegro is a big improvement over its former incarnation as the Bismarck. The rooms are on the small side, but maybe you will forget about this fact with all of the wild colors swirling about you. The curtains, pillowcases, bedspreads are all very bright and may even be shocking to those not used to such unconventional designs. The ""L"" tracks run by the west side of the hotel. The lobby area is very lively, and many flight crews pass through on their way to get some rest.",4
1766,"A total steal.  In February Kimpton offered $44 off best rate rooms to celebrate the man himself, Obama.  Our room totaled $103/night and despite the reviews, I thought it was spacious enough for a weekend with one other person.  The bathroom was tiny yes, and you can hear *everything* going on in there from the bedroom but hey, it happens.   Aveda Rosemary Mint shampoo and conditioner + bath soup and face bar, beautiful and cozy linens and a very attentive staff as I've come to expect from Kimpton!   Great location -- walking distance to Intelligentsia and a few other key spots, and quiet on the higher floors.  I'll definitely be back if there's another deal!   Otherwise, I'm rather anxious to try the other Kimpton spaces in Chicago.",4
1767,"Nice hotel with a boutique feel to it. The daily wine and cheese ""complementary"" happy hour is a great pre-party spot. Only downside is that it's in a business area, so nothing around it stays open late including starbucks.",3
1768,"I would definitely stay here again.  The staff were all very friendly, and it's centrally located - near the el, but chances are you'll walk everywhere.  It's next door to the Ford Cadillac Theatre, and a few other places are nearby - I recommend the Baton Club if you haven't been yet.  Our room was a nice size for the price, the mattress and pillows were new and comfortable.  No oversized tub to hang out in or big fluffy bathrobes - I missed those features.  Good room service food, and be there for the complimentary wine reception in the evenings.  Recently renovated.",4
1769,"My experience here can pretty much be summed up by the following words: Disorganized, kitschy. I work pretty regularly with the Four Seasons Hotel in SF, so truth be told my expectation level is set pretty high for service and ambiance, but honestly people. The decor was... loud. I actually didn't mind the design clusterf*ck nearly as much as my boyfriend did, but I can see why it hurt his feelings: hot pink, gray, and gold couches with copper tables, and gray geometric wall paper? Please. You either have Special Needs or you're as mentally unstable as a serial killer if you picked that out and thought it looked good. And the service. Oooh gurl: Our reservation was through Priceline or some other 3rd party vendor - so even though we called to let them know we were showing up past Midnight and they assured us that they'd keep our room for us, when our flight was delayed and we showed up much later the room was gone. Fine, whatever, we get it - always book through the hotel. But then they promised to move our luggage for us into a bigger room with two beds, and we show up in the new room and of course they didn't move our stuff. So we call them to explain. Someone in our party had the old room key (which still worked, PS) so we grabbed our stuff ourselves cause it was taking too long, and then like three doormen came by the new room, letting us know our stuff wasn't in the old room, and we explained every time to each new person. Just communicate! There were a few other times something similar happened, so all in all everything got done 2-3 times or not at all. The one redeeming quality? Free wine for happy hour.",2
1770,"The Allegro is nice and I had one pleasant stay here in 2005. I truly love the Kimpton chain, but I have found myself not returning to this hotel when I am in Chicago. There are so many places to choose in the loop and near north, and the Allegro really doesn't offer anything you can't find done better and cheaper. It is a nice enough hotel, but the only reason I would return is if they have an incredible deal.",3
1771,"I've stayed at the Allegro several times while traveling for work and have never had anything but a pleasant experience. I typically like modern hotels but this boutique hotel is quite nice. The interesting decor, paired with the friendly staff and great wine happy hour make for a unique experience. I also liked the fact that it's located in the theater district which has its' own feel and is an easy cab ride anywhere you're looking to go.",3
1772,"Based on the other reviews we were expecting a very small room; this was not really the case. There was plenty of room for a desk, chair, king sized bed, minibar, a closet to put all our luggage in and more. The decor in the room and the lounge was fun and contemporary. The room was super clean and the housekeeping did an excellent job. The hotel has a free concierge and a free wine ""social hour.""  They were able to hold our luggage for us all day long after we had checked out, also for free. We will be staying here again next time we go to Chicago. Tips: -Lobby is up one floor from ground level in the lounge. It's tricky to find at first. -Coffee is served in the lobby from the morning to 10am, if you are late risers and come to get coffee at 10:10, it will be gone.",4
1773,"I have never rented a room here, but I have been here about a dozen times for different events - birthdays, political events, and most recently, a luncheon for a newly appointed judge.  No matter what the event, I have been very pleased at the event space at this hotel.  The food has always been good, and even though the place doesn't blow me away, the nice convenience of having it downtown is a plus.  Every event I have attended is in the ballroom on the lobby floor, and although it is not a giant space, it has a great old school charm to it that many of the newer hotels do not have.",3
1774,"Hotel Allegro, you've won us back.  After our lackluster stay last year, the snob offered us a complimentary two-night stay in a king suite.  We obliged. We arrived on Saturday October 10th.  John at the desk was very nice and helpful.  He answered a few questions I had about which streets would be closed with the marathon the next day.  We headed up to our king suite! (I would've given five stars, but I had to take one away for the scary elevator experience.  I heard others on the elevator say that had happened to them before....) Our suite was on the 18th floor.  I'm not a big fan of elevators so being that high was a bit of an ""oh crap"" moment for me.  Anyhow, we jump in the elevator with a bunch of others and head up.  The elevator goes to four.  Then three.  No doors open.  People start to panic.  Then it goes back to four.  Doors open.  I hop right on out.  There is no way I'm getting stuck on an elevator with a bunch of people!  We truck it up the stairs to about the 12th floor and decide to either die on the stairs or try the elevator again.  It's empty.  Thank God. We get to the room.....awesome!!  It has a huge bed, two rooms, two big tvs, a jucuzzi tub, and my favorite....Aveda bath products!!  I changed and we headed back down the scary elevator for the free wine tasting!  Yeah, that's right....freeeeee!!  The white wine was delish!  We had a couple of glasses and headed down to Encore to have an appetizer since we were a few hours early for our dinner reservation.  The artichoke mozzarella dip is awesome!  I loved it.  We had a few drinks, scoped out Dennis Rodman who was also there, and headed out to dinner. We were really impressed with the staff, the room, and enjoyed our stay this time around!  Even the bed-linens are superbly soft.  Me likey.  I'll be back.",4
1775,"i can't attest to the sleeping rooms, but i can as far as meeting planning goes!   we held a corporate meeting for about 350 in their ballroom today, and minus a few AV hiccups (our own fault), it went without a hitch.  their meeting space is nicely updated, affordable and convenient for loop offices via a short walk.   AV and catering sales staff were very responsive, friendly and attentive.  i'll definitely use them again if i can!",4
1776,"My wife and I got married here.  Three words: Worth every penny. I can't say enough about the Hotel Allegro staff.  Kerry, our events coordinator, made it seems like planning a wedding was a walk in the park.  The wait staff had things ready and gave all 150 of our guests the proper food they ordered.  The chef was very accommodating to special requests.  The wife and I, instead of giving crappy candles or other little trinkets to our guests a favors, decided to give them churros and Jarritos.  The kitchen staff had the Jarritos on ice and they made the churros for a marginal price.   My rave review isn't because I'm still high from having an awesome wedding, it's because Hotel Allegro helped us have an awesome wedding.",5
1777,"I received a call from the Hotel Allegro - with profuse apologies and obvious embarrassment . . . it took a while for them to reach me, but Mary, the manager who called, was persistent and very kind.  I feel confident that they have addressed the problems and with that resolved I have no problem recommending this fine boutique hotel!  I will stay there again.",4
1778,"The Hotel Allegro is located right in the midst of Chicago's theatre district - smack next door to the Cadillac Palace Theatre -offering convenience and easy access to downtown culture and the performing arts. Within a short walking distance are the Oriental, Chicago, Schubert, and Goodman Theatres - they had a cute bar attached to it.  I was there right before we saw the Lion King next door and my group enjoyed the drinks and eats.",4
1779,"I've only been in the lounge/bar portion of this hotel, and I enjoyed it.  It is pretty swanky, and they made great martini's for the group I was with.  We stumbled into this place (well, not literally) by accident on our way to find somewhere to meet some friends from the burbs.  It was a little pricey as it's in the middle of all the tourist traps downtown in the theater district.",3
1780,Loved this place! Went for a couple nights with some girls weekends! Enjoyed the comfy rooms with lots of space! Staff is super attentive! Such a fun place and interesting stay!,4
1781,"We arrived at 6am and they had a room ready for us which was great. Its a boutique style hotel with cool decor. Rooms are cute, but a bit small. Its almost like they are trying to hard to make it a really nice hotel. The location is great, right in the theater district and walking distance to Millenium Park. Overall good hotel for the price.",4
1782,Recently stayed on business.  Thought the decor was lovely and the service was truly wonderful.  I would recommend!,4
1783,"This hotel is so freaking CUTE! Art deco lobby with red velour chase lounges and leopard drapes.  Tootsie rolls at the reservation desk.  You can request a goldfish in your room to keep you company!  AND, they have soft, down comforters instead of yucky bedspreads!  A great place overall.",4
1784,"I've never actually stayed here, but I work a block away, had been to some wine receptions, and been to the bar. My general impression with the decor, staff and service, is that for the price they're a step up in color and personality. A convenient location for those who want to do touristy things downtown, but easily hop the train to leave the loop.",4
1785,"Got a great rate here through a discount site and stayed two nights.  Took the train from O'Hare and the hotel was a couple blocks from the stop.  Great central location!  The staff was friendly and check-in was easy.  Our room was clean and big, with modern furniture.  The whole hotel has a fun, hip look to it!  My boyfriend enjoyed tromping around in the funny leopard/zebra bath robes!  Yeah, the bathroom was weird, with the sink in an awkward spot by the toilet and no room for stuff on the sink, but otherwise, no complaints!  They serve coffee in the morning, drinks during the day, and happy hour cocktails.  Wireless internet is free, which seems to be uncommon these days!  Pretty cool!  I'd go back, for sure!",4
1786,"Is it possible to describe a hotel as delicious? I booked this hotel, well knowing I'd be in recovery mood after Lollapalooza. THANK GOODNESS. This place is amazing. I stayed in the King Suite. I feel like a King. Ridiculously spacious. Chic and modern, but not comfortable, tasteful, and cozy. Love the blue color theme and music prints and photographs. Two TVs? Why not. Full bathroom including a tub with jets? Yes, please. The service - from the valet to the front desk - is fantastic. And the small details: the swanky zebra print bathrobes, the fast and free internet, the extensive in-room dining menu. Within 5 minutes of entertaining the room, the decision was made: not gonna bother leaving the room. It's that nice and comfortable. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'd look here in a heartbeat. (I'm so stoked about not leaving room, I forgot to the mention the fantastic location: near anything you need - restaurants, theater, museums, and parks.) *****, no hesitation.",5
1787,Generally very nice - fantastic location however I got some flea bites    ( pet hotel )  and there was a luggage mix-up that almost ruined the whole weekend. And bring earplugs tthe plumbing makes noise,3
1788,"I was pleasantly surprised at this hotel. Very cool updated interior design and fixtures. I'm sure this is an old building but you wouldn't know it by the looks. I was super happy to find I could strut around my room in a cheetah, yes CHEETAH robe while my man wore his zebra robe. These are also available for sale along with a set of cheetah PJs (his and hers) and some cozy socks which were in our closet, just in case. The mini bar is extensively stocked with not only beverage and snacks but also things you may need like toothbrushes, razors and even a ""love kit"", all for purchase if needed. These items were quality brands and eco-friendly in most cases which was nice. The shampoo and lotions were Aveda which also made me happy, they just smell great and have great products. I actually liked their towels, most hotels even some of the better ones have inconsistent and possibly scratchy towels that make you paranoid that you might get stuck with the itchy one. These were consistently plush and didn't reek of bleach. My only negative would be the lack of counter space in the bathroom. The chic table-top sink on a granite counter just doesn't lend enough space for your toiletries but we managed by shuffling the hotels accessories around and using the back of the toilet. I must give kudos to the front desk for upgrading our room to a slightly larger room for free, we booked as a package deal on Orbitz. We tried to purchase an upgrade for the jet tub room but they didn't have any available. Didn't eat there so I can't speak to that, but the area is in the theatre district and close to some good eats. We also had a great corner view room and could see straight down one of the streets (??) and not just at a window of another building which is often your view in a big city. Great hotel, great service, helpful nice people, elevators were fast. I'd go again!",5
1789,The hotel decor it to die for. The staff are helpful and polite. There is a complimentary wine hour nightly. The area outside is quiet on the weekends but its only a 3-4 block walk to the action. I would highly recommend.,5
1790,I like it.,5
1791,"We were at the Hotel Allegro for an Industry Analyst event.  I could not have expected worse. At first glance, you figured it couldn't be too bad as a Kimpton.  The unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent.  However, the rooms just sucked.  Imagine your normal hotel room and 1/3 that size. Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom that's also 1/3 the size.  The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell.  The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college.  The paints peeling on the base boards, the carpet is new, but something is wrong. I would stay at the Marriott, Renaissance, Westin, or any where else.",1
1792,"Ok...so this place isn't for anyone and I hated it when I first walked in.  By the time I left, I'd gotten used to the place and even kind of forgot some of the negatives.  It was an average stay. Room size for several rooms is EXTREMELY small.  I think they tried to do what they could with what they had.  It is, after all, a vintage 1926 building.  I was extremely disappointed with the room size, and, at first, put off by the decor.  My eyes eventually settled and adjusted though.  Also, it seems to make sense with the boutique theme of the hotel. On the positive, the service was good but uneven at times.  ""Superbad"" at the counter was wonderful and even showed my friend and I a bigger room because we had asked to see one.  Other front desk folks were average to below average for a four star place.  I never used the concierge.  The doormen were friendly and helpful.  Location is good.  Readily accessible to the Washington/Wells station on the ""L"".  Also several bus lines run nearby.  You are literally next door to Chicago City Hall and in the same building as the Cadillac Theatre and a few minutes walk from the iconic Chicago Theatre and the Oriental Theatre.  You're about a 10-15 minute walk from the Willis Tower and about two blocks south of the Chicago River.   The free wine is a great amenity nightly, and they bring some nice appetizers over from the 312 Chicago...a restaurant that is co-located in the building.  The food was good (had room service breakfast) and the amenities were enjoyable.   Beds were nice and comfy.  Showers good and powerful.  The housekeeping crew was tremendously nice and helpful.  The place is brand new and clean having just been renovated last year. Negatives?  The wireless internet was a continuous problem.  Two days, it worked fabulously, and two days it just plain was un-usably slow.  I had to go down to the lobby.  The maintenance crew barged in on me after two quick knocks one day.  I get why they did it, but I still don't get the decor for sure.  It's such a mismash of things.  My bathroom in my room was very small.  The sink was very odd, too.  It tended to allow water to swash out everywhere. If you're expecting a run-of-the-mill hotel experience, go to the Holiday Inn.  This is a boutique hotel, and it will not appeal to everyone.  I appreciate what Kimpton is trying to do with this property.  It's definitely a different experience than I've ever had at another hotel.   I might take another shot at the Allegro with another room someday.  Fun and disappointment mixed together for an average stay.",3
1793,"Hotel Allegro is beautiful.  I don't really have anything bad to say about the place.  We had our wedding there in August and it was more than we could ask for.  The staff there was super helpful, so kind and really went out of their way.  KT, the wedding coordinator, made the process so stress free.  She was there for every step and had all the answers.  We had an amazing wedding.  The ballroom is gorgeous, as is the rest of the hotel.  It was definitely the perfect place for us.",5
1794,"Hotel Allegro was recently one of the featured spots on Jetsetter (http://jettsetter.com, a discount travel site featuring high end hotels) and was available for a weekend when I was planning on being in Chicago for a friend's wedding. We got a fantastic rate and I am probably being more forgiving than other travelers may be based on the fantastic deal that we received. The hotel is located in the Loop, Chicago's main business district. As a one time Chicagoan, this location worked great for me, but other people may find that a property off the Magnificant Mile is more ideal. Upon check in, we were given complimentary drink vouchers because we had missed their nightly complimentary wine happy hour in the lobby. Our room had a very retro feel and was clean, but was also very small. Most of the room was occupied by the very comfortable king bed. We had some small issues with both the safe and our AC, but the hotel sent people up very quickly to help with both and they were easily resolved. I would absolutely recommend this hotel, but only to people traveling for business, single travelers,  or those who plan on spending very little time in their rooms.",4
1795,"The company I was interviewing with at the time set up reservations and whatnot, so I cannot really comment on that.  The front desk was very nice and helpful about checking in.  I can't complain about the room.  Everything was comfortable and well decorated.  The view from the 5th floor was a brick wall, but that happens in Chicago.  I suppose my only complaint was the bathroom was pretty cramped, but it definitely wasn't a deal breaker.",4
1796,"Well, I have spent now 3 weeks at this hotel for work.  The bed is pretty comfy, the TV is big, the channels are OK, the rooms are really small!  The staff is quite helpful - ask for extra pillows!  Be sure to try the Encore bar on the first floor, the food is good and tasty - as well with room service.  Location is convenient but know that the Loop goes dead on the weekends.",4
1797,"Very nice and got a great deal. You can't beat $125 (including taxes) for a weekend night in Chicago. The staff was very friendly and accommodating (the outside street attendant let us leave our car parked there for 45 minutes so we could check in and run up to our room without having to pay for parking). The rooms were slightly small, but the hotel is located in a perfect place. We'd definitely stay again.",4
1798,"My husband and I had our wedding here and we are so happy and thrilled we did.   First of all, the entire staff was so nice and accommodating.  We had several room change requests and they always did what they could and gave us the biggest rooms possible.  The hotel itself is very stylish, clean, and hip!   My wedding went so smoothly.  We had the world's best catering sales manager (Alison) who was so patient with me, and I truly consider her a friend now.  Our food was amazing.  We heard so many compliments on the food.  But most importantly, the space is so romantic and breathtaking.  It really is impressive. Please feel free to message me if you are considering having a wedding here.  I would be happy to answer any questions.",5
1799,"This visit was a follow-up to another trip in May 2012. I had some minor issues and hotel management contacted me and invited me to come back. I booked my room via the SPG website. I received an email from the concierge a week or so before my arrival, which was a nice change from last time. I didn't specifically tell them I was coming because I wanted to experience the hotel without thinking that they were treating me special because I complained once. Well, this time they gave me a lot more to complain about (and the issues were much more substantial than last time). It started when I had to wait 2 hours for my room despite requesting an earlier check-in. I totally understand that it's really them doing me a favor based on availability and clearly they were full this weekend. While I was waiting I had my luggage stored and then asked the concierge for help booking the Acura Experience. By the time my room was ready the Acura Experience was already full. I found out there was still some availability at the time I reached out to the concierge (and for about an hour afterward). Clearly she neglected to reach out on my behalf and I missed out. My room was finally ready and I gave the luggage guy my ticket to have it brought to my room. But for the fact that I was standing in line waiting to follow-up with the concierge, he would have given my suitcase to another guest. I saw him bring it to them and I purposely waited to intervene to see how he handled himself. When I finally said it was my bag the guest apologized, even though it wasn't his fault and he had nothing to do with the error. The luggage guy didn't say anything and I brought my bag upstairs myself. I really wanted to settle in quickly so I could get my trip started and start coordinating meeting friends. The employees continually reminded me that check-ins aren't guaranteed until 3:00 PM. I realize that, but it was disappointing especially since they knew about my request at least a week prior to my arrival. There were many other issues that came up and I'll save those specific details for management to address before adding them to a review. This hotel is no longer my first choice when coming to Chicago.",1
1800,"This place has a very fun and fantastical feel to it when you walk in; you definitely feel a little like Alice in Wonderland. When I've had a frumpy day, I like to go here to class up my night :p I've had nothing but good service from the waitresses to the concierge. I work in the Loop so I go to the W for drinks sometimes after. I stayed here with a friend for a ""stay-cation"" a few months ago and I was appalled by the size of the room! I literally think my jaw dropped. The bathroom, on the other hand, was generously sized. Weird. We really just needed a place to crash after drinking but had I been staying here on a real vacation, I would have made reservations elsewhere!",3
1801,OK W seriously...I had two trips back to back...Chicago then LA.  I stayed at the W in chicago and then stayed at the Fairmont in LA.... I'm thinking about exclusively staying at W's I absolutely love the W Everything was great my friend got an upgrade in her room because it was her birthday...the food was amazing...they take the Whatever/Whenever seriously...sure it's pricey...but I'm going to argue at the W you really get what you paid for...,5
1802,"I stay here a lot for work, mainly because it's the closest hotel to my office.  A lot of the rooms are really small and some of the bathroom are REALLY small, but the beds are pretty comfortable.  The service has been good and the room service has some decent options.   The bar is a bit overpriced, but good service and good bartenders.  The lobby is dark and there's always fairly loud music, so depending on what kind of hotel you're looking for this can be good or bad.",3
1803,"I absolutely loved this place, it was actually my first stay at a W, so they took my W card if you will. Bad thing was the front was going on some type of construction, so some scaffolding was there, but that was a minor inconvenience.  The door staff was super nice in getting our bags and doors upon check in and out.  Also, do yourself a favor, talk to Vanessa at the concierge, she helped out A TON on our last day there. The hotel was stylish, clean and I'd stay there again based on their music in the elevators.  Only weird thing was some 3D art that didn't agree w/ my mind after a few shots and beers coming home late.  The Fabulous room was awesome, super clean, spacious and perfect if you need two beds and you've got someone with you.  Plenty of hook-ups for charging devices and all that, kind of bothersome that they didn't have free wi-fi for the rooms, and it was only in the lobby. The bar was cool for a random afternoon drink, but I didn't get to experience breakfast or anything from the local restaurant inside.",5
1804,"I was coming back to Chicago for a quick weekend and thought it would be fun to stay at a hotel since I was bringing a friend from Minneapolis. The W actually was the cheapest hotel in the city that weekend (and still by hotel standards not cheap). I had never stayed at a W, only have heard about its character. The front (desk? Counter? Pod?) person was super nice, as well as the bartenders in the lounge. I thought the room was cute. Yes, small but not the smallest I've been in. My friend, who has stayed at W's in other cities said while this room was nice, it was not as fresh and updated as the one in Mpls or San Francisco. However, I did love the amount of electrical outlets. Many outlets at a hotel are a must these days! If we weren't really there to just sleep I would have probably taken more advantage of the concierge concept. Looked and sounded great! Notes: if you are a new Chicago visitor and want to be walking distance from anything, I would stay a little more east and north. This place is quite alright if you don't mind always hopping in a cab or on the train. There are tons of garages nearby if you don't want to $55 overnight park. I paid I think $12 bucks at one at Franklin and Wells for 12 hours. I'd stay again for sure.",4
1805,"It's a nice looking hotel, but the rooms are small and the bathroom is tiny...The location is great if you're wanting to check out the sites downtown as it's only a short walk or cab ride to quite a few attractions if you're from out of town.  It's a little pricey but what can you expect when you're downtown at the W.   I was disappointed that when we checked in our room wasn't ready and that was after 4pm.  We had to take a walk and eat lunch before the room was ready so almost an hour went by before we could actually go to the room.   Another disappointment was the view.  Lovely rooftop.  =)",2
1806,"This truly is an exceptional W.  It screams all the things that a W should scream: style, innovation, comfort, sexiness and charm.  The lobby itself is ethereal, and even if you're not staying here, drop in and check it out.  The lobby, however, does turn into a cluster. The property must've been full during my stay because there was barely room to move and walking to the elevators required some Gladiator moves. The Fabulous Room is, in fact, fabulous.  Incredibly spacious, comfy, sexy and chic. Really impressive decor and equally impressive functionality: bed, work desk, etc. Staff is helpful, halls are quiet, didn't hear a sound in my room the entire time even though I know they were sold out. Lastly, close to lots of stuff - ideal location in Chicago, in my opinion.  I hope to be able to stay here again.",4
1807,"I have always loved the W hotels, but this one was.. decent but not the most amazing W hotel I have stayed at. The reason I say this is because the rooms are really way to small - at least the Cozy rooms were. The room itself was also slightly old. You can tell from the walls and doors even though the decor in the rooms was modern. The bathroom was also way too small. There really was no space to move at all and this was the same with the spacing between the desk and the bed. It was very difficult to even slide the desk chair out. Another thing that bothered me during the stay was the fact the walls are paper thin. The room next to mine was definitely throwing a party and unfortunately, I could hear the television and the screaming pretty clearly. While the rooms themselves were cramped and older, the overall hotel decor was magnificent. The lobby was beautiful along with the second floor of the hotel - it'd be a great place to throw a party or event. I just wished that the spaciousness of the public areas applied to the guest rooms. The hotel service was pretty good though. I ordered late night room service and even though the kitchen messed up the order, they immediately sent up a different late night entree (on the house) and said that I can order whatever I like for breakfast the next day free of charge. My boyfriend and I definitely took advantage of that one and W Hotel did not say a word about it. Internet was also complimentary during our stay so that was definitely a plus. On another positive note, the location of the hotel couldn't be better so it was definitely very convenient to get around.",3
1808,"Not a fan at all. 1.) Noisy- next to the L. One day there was also amplified music outside at 6AM which woke me up- told management but they did not seem to care 2.) Generally good service (most folks really tried) but had the front desk get snarky with ,me for their screw-up, separately  eff up my reservation, and make me wait about 20 mins to check out on a third occasion.   3.) Ws are great for hipsters- they're not great if you're traveling for business. Little things (like think lights that are actually bright) just aren't there 4.) This part of town is dead after dark, so don't expect to walk to dinner unless you're not picky. 5.) The gym sucks even by hotel gym standards For the price, not worth staying here. Marriott, I think I'm coming back!",2
1809,"This place is unique and great. I was here for 5 days and had I been at a lesser hotel, it would have really worn me out by the end. Instead, the bed was so fantastic that I slept like a baby and didn't really feel the traveling effects that set in after day 2. My only complaint is that the bathroom was tiny. I mean, really, really small. When I sat down on the toilet, I had to rest my arm on the top of the sink because I was so squished. GREAT place",4
1810,Strictly based on the lobby and the bar. OMG freakin' GORGEOUS inside. Love the trendy vibe. Perfect place for causal drinks at the bar after work or before going out!,5
1811,"I love W hotels. This one is definitely not my favorite one. We opted for this one over lakeshore to get two rooms for a bachelorette party in April because I was able to get a better airline industry rate at this one. The rooms are quite small. The girl at the front desk was helpful she was able to get us connecting rooms. However, we had to turn one of our rooms from a one king to a one queen. I didn't even realize such a thing as a one queen bed room existed but ok...the rooms were the exact same size except in the king you didn't really have much walking room. Also note, the king room didn't have a real door on the bathroom but a sliding one that was pretty see through. Can be a bit uncomfortable.... However, my main issue with this hotel was the lobby smelled BAD. It kind of smelled like sewage. They were doing construction across the street which may have caused it but either way it was gross.",3
1812,"This is like a traditional W hotel's attractive, quieter, hard-to-get-to-know sister. The W City Center is still a bit of an enigma to me and I have stayed there several times.  The first time I booked this hotel, I was surprised by its location, but drawn in by the name, I made the reservation and hoped for the best.  Honestly, it is not as bad as some of the SPG hotels that I have stayed in, but it doesn't have the redeeming qualities of the other Ws.   The thing about a typical W hotel is that beyond all of the pretentiousness is excellent service and cleanliness.  This W has the cleanliness, but none of the excellent service.  Most of the service I got boarded on you-are-interrupting-me-checking-into-foursquare-­under-the-table looks and uninformed service on the phones. They usually have better pricing than the other Ws, but you won't get the benefits that come with the extra dollars.  By ""extras"", I mean basic customer service.",3
1813,"From all the hotels I have stayed at (everything from the W to the St. Regis), this particular hotel ranks #1 when it comes to concierge and front desk service. 1. Bill, who works front desk, certainly went above and beyond my expectations. Upon check-in, I made a request for a top floor room with a view of the city. Bill was more than obliged to get accommodate my request. However, when I got into my room, the view was only a building. Ironically, a few minutes later, Bill called and wanted to make sure if the view was to my liking. While the room was very spacious and in the corner of the hotel, I admitted to him that the view was not to my taste. Bill then decided to call me back in a few minutes so he could look over the hotel layout in order to find me the perfect room. A few minutes later, he called back and presented me with a room that could be a hit/ miss. Not only did he come up personally to show me the room, but he also brought up the new keys and offered to carry my bags. This by far is the best ""above and beyond"" experience I have ever encountered. Major props to Bill! 2. Concierge was awesome! Eden was very sincere and helpful when it came to planning my brunch/ sightseeing. She also gave me her business card and hand wrote her name on the card so I could give to the hostess at the cafe, in order to be 1st on the list. Concierge connections such as that definitely brings value to rate! Thank you, Eden! 3. Stephen Bee (manager on duty), thank you! I want to personally thank you for listening to my feedback and recognizing the W-Team. Your follow-up e-mail was also very much appreciated! Thank you once again and kudos to Bill, Eden, and Stephen!",5
1814,"Hmmm...Thoughts: 1) I have never seen smaller hotel room. I have always wondered what my closet would look like with a kingsize bed in it! 2) They asked if I wanted to take part in the magical program (or something like that). That means that you let them NOT clean you room while yo are there and they give you 500 SPG points. Uhm...No! this is a good deal for me how? Clean my room! 3) I kid you not, The bathroom is so small that when you sit down to do your business, you have to lean back all the way so the toilet paper holder can go in front of you. This is the Cirque du Soleil version of going to the bathroom! 4) There is...wait for it...a kaleidoscope in my room on a stand that says ""wish"" umm...I don't get it. 5) On the foot of the bed is a faux fur runner. I cannot even imagine what people have done on that!! ewwww!!",1
1815,"I'm a Starwood bigot, admittedly, but this is one of my least favorite properties.  The rooms--even when upgraded--are small and not that well-appointed.  They always, always, always smell like the cheap MDF that you get at IKEA. The ""Sweat"" gym at this W is a joke:  two lousy bikes, three treadmills, and a few free weights in what might best be described as a room the size of a large janitor's closet.  They don't have a pool--which is fine--but with nearly 400 guest rooms, the gym could be 4x this size and it still might not be sufficiently sized.   Half the rooms in City Center face the obnoxiously loud L, which will ruin your night no matter how many $18 drinks you can stomach. I generally opt for the Westin on Michigan Avenue or the W Lakeshore whenever possible, but sometimes get stuck here due to logistics or availability.  I always cringe, but at least the rooms are clean and I get my Starwood points.",3
1816,"Great decor and really swanky. The ""Living Room"" lounge which also serves as the hotel's lobby is nicely decorated and a great place to grab some good grub. Right in the the middle of everything, you can walk to the El and River and Magnificent Mile. Good luck with finding parking though and I would suggest you just account for having to pay $55 / day for parking - at least you'll be able to come and go as you please. The room I got was contemporary with hip furniture and stuff, but it was super small. eh. Good times none the less.",4
1817,"Probably more like 3.5 stars honestly, but I'll give them a little boost. This was my first stay at a W and I was pretty taken aback when I thought I had accidentally stumbled into some club. The heavy odor of cologne in the air, the obvious mood lighting, and the yuppie crowd with drinks in their hands made me feel like I had just missed the annual Chicago gigolo convention. They play clubbish music most of the time too, which makes me feel like I need to dance everywhere I go rather than just walk. Anyway, the staff is incredibly friendly and gracious, overbearingly so honestly. Everyone kept asking me ""how are you sir? Is everything OKAY??"" Dude, don't be so insecure, I'm cool. The room was fantastic, though I'm not used to inspirational messages on the walls of my hotels. Loved the bath products, though we often didn't have enough. As to why this goes to 3.5 stars ... well like I said the staff was a little overbearing at times. I like good service, but this had an aggressive air about it that made it feel fraudulent somehow. The cleaning staff was not the best. They seemed disorganized most of the time. We opted for the going green option (my lady is a massive point hoarder) but then they cleaned our room anyway, negating the points until we got it cleared by the concierge. Also, the first night we arrived our comforter had several brown stains on it. It looked like a chocolate bar had been rubbed across it ... at least I hope to God it was a chocolate bar ... I need to shower now. The gym was okay, but small and lacking some basic stuff. They have 4 machines: 3 for leg exercises and 1 unwieldy one for ""all those other body parts."" If fitness is important to you, you might want to look elsewhere. And this is just nitpicking, but I'm not a fan of how they have to be hipster with everything. For example, the gym isn't called the gym. It's called ""Sweat."" I got off the elevator and was looking for the sign that said where the gym was. Finally I saw a sign that said ""Sweat (Arrow)."" It's one of those ""collapse your shoulders and tilt your head"" moments as if to say ""Really? Really now?"" Just call it the gym dude, everyone knows hipsters aren't going to be working out. But yes anyway, definitely a different experience for a hotel. Glad I gave it a go and I might just try another W somewhere else.",4
1818,"If given the option, stay at the JW Marriot directly across the street from the W. That is, if you care about the quality of the gym, the room service options and the room. The W gym (I was there just this morning) is a dingy gross room with VERY OLD equipment. 3 treadmills: This morning one was broken completely, one was locked on chinese language and shook violently when operated and one worked. 2 very old ellipticals, 2 old bikes and 1 weird cardio machine that must have been free b/c no one would ever use it. The guy next to me described the place as a ""dungeon"" and we both were just disgusted. The JW Marriot, on the other hand, has a gorgeous and clean workout facility.  The machines are new and the place is just clean. The W is downright dirty. Oh, and the wipey towels were totally dried out so clearly are never used. The room service menu is very limited. The restaurant is weird and expensive. Bottom line: If you can stay at the JW, you should. The W is a dump.",1
1819,"This place is very nice!  I loved my stay here and will use it again if I ever find a need.  Finding the building is not difficult and there is plenty of parking around if you need it.  Or if you're taking the L, there are many stops in the area to catch it.  Checking in was easy and the staff was very nice and courteous.  As I took the elevator up to the room, the walls had a almost trippy 3D effect that was cool.   The room was very trendy and very clean.  The room was fairly small but adequate for only needing to sleep and leave belongings there.  For those who travel for business, this room would work well since there is a desk with any and every kind of connection you would need to work or charge an kind of tech piece.  The linens in the room were white and the decor was well done.  My absolute favorite part of staying here was the bed and pillows.  So soft!  You kind of just sink in to a cloud.  Very comfortable and relaxing.  I want those pillows! The next morning I went down to the lobby to ask the concierge about a breakfast spot I had heard about, and she was very helpful and gave a great recommendation.   Overall I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to any of my friends.",4
1820,"I've stayed at this location twice - this first time was nice, the second time was okay, and that was mainly because of the customer service. The front desk staff seemed like they did not want to be there. Customer service was lackluster. This hotel is very posh, chic - I love the lighting and decor. Its slightly over priced though. Rooms / bathrooms were very clean and nice, the extra towels were a nice touch. On day two, l had to call the front desk to send towels and it took them forever to send them up. I also thought my room was a little small for the price. No free wi-fi. Okay view of the city - very good location to shopping (walking distance or short cab ride). There are so many other hotels to book in the city, and though its a cool spot, I probably will never stay at this hotel again.",3
1821,"I'm using the W's $15 a day internet to tell you that, I have only been at the hotel for 30 minutes, and I already know I will not be returning to any W hotel or recommending this hotel to anyone who comes to Chicago to stay. When I came to the front desk to check in, I told the person at the front desk my name, gave him my drivers license and credit card.  The guy tells me that he can't check me in because my husband made the reservation and ""forgot"" to list me on the reservation (in actuality my husband made the reservation on a third party site that didn't tell him he should list other people staying with him).  I had my 4 month old son with me and he was getting fussy because he was hungry, I had all my luggage with computer and expensive stuff sitting out in the middle of the lobby, and my last name is the same as my husbands last name on my drivers license, and I am wearing an obvious wedding ring.  And this jerk is telling me to go sit in the lobby until I can get ahold of my husband at work during a busy workday because it is ""company policy"".  It made me feel just awful, like why did we bother paying extra money to stay at this fancy-pants hotel if they are going to treat me like I'm trying to break in because I didn't follow their stupid rule exactly right? I get that the W doesn't want people sneaking into their hotel and it's a safety concern... but come on.  How often do people with babies, lots of luggage, and the same last name as someone who has a reservation fake their way into a hotel?  And, what would have been so bad about checking me in, and asking me for my husbands number so he could confirm the reservation?  You gotta give people the benefit of the doubt sometimes!   They upgraded us to a room with a king bed from 2 twin beds, but, really, I don't care if they had upgraded us to a suite with five rooms and a Jacuzzi, or if they have the nicest bar and restaurant in the city, the damage has been done.  You gotta treat your guests right, and this guy did not.  He ruined my stay and made me feel like crap, and I'm never coming back to this hotel again or recommending it to anybody to stay in (and I live in Chicago and recommend hotels to people a lot). In case a manager at the W reads this and wants to know who the front desk jerk was, the dude's name was Steve, he was a tall guy with glasses and brown hair.",1
1822,"I stayed at this W with my girlfriend and we really enjoyed it.  The location was perfect for us.  There was a lot within walking distance, and almost everything was within a short cab ride. The hotel itself was really nice.  We went to the hotel bar a few times, which has a nice, quite atmosphere.  We used their free Acura car service on multiple occasions. Our room was small, and we were right above a train, but the room was very clean and modern. I would definitely stay here again.",4
1823,"I stayed here for 5 days and was thoroughly satisfied with the Doble-Ya. Service was awesome!   Everyone was incredibly friendly and on top of things.  One of the perks of staying here is the Acura Experience complimentary car service which takes you anywhere within 5 miles of the hotel.   Some other perks: Coffee in the morning, hot chocolate in the afternoon, apples in the lobby, Bliss products in the room.   The hotel's location is within walking distance of some historical and popular spots such as the Rookery building, Federal Reserve Bank, and Chicago Board of Trade.  Walk a little further and you can get to the Chicago River, Millenium Park &, my personal favorite, the Art Institute of Chicago.  You'll be singing the theme song to ""Perfect Strangers"" & re-enacting scenes from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" in no time!   I wish they had free wi-fi within the rooms, and free printing services... but I rather have the free car rides anyday.  :) Another thing that I would say is bad about this location is the lack of nightlife when the lights go down in the city.  This is the financial district...  but walk a mile north and you'll be right next to all the best places Chicago has to offer.",5
1824,"We used this hotel for the girls in a wedding party to get dressed.  This place has beautiful architecture and decor which allowed for many great photos of the bride and her bridesmaids.  They were even able to give us a day rate which gave us access to the spacious room for the time frame that we needed.  My only complaint was that staff, possibly a manager, roped off a staircase once she saw that we were taking pictures in the lobby.  Maybe she thought we walked in off the street?  Anyway, we did get plenty of pictures.",4
1825,"Service Service Service, Oh and like all W Hotels its swank as hell. How do you take a 75 year old building and make it this cool. You give it to Starwood Hotels. TK - Our concierge did such an amazing job. Transferred our bags from the Westin Ohare, were we had to stay for one night cause the whole town was booked, having complementary beer in a bucket of ice and snacks when we came back from the trade show, SO NEEDED!!!!. Running down to CVS to get meds for us and all weekend car service. I will never stay anywhere if I can help it.",5
1826,"I've never stayed at a W Hotel before and we decided to on this occasion, because surprisingly enough, it was the cheapest rate. Upon entering the lobby, you do feel like entering a club. You may even miss the small check-in area to your left as your distracted by the seats in the center and all the people lounging around. Service was really friendly and efficient. I was impressed at how nice the girl behind the counter was. When we got to our room, we were so surprised. There was so much room (even in the bathroom!). Coming from NY, you're not used to a lot of room where you can spread out. Our room had plenty of walking room and a one person couch as well as desk. The only thing I wasn't pleased about was that you could hear the train from our room. I'm not sure if every room was like this or if we were just closer, but even at 4:30 AM (when I started drafting this) I've heard the train go by many times. Make sure you bring some ear plugs and maybe that'll help? Location is good and I would definitely stay here or at another W Hotel! We used the complimentary Acura car service they offer and that was pleasant (they offer a one time usage of a car ride within a 5 mile radius). I loved the Bliss products as well!",4
1827,"The hotel has quite the club feel on the first floor. Check in desk is in the back left hand corner and there is really no where to wait. A big mix of concierge desks, elevators and check in staff. I would also have liked to know in advance that they place a $200 hold on your credit card. Made for a surprise when I checked my accounts. Overall, too trendy, not practical, not even sexy. Whoever thought these particular bathroom sinks were cute was right -- but they should also consider function. No way to wash your hands, face or brush your teeth. It was preposterous actually. How you maneuver to accomplish those tasks was beyond me. Really bad water pressure too. The room was clean...but carpet just felt dirty. Please tell me that this building was once something else and re-purposed for a hotel. Otherwise, the layout just does not make sense. Bliss products were the best part.",2
1828,"Ws are a little bit hilarious and a lot awesome. Some of the hilarity is purposeful (the extra roll of toilet paper in the room came in a tidy little bag labeled ""backup plan""), but other things are hilariously unintentional, like the SNL-worthy ribbed black turtlenecks all the lounge staff was wearing. Sometimes I wonder if the W takes itself a little too seriously while trying to be the ""anti-hotel"". While my suite was more than roomy enough and felt clean, spacious, and modern, I did notice that I could hear hall noises so clearly they felt like they were happening in my own room. I didn't hear any neighbor noises (maybe I didn't have neighbors?) but whenever someone was walking down the hall it sounded like my door was just standing open. Fitted black turtlenecks or not, the service was flawless. The W staff came through for me in two major ways. (1) I bought too many pairs of shoes and couldn't fit them into my suitcase, so they sent up a FedEx box and form, and took it away from me once I packed. That was huge! Saved me either extra baggage fees or having to tromp through Chicago crowds to find a post office. (2) My flight got cancelled and I was able to scoot back my checkout time until 1 pm, no questions asked, no additional charges. Speaking of charges, this place is a tad expensive (WiFi was outrageous... don't they know the young, hip crowd likes their internets?), but it was definitely on par with other hotels in the area. When you get to a major downtown location, I notice there isn't much variance in the room prices anyway. I figure you have every other opportunity to stay at a ""normal"" hotel, so stay at a W when you can. It's fun, and the usual gripes can be found at any hotel. At least make it your ""Backup Plan.""",4
1829,"First, I have to admit I love the vibe at W hotels. The changing lighting in the elevators and the house music (this is Chicago, after all!) in the lobby suits me just fine. Last time I stayed, I discovered I forgot my computer mouse. I popped down to the front desk (hidden in the back left of the lobby) and asked where the nearest store was so I could buy a new one. The clerk said, ""Hey, we'll just get you one and bring it to your room!"" Just like that! And, they did, in 5 minutes! I of course returned it when I checked out. It's the small things that really make service stand out for me. I've had room service here and the service and quality were on par with W's all over. I recommend staying here if you need to be downtown, and you ""need"" a place above the average, generic chain. I ""need"" to stay at the W, every time I visit Chicago...",3
1830,"So this is the hotel closest to my Firm's Chicago office, so I've stayed there many times. This past weekend motivated me to Yelp. I was 96 miles short of renewing Gold Medallion status on Delta, so I decided to take my wife to Chicago for her birthday to top it off. The W is right in the heart of the loop, and only a few blocks from my wife's favorite attraction, the Art Institute of Chicago. Also this is where she stayed last time we had a ""couple"" visit, two months before our first child was born, so I knew she liked it. Upon check-in they were extremely courteous (in part due to my Gold Starwood status), and when my wife mentioned it was her birthday, they not only gave us a room upgrade (offering the west side with more ambient sunlight, or the east side facing the courtyard with more quiet; Ed note: the west side faces the El, which is why the ""darker"" courtyard is quieter), but also offered us a selection of wine/cheese/fruit options. She chose champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries. Upon returning from our touristing that day, the chilled champagne and fruit were waiting. I never like to write a review without some constructive notes. First the hotel building is old (although it's been fully modernized), so the outside walls tend to be very cold in the winter. Opening the closet door felt like opening a refrigerator. The should consider more insulation. Also, the water closet is a bit small relative to modern hotels. We will of course return. I haven't even mentioned the trendy, nightclub feel of the lobby.",5
1831,"Honestly, this is really a 3 star hotel.  I gave it the additional star because the concierge gave us a magic card that put us at the top of a VERY long wait list at Yolk for brunch the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Fairly recent renovations, decent check-in staff, Bliss amenities..... We had two ""Superior"" rooms.  Tons of room.  Nice bathrooms.  I typically stay elsewhere when I'm in the city, but it was great for what we were doing. We did drinks and apps at IPO, the restaurant in the hotel.  The service was EXCEPTIONAL.  Everyone was very helpful.  The drinks and apps were great.  I'd definitely try some dinner there next time I'm in town.",4
1832,"Like all of the other W properties, I love the Acura ""driving experience"" chauffeur service (although the times at this property are rather limited). The rooms were spacious, a little bit bare/empty.  There was a pocket sliding door from the room to the bathroom.  If you're visiting as a new couple, keep in mind that the bathroom doesn't provide much ""sound privacy"". I love how they kept the old fashioned mail drop by the elevators. Lobby was very noisy.  Check-in area was rather small. I was there for an event, the 2nd level ""foyer"" has weird ceiling heights, so keep that in mind when planning!",4
1833,"I love these hotels, comfy soft bouncy beds... lol. Very Clean Very Spacious Rooms, Huge Bathrooms... Great service. Every each one is very elegant and they go from old fashioned to modern interiors. Price is always reasonable and it's always in a nice location, always close to best entertainment & dining spots in the city. All my friends stay at ""The W""  when  they come to Chicago. I highly recommend it.",5
1834,"Didn't have a good experience here.  Granted I booked late, and so I paid a very high rate (around $450) and they still put me in this tiny room that makes solitary confinement look comfortable.  They called it a ""Cozy Room"" or something like that.  The front desk attendant offered me some snacks to make up for it, and they never arrived.  I called the front desk to ask and they promised they'd send them up.  Never arrived. I can't tell you how awful the room was.  I couldn't use the restroom as my knees were too long and hit the sink.  I had to leave the bathroom to dry off.  It was not possible to sit at the desk as the bed bumped into the table.  Really awful experience. I'm only giving it a second star because I know the rest of the hotel is much nicer, but be careful what room you get.",2
1835,"Nice hotel.  GREAT location in regards to being able to walk everywhere.  The bar when I was there had some sort of party going on in it, like maybe a birthday party or something and there didn't seem to be any waitresses around to get my drink order but I didn't really care that much because I was simply waiting on a friend to pick me up.  I utilized bag check on my day of checkout and when I went to get my bag the attendant was very prompt.  He was right on it.   The room was very nice and rather large.  Huge bathroom, standard W bed (very comfortable), enormous television.  Seriously, I am not sure that I have ever seen THAT big of a TV in a hotel room before.  LOL   I found the rooms in this while less light filled than the other location to be just as nice and much much larger than the other W hotel. They both have some catching up to do though if I were to compare to either the W Boston or the W Seattle.   I did not try out the restaurant as I was only there one night and arrived late.  Also, there are so many really great restaurants in Chicago that I have yet to try that I, more than likely, will never eat in my hotel's restaurant.  Well, unless I stay at the Burnham sometime.  ;)   I stayed at the other Chicago W location back in December as well.  That one had a much better view but the location for this one in my opinion is better.  This location tends to run better specials too in regards to room rates.",4
1836,"Overall, the W City Center meets, but does not exceed expectations. I stayed here for 5 nights and didn't have one issue with the service or amenities. The hotel does offer Acura complimentary car service which is nice.",3
1837,"I've stayed in a few W's, they've all been very good but the staff at the Chicago W put them over the top. We just 5 days and all interaction with W staff from the front door, check-in and any staff encountered in halls & elevators was wonderful, any requests we made were answered with ""sure, no problem or we'd be happy to"" We were upgraded on arrival and our room was spacious, very well appointed and had a super comfy bed & pillows. The location was perfect for the Marathon, and the hotel really catered to the participants with goodie bags of Gatorade & bananas as well as laying out food & coffee for all in the lobby at 5am the morning of the race. I have to mention the Concierge staff and particularly Vanessa, she was instrumental in making our stay in Chicago a wonderful experience, we really can't say enough about how well we were taken care of. The hotel has a great vibe one of the better W Living Rooms and the location allowed us a few block walk to catch the CTA Blueline to and from ORD. A shout out to @WHotelsofChi we will see you again soon.",5
1838,"Quick Thoughts: - lobby is one of the best W lobby's anywhere if you're into that sort of thing...hotel bar as expected is solid - bed fell short of W standards and sucked compared to the average Westin bed - typical W gym - small, but does the trick (towels in the fridge is a great call) - internet speed in the room was great (based on wireless - they have both wireless and wired) is 1Mb/s down and .26 Mb/s up - billing was annoying given the ridiculous deposit - 40 SPG stays in the past 2 years and this was the 1st time I've had a hassle - staff is great - from room service to check in The W is 4 stars compared to most other hotels, but 3 stars compared to the better hotels I've stayed in the Chitown (Conrad, Blackstone, etc...).",3
1839,"I normally stay at W hotels during my vacations, so I selected this one in Chicago.  I was expecting the normal wherever, whenever service and trendy decorated chic rooms, lobbies and bars.  What I didn't expect was personalized service.  Before my arrival, I was greeted by Laurelin via email inquiring if I needed anything during my stay.  I let her know it was my birthday.  She responded immediately that she would like to offer some complimentary gifts on behalf of the W since I am a platinum member and also asked if I needed help with reservations at restaurants for my birthday  night.  Laurelin went above and beyond the ""wherever whenever"" slogan during my entire stay.  Even though we already had reservations, she called hostesses to reconfirm our reservations for both the restaurant and nightclub to ensure a hassle-free evening.  Additionally, she came to personally greet me after check-in.  Because of her efforts, me and my girlfriends had an amazing time. It was not just Laurelin that provided outstanding service.  We were asking where we could find a 7-11 and the doorman offered to go for us since it was freezing outside!  Another time, we were in a hurry to get food so they helped us get into the Acura car and called ahead to the restaurant to let them know we were coming and needed to be served quickly! At the W you are not paying for a nice hotel, you are paying for the outstanding service.  Laurelin really provided this and ensured that we had a memorable weekend.",5
1840,"My worst W experience ever. 1. Went to check in at 11 pm, no one at the desk had to call the hotel from my cell (while standing at the counter) to get someone to the desk. 2. Didn't have a food menu in my room. Called to get a menu, after a 10 minute delay they called back to say there was no one around to bring me one. The receptionist had to dictate the menu over the phone. 3. WiFi is free in the lobby and $15/day in your room. So if you want to be comfortable and relaxed you have to pay a ridiculous fee. 4. I was woken up by maintenance work on a neighboring room at 8am on my first day. I talked to the manager and he claimed it was work being done by the city (outside). I disagreed because I had a room that wasn't facing the street, but gave up since he offered no compensation what-so-ever and sure enough on day 2 the maintenance guys were working on the room next door at 8am again. 5. The heater in my room was ancient and barely worked. Fortunately, it wasn't all that cold during my stay. I'm not sure if I'll ever trust the W again, but certainly if you're thinking of staying at a W in Chicago make sure it's not this one.",1
1841,"Swank! Swakidy Swank-Swank! Traveled everywhere that month, so no W in the budget!--Had a casting downstairs ;)",3
1842,"I like to stay at W Hotels because I get Starwood points and use them in Europe or NYC. I stayed at the W Chicago for 3 days, and it was only memorable in how painful it was to stay there! Upon checkin, there was a line a mile long in the hotel to the point that the bar was taking drink orders from guests waiting to check in. Not free drinks for our trouble, but we had to pay and still wait! Then, we had made arrangements to receive a very important package at the hotel. When I checked in, they told me it was in security, and when I asked them to retrieve it, it was nowhere to be found. This carried on for 8 hours, until 1am when it finally appeared. Pretty annoying. The customer focus at this hotel is completely lacking. I asked to have the package shipped after we checked out, and I told them, no rush I don't need it sent overnight. I arrive home the next day and lo and behold the FedEx guy is at the door - and I've been charged for overnight service. Ever get the feeling people don't listen! Sorry - hip doesn't cut it.",2
1843,"This place is way overrated.  Actually, for a party in the lobby area the place is fantastic and amazing.  But as far as the rooms... and people..  It seems as though they have some severe service/management/upkeep issues.  Well, except Jessica is great! The rooms are small--not ""hotel in the city"" small, but Times Square Hotel in the City Small.  (The room 10' wide and was no more than 160 square feet).  The bathroom was extremely tiny, as I sat on the toilet my foot had to rest on the metal doorstop.  But that's the least of their problems. The shower didn't drain, and I didn't want to take a bath. So I ended up taking a shower in water that got to be over 6"" deep...   I told the maid (who came and knocked on our door at 9, even though we were only staying one day and had requested a late check out--something a good hotel would make note of and not bother interrupting you over) ... they came and fixed it, but still a hassle. There was no room service menu in our room, just a ""Dining In"" book... But then there was a Room Service button on our phone, so I'm pretty sure they did have regular room service.  We ordered breakfast, it took 45 minutes to get our order, then it came and it wasn't correct.  They serve potatoes but didn't bring ketchup.  They serve toast but didn't bring BUTTER?  How can room service not bring butter for toast?  It was $48 for an omelet/potatoes/toast, 2 scrambled eggs/bacon/potatoes/toast, and one orange juice.  And it wasn't even good, neither of us finished eating even half of it. The room wasn't wide enough to have the TV in front of the bed, it was off to the side and didn't really pull out/rotate so you could watch it head on...   (BTW, someone else on here complained about it, but not having FOX News on their channel lineup is a good thing as far as I'm concerned.... ).  If they really were as hip as they think they are, they could have easily put a flat panel TV on the wall in front of the bed... The lobby space is very architecturally pleasing; the hallways are filled with the wafting smell of gardenia, which I like.... The door man didn't bother to open the door for me as I was walking out, he just stood there watching... (maybe I'm being prissy, but he IS a door man, and he wasn't doing anything at the time, and he was standing right in front of the door). We were told wifi Internet was actually $25/day to use (which includes free calls, too... something I could care less about) not $15... Either way it's overpriced. The rooms were very loud.  Every noise in the hallway, upstairs hotel room, adjacent room, outside cars, el, etc were heard.   Parking is $38 which is high but is probably fairly average for hotel rates, even though garages in the area aren't more than $20/day. I'm never staying here again, and will highly recommend against it to anyone who asks.   And if you do go, avoid room 609... As cute as it sounds, it's just bad news!   I hope not all W Hotels are like this one.  Insanity reigns at the W City Center.",2
1844,"Personally, I am not a fan of the W Hotels.  Personally, they try too hard. They love to deck out their lobbys, put velvet plum pillows on top of beds, adorn their bathrooms with Bliss products, make sure music playing when you get back to your room, and play out all the Hotel Costes chillout-esque music possible in their lounges.  But their service is crap, and you know when the service is crap the hotel's pretty crap also no matter how nice it is.  Which is why it's so ironic they have their infamous ""Whatever. Whenever."" motto.  They don't stand by it.   Anyway, besides that, my stay was nothing special.  Yeah the room's nice but gosh every time you flush the toilet you feel like you're flushing an airplane toilet; talk about high pressure.  Then you wonder if the rooms around you can hear you and you feel bad at the same time if you're going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, which brings me back to the service.  They're so lazy they don't want to bother having plumbers on staff to fix a clogged toilet so they equip each room with the highest pressure toilet they can find.  Genius.",2
1845,"DON'T. EVER. STAY. HERE. OK, I said it.  I arrived at this hotel for business last week.  From the beginning, customer service was terrible.  The guy up front snickered that I didn't have any Starwood points.  I asked if he could help, because all my points are being diverted to Delta.  Sadly, no. My room was tiny, even by Chicago standards, the bathroom so cramped and crowded that my makeup fell into the toilet.  The bed had a glowing light underneath that I couldn't figure out how to turn off.  I had to sleep with the light on. The water got turned off one day into the trip.  Hotel staff offered me a Fuji water to compensate for the fact that my co-worker and I could not flush our toilet, brush our teeth, or take a shower.  Gee, thanks. We arrived back at the hotel at 6pm to find the water still turned off.  Front desk arranged for a transfer to W Lakeshore but was not courteous at all.  The woman I spoke to refused to let me speak to her manager.  We moved to another hotel and I complained to Starwood corporate.  The hotel compensated me some points, but the whole experience was way horrendous.",1
1846,"After a conference in Chicago, I moved to the W to stay the weekend.  It was an o.k. choice.  It's a great location and the aestetics are very typical for a W hotel.   It's located in a historic building and they juxtapose that with modern design.  The lobby and Lobby Bar are nice with lots of  little niches for your group to have cocktails.  They also have the world's largest table lamps!   The rooms are small, but fine for Chicago.  And, the walls are a VERY thin.  I had to call security on our neighbors who were have ""Dance Party USA"" at 2 a.m.  But, the hotel sent someone up to talk to them right away and it stopped. All in all, the customer service and room were very nice.  We did have a problem when we requested movies for our room...a standard service.  They didn't have any of the four we asked for.  If they are going to offer a service, they need to be able to provide it.   I cashed in points to stay here and would stay here again.",3
1847,"I really liked this hotel.  They definitely have consistent theme at the W.  You have to trudge through the nightclubby lobby to check in.  If you're checking in late after a long flight, that can be annoying. I literally thought I was hallucinating in the elevator, but once checked into my room I was pleasantly surprised.  The space was, clean, minimal and comfortable.  While l loved the bathroom, the sink was a design failure.  I spilled a ton of water out of the basin, it was a mess!   The lobby is a great area to hang out and the architecture is stunning.  Loved how they embraced it while keeping the decor funky in  classic W fashion.  I found the service to be very helpful and accommodating as well.",4
1848,"I arrive at the W late on a Sunday night. Even though the lobby is completely empty, terrible 1996 house music is throbbing full blast through the speakers. The girl at the front desk is half-asleep. Looking rather confused, she checks me in. Everything is tan, beige and eggplant like every other W, completely lost somewhere in the late 90's. Internet bubble 1.0. The lift takes me to my floor. More bad techno plays. The hallways are completely dark, in a failed attempt to set the mood. When I find my room, there is a knife and fork on the carpet in front of my room. Light shines through the crack under the door. My card key works in the lock. I enter to discover a completely wrecked room. bare mattress. sheets on floor. mini-bar items strewn about. shower running! I march back downstairs and explain the situation to the same girl, who apologizes and gives me a new room key. Another elevator ride. Still more techno. Another dark hallway. Finally a clean room. Two minutes later the phone rings. They want to offer me a free breakfast for my trouble. That would be very nice, I say. I order breakfast for the morning, request a wake up call and fall asleep. The next morning, no wake-up call, no breakfast, nothing. No thanks W. I'm never coming back.",1
1849,"My cousin had her wedding reception here last summer, and holy crap what a shitstorm it was. For one, the food was cold. Every last bit of food was cold. This includes soup, salmon, and fillet mignon - all of which, last I checked, should be at least above room temperature. At least I was served, though. Some tables on the other side of the room never got food, even though my cousin laid out very specific floor plans as to how many of each type of entree each table received. That's just atrocioius, who ever heard of a big fancy hotel not feeding all of its wedding guests? There are two bars, set up in tremendously inconvenient corners of the ball room, so that in order to grab a jack and coke, you had to squeeze yourself between a few tables and knock into about 15 people on your way. The wedding was a Greek wedding, so the reception followed in kind, with a lot of Greek dancing. One of these dances involves the relatives of the bride and groom throwing money at the new couple. Hotel staff was all too quick to sweep up this money on the floor and pocketed quite a bit of it (according to my cousin, anyway). The hotel is lovely; the lobby is modern and gorgeous, and if I were celebrating an anniversary or something, I'd have no qualms about booking a room here. But I'll be damned if I ever think about throwing a large important event here.",2
1850,"My company had it's Christmas party in the city; so not to drive drunk we got a room here. I believe the mediocre staff gets paid to be aloof.  The house music from 1982 playing in the lobby is a little annoying and what's with the disco ball?  The rooms are small, really small.  The closets are in the bathroom, you have to close the bathroom door to open the closet door.  They DO NOT HAVE FOX NEWS on their cable line-up.  This hotel is for the wannabe, ""Sex and the City"" set.  I prefer to stay at the Peninsula. Whiskey Blue bar is cool.  If you're a fiddy sumthing rich dood looking for arm candy.",1
1851,"W.  Whatever. What happened to the luxury that was the ""W""? I haven't given up on the W brand, but I probably will not be staying at the W Chicago City Center again. Here's why:   1. Rooms are old, small, and run-down. 2. Whiskey Blue was an all-around disappointment 3. Did I mention the rooms? (Not good).",2
1852,"Not a fan of this place.  The staff had a very lazy attitude, terrible customer service, waay overpriced, the room was blah, no special perks.  I asked for an Ipod speaker thingy and they couldn't even come up with that.  I will not be staying here again.  Whack. The lobby is gorgeous, but that has nothing to do with the W, as the building is a turn of the century gem.",1
1853,"This place is really refined & has some great finishing touches. Expect a sleek modern design in the bedrooms but you can forget about open space. The room is like a typical nyc bedroom & I got a view of a parking garage!! Took a 2 hour trip plus 30 minute train ride to feel right at home......But the amenities were better than expected nice flat screen TV, nice layout for the bathroom. What was useful though was the refrigerator, we took out all the expensive water, beer, & chocolates they would have overcharged us for & made it our own getaway fridge. On weekends they have a bar/lounge which provided some entertainment & interesting characters. Location is great though the red, blue, & all those other trains line were right around the corner. Oh & if your famished a McDonald's next door son!!!!",3
1854,"Hmm, I wonder if the management has changed, because most of the negative reviews are fairly recent.  I had my 30th b-day party here last year and the staff was wonderful to work with.  The party went off without a hitch and it was a really memorable experience.  I've also stayed here a number of times and it was great every time....granted, that was a few years ago, so maybe things have changed! They have the cutest plum pillows on all the beds.  They're not plum colored, they actually look like stuffed plums!  I fell in love with them and my husband decided to give me one for Valentine's day.  Only, they weren't for sale in the W store.  So, he got in touch with a concierge who bent over backwards to locate one.  After a month of phone calls to various places, he found my plum!",4
1855,I agree with Claire H.; the lemon drops are yummy here.  We had that and cookies and milk...a roomful of booze in the lounge and we ordered...yup...a plate of chocolate chip cookies and a tall glass of milk to share!  Before going to bed... the rooms are a bit small here...but we loved the rain showerhead... We didn't really pay much attention to the price...I was there for work.  The staff was super nice....,4
1856,"We decided to have our wedding guests stay in a block of rooms here after getting a great rate through our reception site.  The people we worked with to arrange the wedding block were super-organized and quick to respond to any and all questions about the reservations.  They have a great website where you can track who has reserved rooms under your wedding block- this was helpful for reminding out-of-towners to get their butts in gear! My experience at the W, as a bride, was fantastic.  I was given a choice of room- a regular room for free or a suite for the discounted rate my guests had for a normal room.  I went with the suite.  It was AWESOME.  I checked in Thursday afternoon with a ton of stuff and the bellhops were super helpful loading and unloading all my junk.  The first thing I did was order a caesar salad and glass of white wine via room service- both were great (if overpriced) and I loved the little shot glass of gummie bears on the side.  Parking at the W is a total rip-off  but I was able to get a discounted parking pass for myself.  Getting the car from the valet usually took about 20 minutes so I learned to call ahead. I enjoy the club atmosphere on the first level (and in the elevators).  I thought it was really fun.  We had some pre-wedding fun at the bar on Thursday- the drinks are pricey but very good. The day of the wedding went off without a hitch.  My suite was more than big enough for all of us to have our hair and make-up done there.  We got some great photos in the lobby of the hotel.  When my husband and I returned to the suite after the wedding a bottle of champgane was on ice for us with some delicious chocolate truffles and a note thanking us for hosting our wedding guests at the W.  Classy! I did not give 5 stars in this review as the guest rooms were SO SMALL!  Nobody complained about it, as they got a great rate, but they were ridiculously small.  Also, I was charged $4 per bag to hand out our welcome bags.  I thought this was a bit much, especially as I had to call and complain that the people who checked in on Thursday were not given their bags.  Overall though, it was a great experience.",4
1857,"In every way but the service, this is a three-star W.  After staying at the Lakeshore location with its drool-worthy views and conveniently located Bliss spa, the City Center one was just kind of eh.   That said, the staff did everything they could, both before and during my stay, to make sure I was happy.  I e-mailed the manager to ask for a quiet room and request a room upgrade.  Done!  The Spectacular room was definitely a great size for a room in the middle of a big city, and I loved playing with the big squishy plum-shaped pillow. Other pluses: * Fantastic lemon drop in the lobby bar (it was $14, but it came with a pint-size martini shaker full of lemon drop on the side, so it was really more like two $7 martinis) * Super close to the Blue Line El stop (so convenient to O'Hare!) * Better-than-average room service food * Late checkout * iPod sound dock Although I still prefer the Lakeshore for its views and lack of train noise, the City Center was definitely a pleasant surprise based on some of the negative reviews I read here.",4
1858,"Nothing to write home about. Standard W rooms, noisy as hell with the L running right around the building  Your typical service and W lounge/lobby down below. Next time I am in Chicago I am in no hurry to stay here. Oh and guess what if you aren't staying down here for business there is nothing much around",2
1859,"""Whatever, whenever!""  What a lovely motto for a hotel chain! I'm loving my stay here, it's one of the few bright spots of the week.  At first I was incredibly nervous, I had booked this place for a dozen executives and lawyers and I was afraid that it would be a little too funky for them.   The lobby, while very cool, is like walking into a night club.  It didn't make the greatest first impression on the people I needed to impress.  But that was the only speed bump.  From that moment on, the absolute attention to service and detail has been amazing.  Literally, pick up a ""whatever, whenever phone"" and they'll ""grant your wish"" as soon as possible.  The staff at this hotel has made all of our stays wonderful.  They've taken a lot of stress out of my life, and I'm grateful for that. If you're a lawyer coming into the area, the W is also incredibly close to the Federal Court House, which is why I picked the hotel.  We've been able to get back to our hotel, have lunch and a little breather during the short lunches and breaks that we've had throughout the week. Great location and excellent service, hands down. As for the lobby / nightclub.  While my bosses may have thought it was ""too distracting"" I was very happy to stroll through there every evening.  Made me feel like I was taking a short break from all the craziness.  And the waitresses...  (sigh)",5
1860,My experience in this hotel was not very good. If you want a good W in chicago the lakeshore one is better. My room was looking into some other building and the bathroom has a weird setup. Not that great for a W. Lobby is pretty neat though and i love the bar here. Actually to my liking the bar here is better than at the Lakeshore.,2
1861,"First time ever staying at a ""W"" Hotel. The hotel has very different vibe - dark, yet lit here and there with a strange mix of futuristic and hip elements. The front check in desk glows with a pink-ish light as you approach. The elevators have a wild 3D-ish material on the walls. The room was on the 6th floor - and somewhat small - very clean and modern. The desk felt like it belonged on The Jetsons. The bed has a night light system beneath the bed - so it sort of glows. Their was a flat panel HD screen mounted on the wall - BUT no HD channels. The bathroom in my room was tiny. But clean, well maintained, and serviceable. The big fail for the room was the AC unit. It was rather stuffy when I arrived. I turned on the AC and it never really cooled off - it just blew air the entire time. I advised the front desk at check out about the AC unit. The hotel staff were friendly and personable. The evening I arrived the Concierge advised me on eating establishments with walking distance. Beware: If you arrive on a Sunday and need to get to a Drug Store - please note you are in downtown Chicago - all Drug Stores around the hotel are closed. I ended up walking a very long seven or so blocks to a 24 hour Walgreens down off of South Halstead Street. There is a McDonald's next door, a Starbucks across one street, and a Dunkin' Donuts catty corner across the intersection - so you do have alternative breakfast options if you don't want to opt for the rather pricy hotel breakfasts in their restaurant. If it weren't for the AC problem - I'd give the place at least 4 stars. I'd stay here again.",3
1862,"I absolutely love the W City Center. W hotels are known for being uberhip, and this one is no exception: you pretty much feel like you are in a seductive music video as soon as you walk in, thanks to the modern lobby all tricked out in dark tones and low-lit to give the place a perpetual dusky feel. Yes, the rooms are fairly small, but there's a lot of sexy in those little packages. The beds are top-class, with the most perfect bed linens I've yet to experience in a hotel--featherbeds, pillow-top mattresses, down comforters, feather pillows...heaven. The amenities are lovely, as well: in the bathroom, you get a travel kit of Bliss products instead of chain-branded things. Did I mention the floor-to-ceiling mirrors? I'd choose the W to have an affair. Not that I've had one, of course. I'm just saying. The staff during my visit was all helpful and friendly, from check-in to cocktails at the Whiskey bar, and I never felt a thing was lacking. Oh, and free Granny Smith apples are tucked in bowls everywhere, which I love, because those are my favorite.   The whole place is fucking delicious.",5
1863,"I stayed at this W on haloween saturday. First when we got there they put us in the wrong room.we had booked a double and got a single. The single room was ridiculously small. So we called down and they put us in a double, it was much larger and the room was decorated fairly nice. When It was time to shower though, i think they may have given us handicapped room, im not sure, because the shower was kind of just on the floor thhere was a curtain..it would make the whole floor wet and youd get really fricken cold because there wasnt a good place for the heat to build up. We had ordered room service, and the food was really good, but they forgot steak sauce for my steak..i waited, and waited, finally they got it to me but by that time my food was cold. They atleast compd me a free martini to make up for it. Finally when it came time to check out, our bill was just under 800 bucks for 2 people...just because we didnt want to take cabs around on drunk haloween night, and thought it would be nice to stay at a ""posh"" hotel. This hotel would have gotten more stars if it wasnt so expensive, because I can understand and accept mistakes, but for this price I should have gotten much better service, and a much better experience.",2
1864,"Maybe Im just not a W person. I arrived at about 11pm since my flight was delayed, and when I entered the hotel, I thought I must have come through the wrong door, seeing only couches and people sipping trendy martinis. I walked back outside and asked the bellman where the main entrance was, and he informed me that the ""lounge"" in front of me was actually the main lobby, and that the front desk is back in the corner (FACT: if a front desk is back in a corner....its not a front desk!) Anyways, we navigated out way (with our suitcases) through a maze of couches and cosmo-sippers to the ""corner desk"" and finally made it to our room. I guess I'm just an old fart, but I thought it was a little too trendy. Like, why do I need lights eminating from under the bed? And why do I need inspirational phrases on the pillows & walls? Just give me a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom. Bathroom was TINY, and the toilet was wedged between the sink and the wall with very little room to sit comfortably while you do your business. Also, can someone please tell me WHY hotel TVs are so weird? Why cant you just change the channel without having to press the button 5 times? and why does it go back to the stupid hotel channel that nobody watches every time you turn it off & on again? So frustrating! Minus 1 star! I will say that the service we experienced was good, all the staff we encountered from the desk clerks, to the bellmen, etc were very nice and accomodating. Unfortunately, that wasnt enough to save the hotel. I loved Chicago and will return, but not to this hotel.",2
1865,"this review is for happy hour only. I enjoyed the vibe (too cool for school) and the drinks, though expensive (standard downtown $12+ for martinis) were good.  An A for decor and atmosphere.  bar area is small but very hip.",3
1866,"WOW OH WOW OH WOW! Boy do I love the W hotel chain in general, and this hotel did not disappoint.  The hotel has a beautiful modern feel and the rooms are decorated to the nines.  This place is just beautiful, and is especially wonderful for the young, or for those that want to be young.  If you are in your 70s or older, you might understand the whole idea of ""mood lighting"" that is featured in this hotel (as my father did not think this hotel was anywhere near fantastic).   The rooms are actually bigger than I expected.  The way they were architecturally built allow for the most room possible which is nice to see in a big city like Chicago.   If you are staying at this hotel make sure to ask about the free Acura car service that will drop you off 24 hours a day for free within a 5 mile radius of the area.",4
1867,"This is just a review for the bar: Dark, plenty of seating, expensive but decadent cocktails, luxurious setting. This bar makes me want to wear stilettos and fancy jewelry, in a good way.",4
1868,"The W in San Francisco is much nicer than in Chicago.  My biggest concern was the size of the rooms!  I know it's an old building and such but I thought my room was down some narrow hallway and the room itself was rediculously small.  The air conditioner made a loud BANG sound every 10 minutes which isn't good when you are jet lagged as it is. The customer service was quite good as the concierge spent about 20 minutes with me figuring out the best way to get to Northbrook, but that was the highlight of the stay.",2
1869,So I stay here on business and must say for an upscale hotel charging over $300 a night it is pretty crappy. It is very loud at  timess (Some rooms near the L must drive people crazy).  I have had several rooms where the drains work very poorly.  Some thing never work in the hotel (Interent being one of them),1
1870,Agree with Jeremy S.  This could be one of the worst W Hotel I stayed at.  (BTW - Montreal is the BEST!!!) The room is small.  Service was so so.,3
1871,"I stayed here for a business trip and had an average-good experience.  At least it was not the boring cookie cutter hotel I usually have to stay in for these sorts of trips.  I got in pretty early, around 10 am and I was able to check in which was great.  I didn't have much interaction with the staff but the bell hops out front who opened the front doors for me about 30 times in one day when I decided to try to see Chicago in 8 hours in between fielding work requests were great. The room itself was fine and as to be expected from a hotel like this.  Not overly wonderful but certainly comfortable.  The bathroom was pretty small and there were too many doors that you had to open and close.  If you're staying here for a while you might want to make sure you have one of the bigger bathrooms.  There seems to be a lighting problem in this hotel - there were not enough lamps in my room nor did they emit enough light.   I too had the $28 oatmeal and coffee!  Seems to be the breakfast of Yelp champions.  I do agree it was way overpriced, even by room service standards.   I feel bad for the people that work at the front desk here, they have to do everything by candlelight.  They should at least let them have bigger candles.",3
1872,"Wow. Um. I guess a lot of you hate this hotel. Maybe if I paid $300 a night I'd be pissed, but every time I stay here I book my room through Hotwire, and I get some sick deals. The last time I stayed here I got a room for $118. I've always found my rooms to be clean and nice. The service has always been very good, and it's really conveniently located. I know the rooms are a bit small, I can't deny that, but I don't spend much time in the room, so I don't care. I've never had anything but positive things to say about the W in the Loop. I highly recommend it to anyone coming to Chicago for any reason.",5
1873,"I  haven't been to the W Chicago - City Center in a while, so I thought it was time for a visit while in Chicago.  I'm a points whore so doing a ""mattress run"" is a no brainer for me. Hotel is located in the southwest portion of the loop, directly across from the Quincy CTA station. I arrived at 11 AM and noticed the lobby has been renovated.  It's eclectic modern.  Oversized lamps and an s curve sofa make up the main area of the ""living room"".   I walk thru the living room and over to the pods which are located in front of the elevators and I'm greeted warmly by not just one, but two staff members. Since it was so early I was going to ask if my luggage could be stored until check-in time and ill go out and do some other things.  They tell me no problem and as a returning guest they've assigned me a nice suite.  Surprisingly I was told my room was ready.  The property recognizes my Elite status, asks if I need a late checkout and inquires if I need my receipt emailed to me after check out..  Little things like this go a long way.   I go around the corner and enter what I describe as the vertigo elevators of death.  If you look at that mural for too long, you'll be sure to earl. I walk into my room to find I've been upgraded to a room I'd previously been assigned.  The room has been renovation the wall and door that separated the parlor from bedroom have been removed. There is now one central wall that houses a flat screen TV for each ""room"" When you enter the room, there is a powder room on the right and closet on the left.  As soon as you pass thru the entry you're in the parlor portion of the room.  There is a wet bar are and a half wall with a TV above and a desk below.  The desk is nice and very practical but with only a few sockets. The furniture on the parlor side of the room is a bit tacky and its like the hotel was trying to hard to be eclectic.  It's just didn't do anything for me. The sofa is hideous! Passing thru to the bedroom side of the room, the decor is much better, now this what I  think a W should ""look"" like.  The W Bed is totally inviting.  On the wall is 40 HD TV that is identical to the TV in the parlor. Due to the location there is not much of a view, but the room does offer a view of the Quincy CTA Station, which is perfect for train spotters.  I thought being close to the train might cause some noise, but I didnt hear a peep Off the bedroom is a hallway that houses a closet and leads you to the bathroom.  The bathroom is rather awkward. Walking into the bathroom, on the left near the door is the sink and to the right is the toilet and tub/shower. Disappointing that the room doesn't have a double vanity and that there is no separate shower. The sink is pretty small and does not leave much space to spread out. Two people cannot use the sink area at once.  In addition, I got water everywhere.  The room doesn't have a shower only a tub, but it's got some nice hardware and good water pressure.  The bathroom is stocked with the typical Bliss sink side six pack of toiletries. Sweat has nice equipment, cardio machines and free weights, but there is no pool. Some additional information: There is a small business center on the mid mezzanine level. High speed internet available for free in the lobby and its $14.95 in room and the hotel offers Acura service within five miles of the hotel. At checkout on of the associates I'm familiar with said, ""you're one of my favorite guest. You're so funny.  You've got to stay with us for more than just one night the next time you come."" FINAL IMPRESSION If you'd like a good hotel while in Chicago this is the place for you.  Just know that on weekends there isn't much around the hotel, so you'll need to travel outside of the loop for dining and entertainment options. The overall staff attitude has greatly improved.  They appeared to be appreciative of being employed and more than willing to help.   After checkout, I had a small billing issue (this is why I always request that my folio be emailed) where 36 dollars of items from the mini bar was charged to my folio.  When I called about this, it took a minute to remove, the staff apologized and I wasn't made to feel like a liar.  Good recovery and follow-up was good.   I would return to this hotel based on price and time of year, in the winter months i would prefer to be closer to Michigan Avenue. It's a nice hotel for a business or leisure traveler, but better suited for the business traveler based on the location.",5
1874,"The lobby is beautiful. Have you been in there at night (like 3am), when it's almost empty, dark, and the disco balls are lit, so it looks like stars in the sky? It's amazing.   So romantic, and beautiful. The room was so nice, wonderful bed, huge TV, pillows to sink into. I loved it. Free wifi in the lounge, cozy seating areas that make it feel private, free workout gym. I love the gym. Every time we went, there were alway other people there. The machines had TV's and they had headphones for you to use. There was also face wipes, towels, water, and apples. I also love how it is part of NWA/delta's vacation packages and you can use your miles to pay for part of the hotel room. What a great deal!",5
1875,"Stayed at the W City Centre over the marathon weekend, and had mixed feelings. The location was perfect for the marathon as it was close to the start and finish, and it is very close to the theatre district as this was convenient for when I went to ""wicked"". Travellers must note that this hotel is located in the Financial district. On weekends, it's a ghost town around there, not many things like restaurants, cafes or shops are open. I would stay north of the river around the Magnificent Mile, that is where al the ""hubub"" is. Rookie Mistake! As for the actual hotel, the room was tiny (not surprised). If you check into a W dont expect a spacious room. The washroom amenties were top notch, and of course the Bed was Heavenly. The rooms were very chic, but the walls are paper thin, nothing more pleasant than hearing the person in the next room going to the washroom. The concierge staff at the hotel was below average. I always felt like they had no clue. Either that, or they couldn't be bothered to make an effort. The front desk staff were excellent. They were very helpful and friendly. If not for them, I would have downgraded the hotel. The restaurant at the Hotel was disguisting. The food was brutal and the service was even worse. I don't ask for much, but when I say Thank-you please acknowledge me. When I ask for some water, please acknowledge me. When I am ordering from the menu please look at me. The lobby is one of the coolest places. The design and ambience is very funky. It's kind neat checking into a room and having people ordering martini's a few steps away. Whiskey Blue is a fun place to hang out, as well. Overall, I don't think I'd come back. Unless, you need to be close to the financial district.....stay at or near the Mag Mile, and maybe pop in for a cocktail at Whiskey Blue one night.",3
1876,"Stayed here for a weekend using my points and was upgraded to a Fantastic suite, which was pretty spacious. The room and bathroom were clean and had plenty of space and I have only two complaints about the room: 1) The bathroom sink was really small. Everytime I tried to wash my face or something, I would end up splashing water all over myself and the sink. 2) The toilet was situated in THE most awkward space. It was tucked away in the corner of the bathroom and there was literally only 2 inches of space between the front of the toilet and the wall. So bizarre, considering that the room itself had this big open welcome area that was directly adjacent to the bathroom. Other than those relatively minor complaints, I enjoyed my stay very much. The hotel decor is really trendy and modern...and also very dim. It's not the type of hotel I would typically stay at, but it was definitely fun to spend a weekend here. The staff is helpful and pretty friendly for the most part. A good thing to note is that this location isn't particularly close to anything besides the Willis Tower and Millennium Park, meaning if you're in town and want to go out at night, the W Hotel - Lakeshore is a lot closer to a livelier nightlife. There are also not very many restaurants or other things to do around this location, but it is very close to two CTA stops.",4
1877,"A lot of W hotels seem to be old Sheratons remodeled into a W hotel skin.  This W definitely felt like that - especially when you went upstairs with the low ceiling hallways and tiny rooms.  The overall decor, furnishings, and look of the hotel was probably a 3 - it wasn't the most creative W hotel lobby I've seen or rooms I've been in.   My Wonderful room was tinyyyy - if I sat at the desk to do work, I couldn't scoot my chair out all the way without hitting the bed - Anyone larger than me probably would have had trouble getting into the seat to begin with and I'm a 5 foot 2 small asian girl.  The bathroom was also very tiny with a very tiny sink.  It was pretty much impossible to wash my face in the sink without splashing water all over the tiny counter. That being said, for the week that I spent here I definitely started feeling at home and none of the above mattered to me.  The W hotel bed is HEAVENLY.  The room was well appointed and everything was placed in an space efficient way and I had enough room to function comfortably.  Flat screen TV and cable available.  Pretty fast wireless internet (it came free with my room - not sure if it applies to everyone), and I had a radio in my room so I was jammin out to music most of the time I was in the room.  I was having an awesome time in my room. What put the icing on the cake for this hotel was that the service was AMAZING.  Like possibly one of the best staff I've ever encountered at a hotel in my life.  And not the white glove butler type service you get at the Four Seasons where they HAVE to be at your beck and call, but everyone I encountered was sooo genuinely friendly - from the security guard who let me back into my room when I locked myself out of my room with no shoes on at 2 am, the concierge and the front desk, the cleaning ladies actually remembered my name, what room I was in, gave me extra bliss products.  I called down once for a toothbrush and they came instantaneously fast.  The guy who brought me room service was also extremely extremely cheerful and nice.  Every interaction with a staff here literally wowed me and left me with a smile on my face.   Now for some objective notes: Location is awesome.... if you're in Chicago for work.  It's in the heart of the financial district and within walking distance of most large companies as well as near two L train stops.  That being said.... everything in Chicago's financial district (food-wise) shuts down at like 8 pm.. no joke and the streets in general were pretty deserted.  So.. because I work insane hours, room service was my best friend. Room service... argh.. despite their service being so amazing.. as can be expected from a hotel, it takes like 30 to 45 mins for them to bring you food - Comes on time though if you order breakfast.",4
1878,"I am a stick in the mud. Stick in the muds and the W hotel just don't match. It was a nice room, but I hate everything being a la carte. The sink showcased the bold look of Kohler, but was so tiny I could barely wash my face without splashing water on my feet. The elevators had this bizarre 3D sticker thing going on with a black light shining to make things super trippy.  I imagine it must be freaky when you're drunk. Speaking of drunks, this seems to be the place for a lot of clubbers to go out and then come back and spend the night.  We were woken up by a group of drunk guys at 3AM who decided the hallway outside our door was the perfect place to hold a conversation.   An extra star goes to security coming up right away when I called to complain.  At least they don't expect other guests to reason with drunk people.",2
1879,"Quick review of the hotel itself - I first stayed here about 3 years ago.  I dig W's because A) I travel alot and W's have a solid theme.  You can walk into the W Dallas or the W Seattle or the W Lakeshore and you immediately more or less know your way around the hotel.  All of a sudden things become more manageable.  B) W's usually have nice gyms.  C)  W's usually have terrific locations. 3 years ago this one almost turned me off of W's forever.  There but for the saving grace of the Lakeshore W - a truly wonderful, friendly home away from home ... However, I was recently in Chicago when the whole darn city seemed to be sold out.  My only option was the City Center W.  I prepared myself for a sour experience.  To my surprise, they have brought things up a bit.  Looks like they have replaced the carpets, fixed up the bathrooms, and upgraded the A/C units (less rattlerattlerattle AIEEE!).  The staff were friendly and smiling at checkin/out.  Things were much better. Better than the Lakeshore?  Oh my no.  That's still my first choice.  But better than 3 years ago?  Yes.  Give them another 3 years and let's see what happens.",3
1880,This review is for the lobby/bar Very cool atmosphere and great drinks. I thought the staff was friendly and provided good service. There was a nice happy hour crowd there on Friday but after 7:30/8:00 most had cleared out. Bonus: You can bring your dog! Talked to the concierge after seeing a beautiful husky come in for happy hour. Apparently the W is a very pet friendly hotel.,4
1881,"EVERYTHING was fine BESIDES the room size. I stayed in a horriblely small room. I guess it was a standard room, but if I'd known it was very cramped I would of paid for a bit more. The next day I checked out and stayed at the W - Lakeshore and have been extremely happy ever since. The location at W - City Center is a bit better for transportational purposes than Lakeshore, but that's really it.",3
1882,"I enjoyed my stay.  Probably one of the roomier Ws.  I'm definitely a fan of space.  The hotel was centrally located.  I was able to walk to my favorite Italian restaurant, the Village, and the office. The only tip for improvement would be for the concierge to brush up on their restaurants and their restaurant contacts.  They couldn't make a certain restaurant reservation for me and they didn't even know about the Village.  (sigh) For those of you who are interested: http://www.italianvillag….",4
1883,"W's are hit or miss. Some are magical while others are old hotels with loud music and purple lights. This hotel falls somewhere in-between. Nothing about it really stands out. The lobby has your typical w purple club-like feel. The amenities are above average. The surrounding area is dead at night. Perhaps the best thing about the hotel are the rooms. Big, spacious, and the bathrooms have doors (many Ws do not have walls between the bathroom and bedroom). I expect to be blown away by a W hotel and this hotel doesn't. You'll enjoy your stay but you might feel a bit underwhelmed. The W Lakeshore has other issues but it's a much nicer hotel if your heart is set on a W. If you're a Starwood person I'd recommend the Westin North River.",3
1884,"I love ""W"" Hotels.  They always have friendly staff and cool, loungey atmosphere in the lobby.  Two very small examples of why my stay at the ""W"" City Center was memorable.  It was my Birthday weekend and""W""-Insider Jessica Young took the time to send me a little birthday platter of goodies! AND this ""W"" had a particularly AWESOME fruity smell coming from around the elevators.  Two little examples of how the hotel serves and comforts its guest.   I chose, will recommend and will stay at the W City Center again instead the more socially centric W Lakeshore for a number of reasons.  Since it caters to business travellers it tends to have much better weekend rates.  It is also very close to the Sears Tower, Greek Town (I'm Greek so it was important I go see how my people are doing) Millennium Park (The Silver Bean) and Grant Park (The Fountain from Married: with Children).  Plus there is a Loop stop at the corner AND a water taxi stop down a block that will take you to the Navy Pier.  Can't go wrong at the W!",4
1885,"I stayed at the city center in December. First the good, big room nice foyer and a bar that's in close proximity to a very cool casual hangout type entrance. The bad, maybe I expect more from my doorman but seriously does anybody here know how to hail a fucking cab ? I mean it's not rocket science and the jw marriott accross the street had a GANG of employees that knew how. The ugly, what the fuck is that smell in the front lobby ? Seriously, every night when we stumbled back to the place it was something wretched this way comes.... Other than that, maybe I expect too much. Regardless, if you are getting a discounted room how can you not give it 3 stars ?",3
1886,"I love this hotel. Always excellent service, always clean, and always a good scene for young people such as myself. I stay here every time I'm in Chicago. Highly recommend.",4
1887,"I arrived here at about 11 PM on a Sunday night exhausted, grouchy, and a little irritated after a 4 hour flight from San Francisco.  I had a 7 AM meeting and work to finish before I went to bed. The lobby itself was beautiful, low lighting, candles, modern furniture but a little small but still very chic.  A lot cooler than the one in my hometown of SF.  Sorry.  :-(   My room was nice, big king sized bed, flat screen TV, desk, the usual amenities for a nice hotel.   Things I didn't like: - $20 plus breakfast of oatmeal and coffee.  WTF?  Is it organic oatmeal?  Is the coffee hand delivered by Juan Valdez?  I know there is a premium for room service but it's just oatmeal.   - Ugly views, really, my window faced another brick building and was located near the train.   - Pretentious front desk staff.  Do I sense a little snobbiness?  I can tell when you're being rude, and acting catty, I maybe sleepy, tired, but I'm not STUPID!  I would appreciate it if in the future you didn't give me certain looks. You know which one, ""I wish you'd hurry up...""  or ""This smile is fake, but I'm doing it because my manager is watching me.""   A ho hum experience, nothing spectacular.",3
1888,"We stayed at the W the weekend just before Christmas. I went with a bit of trepidation, given that I am not a particular fan of the W on Lex in NYC. A major discount on the regular rate was the motivation to give it a try. When you walk in the front door, you could swear you are walking into a mini versus of the NYC Lex W with Whiskey Blue on the left and a popular after hours lounge the right. However, after spending a few more minutes soaking in the atmosphere you'll notice the vaulted ceiling, tile, and marble accents that give it a warmer, more dignified feel. The elevators will almost knock you over with their 3-d holographic-like walls. Expecting the usual W-esque room, we were amazed to find out they upgraded us to a large junior suite. It looked like the head designer from Pottery Barn just redid the place. Very impressive. What was not impressive is that they want $15 to connect to the net for the day (and no Boingo), though the lobby wireless was free. The staff was especially pleasant. Though it was -30 windchill, the door man stood outside for almost 15 minutes trying to find us a cab. He then convinced the Acura driver to drive us to Midway for no charge. They have a joint promotion with Acura to drive you anywhere within 5 miles for free to show off their cars. We wish we knew this earlier. The only problem is the location if you are going for a weekend. It is only one block from the Quincy L stop, which is nice if you are coming from Midway. But you have to transfer (or jaunt up to Clark and Lake) if you plan to use the trains for anywhere else. It is not a bad walk to State Street to Marshall Fields (ugh....""Macys""....) but a bear to get up to Mag Mile if it is zero like it was the weekend we went. Cabs are the order of the day, but not easy to find in the financial district on the weekend. Very few decent restaurants in the area. Overall, we were happy with our stay, but the location leaves a lot to be desired.",4
1889,"This review is only for the lounge/bar. We randomly decided to come here on a Saturday night. We were hoping to find a nice quiet place where a group of 8 girls could catch up. This was the perfect place for that. The decor was gorgeous and the service was great. It was pretty much empty so we had no problem finding a place for all of us to sit. The drinks were overpriced, but that's expected for the W. I'll definitely keep this place in mind for a cozy night out.",4
1890,"So many ups, so many downs. I've been here a few times for drinks in the lobby and parties in their ballrooms.  I love the space and always have had a good time.  My 30th birthday was held here.  It was good but there were a few glitches.  I was pleased that they let me bring in cupcakes from Sarah's. Most recently, I was in a suite.  The rooms are very nice.  The customer service was outstanding.  I would definitely head back!",4
1891,I came here for a wedding show and while I was waiting in the lobby for my boyfriend to pick me up I noticed that they don't have any plugs for people to use their laptops or to charge up their cell phones in their lounge area. I also have a problem with the fact that their bathrooms were nasty and smelled like a million unwashed &^%$#es and could be better maintained in terms of cleanliness. I am a huge stickler when it comes to nasty stinky bathrooms. It's a nice hotel just needs to be on top of keeping their bathrooms cleaner. I've gone to hotels where the bathrooms are so clean you can walk around barefoot in them. If they just have an area for those who want to charge their cell phones and use their laptops in the lounge area put some plugs in. Overall it's a nice hotel to attend a show or just staying there if you're on vacation or coming for buisness.,3
1892,"I stayed at the W on a recent business trip...nothing but great things to say. Location is perfect if you're in the central loop. The room was clean and cozy! WE, the restaurant in the hotel, is so yummy, with a fabulous wine list to boot! The lounge is great with free wifi to tap in, check emails or go online. All in all a great trip.  I'll certainly be back.",5
1893,"This review is somewhat tempered by the fact that we got a good deal for the place, and the staff and service were mostly fine. I thought the lobby was interesting, although it takes a minute to even find the check in desk which seems apologetically superfluous to its main function, which is to double as an uber-contemporary lounge for the European twenty-something guests. You then enter the elevator under a flood of black light and Euro trance hits bumping through the speakers...at all times of day and night. I felt really sorry for the people's doors that are across from the elevators on each floor. Finally, the rooms are small to medium sized, as if you were in New York and not Chicago. Mattress was not so comfortable. The bathroom and shower were both nice and clean. The snack bar was dumped out over the shelves so the $8 Fiji water and accompanying organic snack bar stared at you in the face the entire time. A loud, clanging sound went off intermittently throughout the night whenever the air conditioning transitioned itself from one setting to another. It's a good thing I only needed to sleep one night of the two I was there. Otherwise it would have been miserable. On the bonus side we did get to interact with a famous and unfriendly hip hop star when our elevator stopped on his floor. So there's that. What I found most odd was that the hotel seems clearly suited for business travelers who need to be near the corporate offices in the area, but I really can't imagine most business travelers enjoying the place based on the above details and others (they had USA Today in the lobby, for example).   Summary: This hotel seems both pretentious and completely misguided for the area. I feel like these sorts of hotels might impress people who don't get to experience big cities very often but it just seemed tacky and dated to me, like a Puff Daddy music video, circa 2002. Not good for business travelers, not good for families with kids, not good for older folks. Good for European 20 somethings and perhaps the odd bachelor party, if they don't mind taking a cab to a part of the city that is alive at night. If not, they could always hang out in the elevator.",2
1894,"This location seems to have the smallest rooms that W has to offer.  Otherwise it is a standard modern and clean W hotel.  The room service was fine,  except for parts of the meal being cold.",3
1895,"I recently spent two nights at the City Center W and had a fine, but not overwhelmingly positive, experience. As other reviewers have mentioned, W hotels try to cultivate a ""club like"" feel. The purple lights and throbbing techno music don't do a whole lot for me, so I'm thankful that they're restricted to the first floor and the elevators. The room my partner and I stayed in was small but adequately furnished with sleek, modern furniture in neutral colors. There was a king sized bed, desk, chair, a few cabinets, and plenty of conveniently placed outlets for cellphone chargers, laptops, etc. Because we were placed in a corner room, the placement of our television was a bit awkward (it's my understanding that most of the rooms have the television positioned on a wall facing the bed, but our bed faced an exterior wall with windows and the television was mounted off to the side -- had we actually been using the television, this might have posed an issue.) The bathroom was adequately stocked with plush towels and Bliss brand toiletries. My only complaint is that the sink was borderline miniature. It seemed like no matter how careful I was when I brushed my teeth or washed my hands, I always ended up having to grab a hand towel and mop some water up off the floor. The hotel is located near stops for both the red and blue L lines, which was perfect for my partner and I. We utilized the L in favor of cabs throughout our stay and were able to get to the majority of our destinations via the red line (which conveniently runs all night.) The staff was friendly and efficient, willing to offer directions and dining recommendations. I used the ""Whatever/Whenever"" service once to request foam pillows instead of down (allergies!) and considering that I called well after midnight, they arrived promptly. My one real complaint (aside from the tiny bathroom sink) is that the in-room wireless is not complimentary. There is complimentary wireless in the lobby area, but the club decor/music in the lobby doesn't exactly facilitate a good working environment. So, if you need to keep up on your work e-mail and are without a smart phone, you'll likely have to shell out for in-room wireless.",3
1896,"The comfiest beds that I can recall.  We were so in love with the bed that we were looking at their in-room catalog for the purchase price.  On an extended July 4th holiday, we would find ourselves in bed until two because we'd just loose track of time.  However, since the W is so centrally located, we found ourself doing all of the following, four days: 1 Wrigley game, 1 US Cellular game, several trips to the Taste, a numerous other touristy stuff, and 1 Nine Inch Nails concert at Tweeter. The rooms had a very modern appeal and the towels were very lush.  The square footage was small, but they made good use of their space to seem bigger. Quick room service.  Love the apples and little nooks in the lobby.  Two bars, one in the lobby and a larger one with a street entrance. Parking on the street is not difficult, especially at night.  But, you could also have them valet it for $39 per evening.",3
1897,"I get the appeal of a trendy boutique hotel, but there are definitely better places to stay downtown and not feel cramped in your room or alienated by the thumping music in the lobby or the staff looking down their nose at you. The bath products are the only ones I've ever sought out after using them in a hotel. Also, this is another place that you pay handomely for a night's stay, and they STILL charge you for internet.  That's like how places used to charge like $2 for long distance calls; It's just tacky.",3
1898,"Rooms here are actually much nicer than the lakeshore location. Rooms seemed larger, BUT you have no views...but you are in the heart of the financial district. So it all depends on what you want. I like the rooms better. I will say SERVICE WAS SLOW EVERYWHERE. RESTARAUNT WAS HORRID SLOW, TOOK 40 MINUTES TO GET SCRAMBLED EGGS AND ANOTHER 10 MINUTES FOR KETCHUP. I think this can be a swank place, good location for theatre etc..but the service here is way below par and please expect to wait for everything here.",3
1899,"I attended their NYE 2009 party and I had a fabulous time.  I really loved the way the hotel looked when you walked in and the fact that its in the middle of the city--a lot different then Naperville!  The decor is very nice and makes you feel good when you walk in.   The rooms were very nicely decorated; however, were kind of small (negative 1 star).  We didn't get a view from our room so that was another downfall.   Also, being NYE, we could totally hear our neighbors until 6 am in the morning partying.   I would def love to come back here for NYE 2010 just because I had so much fun with friends and our neighbors.  BUT, I would not stay here any other time just because the rooms were so small and the walls are thin!",3
1900,"Trendy, well-located hotel with great hospitality. The rooms are spacious but forget the view. Typical hotel bar makes a great meeting spot. We needed to print tickets off for a cubs game - instead of making us go to the business centre the front desk did it for us on the spot for free.",4
1901,"We closed down the bar/lounge last night! Yes, yes we did. I love swanky. My friends had their wedding reception at the W City Center last night and they knew how to throw a parrrtay! We were provided with a full (open) bar, awesome service (the servers were constantly refilling our wine/champagne, swarming us with hors d'oeuvres, etc), luxe accommodations and an amazing setting. The lounge/ballrooms were tastefully trendy. They have complimentary baskets full of green apples. Bathrooms were labeled as ""WC"" and I got instant flashbacks of Italia. I heart Italia. Anyway, the food, service, ambience, EVERYTHING the W provided during, before and following the reception blew me away. Dub, you are fabulous!",4
1902,"We visited Chicago over Memorial Day weekend and stayed at the W City Center.  It has the same feel as other Ws we've been to; hip, stylish and sleek.  The interesting thing is that once you enter the cavernous lobby, you look up and the architecture appears to have a more Victorian, turn-of-the-century feel.  Ornate ceiling moldings and the like, juxtaposed against sleek modern...definitely an eye-catching combination.   The elevators have an interesting sleight-of-eye decoration inside and truly, I wouldn't want to be tripping when riding in one of them.  Just being stone sober inside the elevators could give you a headache if you weren't careful.   Our room was recently updated, according to the deskperson, and definitely smelled of fresh paint when we opened the door,  The paint small clashed a little with the gentle orange scent that otherwise perfumed the air.  The room itself was utilitarian, but TINY.  I'm talking smaller than New York City hotel rooms.  Really.  A great little space, but emphasis on little.  As long as you're not staying in your room much, the space is just fine for sleeping.  The bathroom was updated nicely and was surprisingly spacious compared to the room itself.   Overall a nice place to stay, centrally located and near a Starbucks which is nice for morning coffee.  We'd stay here again!",3
1903,"What's up with the average 3 stars? Guess they weren't in Suite 1209 -1210 After a hell day of travel, miss connection due to Delta errors, cold front and rain... I was soooo elated to check in!! The lobby was extremely inviting with tall white tufted serpentine couches, chess tables, coffee table books, and bar.  We just didn't have time for it.  Our main purpose was to see as many shows at Lollapalooza as possible.   Whatcha get: King size bed Two bathrooms, two plasma screens, comfy couch, streamline sound system that we turned up late night with out a peep from our neighboring guest's complaint. Bliss products Lots of closets Over-sized lamps and a view that was on the sad side (but who cares we were out enjoying the streets of Chi Town) Concierge was  friendly and didn't mind answering questions like: where to buy an cheap umbrella (which we brought at Walgreens -Totes brand did the job fine), how to get to the metro, is it worth taking the architectural tour etc   Maid service fine. All-in-all great clean, peaceful stay and won't hesitate to visit again.",5
1904,"LOVES: -the hotel itself is just majorly cute and has a great vibe -great concierge, Jeff, who will tell you where the hot parties going on that weekend are -car service available for hotel guests -awesome hotel restaurant (WE) for once!! -attention to detail and the overcleaning! notice that the floormats will change in the morning, afternoon, and evening! -everyone loves a W hotel room DISLIKES: -it's in the financial district. you are not in epicenter of things if you stay here! expect to cab it everywhere. -stores and restaurants in the area will close late   All in all, we were pretty happy with our stay but wished that the location was better (like the Courtyard Marriott) although it is super easy to hail a cab anywhere in Chicago!",5
1905,"I absolutely love this hotel. The location is perfect and the ambiance is very sexy. My room was 600 sq feet of luxury. I almost wept when I had to check out. If you stay here, please try the calamari salad at the bar. It is to die for! The staff is very nice and quite helpful.",4
1906,"This review is strictly about ""The Living Room Bar"" in the lobby. Loved it. Maybe it's because we were there early on a Saturday or because it wasn't a busy weekend, but we had the place practically to ourselves. We strolled in just for drinks on a whim while walking home. It's romantic, quiet and has cool decor.   Our server was prompt and attentive at the right times and the drink list is great.  Sure, it's probably $12 or so for the average drink, but it's a lounge-type place where you go to start of the night or to end it. I'd definitely go back if I was wandering by again.",4
1907,"Love it. Loved the lounge area, and that night they had happy hour or cheap drinks, can't remember but it was nice. The rooms and bathrooms were very nice too, a bit small, but decorated very nicely. Bad view from my room, but I didn't mind since I wasn't staying there very long. Location was perfect, so close to Michigan Avenue, Millennium Park, Union Station, and great restaurants. Every time I visit Chicago I want to stay here, but can't always find a good deal. This is definitely one of my favorite hotels to stay at.",5
1908,"The W: Very upscale youth hostel. Thin walls. High concept. Disco ball spinning in the main lobby. Comfy, modern lounge couches all over the lobby. Friendly front-desk staff behind hip-looking glass (or stone) lit from within.  Expensive drinks, and you have to wade through a clot of self-important people to get to the bar, but that wouldn't have been a problem if I'd seen the nicely-tattooed waitress earlier. My room was tiny (my traveling partner said his was huge), but super-stylish and comfortable. Nice TV, DVD player included, space-age design to the desk and all the electronics. Cheesy-yet-fun strip of disco lights under-lighting the bed. Cheesy-yet-fun inspirational saying on the wall instead of a generic abstract painting or seascape. Sadly, the walls are so thin that I could clearly hear the movie my neighbor had going -- though he/she probably had it too loud, it wouldn't have been so bad with real insulation. I'm surprised in the refurb they didn't fix that. It took 2 calls to the front desk to get it quiet enough to sleep. You can't beat the in-the-Loop location -- at least not by much. Overall, I'd stay again if the price is right, which it was on this trip.",4
1909,"I've been to a few get togethers and parties at this hotel, as well as have stayed the night. It is beautiful lobby and great layout. the staff is amazing, probably one of the most professional in the city. Great group of people. The rooms are nice too. Great place for a wedding or reception. Starwood (who own the hotels) have specials from time to time so check their website. otherwise just check out drinks in their lobby (called the Living Room)",4
1910,"The W has an ultra-modern, swanky vibe and is not the kind of hotel I would typically stay in, but it is right around the corner from the site of our wedding (the Rookery building), so we recommended it to all of our out-of-town guests and stayed there ourselves the weekend of the wedding. Overall our experience there was a positive one.  The people I dealt with to reserve our room block were nice, and the suite we stayed in was large and clean.  They also get a bonus star for the tray of chocolate-covered strawberries that we found in our room.",4
1911,"This W Hotel is definitely intended for people staying on business, but we chose to block rooms at this hotel for our wedding which was around the corner at the Rookery. I have to say that the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant to work with. The decorating is almost eerie and Alice in Wonderland-esque. Definitely strange at times (we had one ceramic white roller skate in our suite) but we found it more entertaining that anything else. The food in the lounge was great. They had free coffee all hours of the day, and I ordered a waffle that was delicious. I wouldn't recommend eating or drinking anything out of the room since the prices on snacks are so inflated. Our suite was really nice. We had a separate living room with two couches, a dining room table and a large flat screen TV. There were closets everywhere. Two large full bathrooms which had awesome Bliss Spa toiletries. The bedroom was large with a King size bed, a really cozy down comforter and another flat screen TV. The only negative to the room was that the lighting was very dim (along with the rest of the hotel) so when it came time to do hair and make-up we called concierge for more lamps. And living up to their ""wherever, whenever"" motto, they brought up 4 table lamps in a jiffy! Overall I think this hotel was perfect for our wedding stay. Mainly because it was so close to our venue, but also because it was clean, comfortable, and the staff was very accommodating.",4
1912,"This W staff here is 100x more approachable and friendlier than the W on Lakeshore.  The lounge/lobby is beautiful and inviting.  Concierge very helpful and accessible.  Even though the rooms were small, the bed and shower were very comfortable and made our hotel stay very enjoyable.  The fitness center is very well maintained, they provide water, towels, cold wet towels, apples, headphones, aerobic  machines with tvs on them, free weights, mats to stretch.  I would highly recommend checking it out.  The individual rooms did not have their own coffee pots, but they provide complimentary coffee til 10am every morning in the lobby. Yes the walls are very thin but I've noticed this in most hotels (i.e. The James, and the W on Lakeshore).  I would recommend rooms far from the elevators.  I would have preferred to stay at a more prime location, but its very close to the mag mile and millenium park.",4
1913,"I thought I was going to the W on Lakeshore, I was wrong but was pleasantly surprised.  Spent my birthday nite there with some girlfriends.  All I can say is top-notch customer service.  Walked in and was given the mini-tour of the living room and bar area, nice.  The hotel was very sleek.  I told the front desk it was my birthday and they sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and the best chocolate torte I have ever had. Yummmmm I chose the special rate which includes parking (normally $51 per night) and two free drinks at the bar.  It was well worth it.   They also have a complimentary Acura car service which I took full advantage of.   What better way to spend my birthday day than free champagne and pulling up to the restaurant to meet my friends looking and feeling like a million bucks! Thanks W !",4
1914,"I stayed here for a week while on business. The location is great and the hotel is very clean and accomodating while you are there. There was one incident while I was there, where I came back to my room and saw that the pringles from the mini bar selection had been eaten and the cap put back on. I called down to report the problem and was told that a note would be put on my account. After I checked out and returned home, I reviewed my receipt that was sent via email. 2 cans of $6 pringles were on there that I never ate. I've attempted to call the hotel 3 times, only to be directed to a voicemail that either no one checks or to someone who is too lazy to return calls. I would still stay here again, but I would review my receipt while I'm still in the hotel.",3
1915,"This is a review of the room service and for screwing up my check in / bill. The room service is AWFUL.  Your food will take 90 minutes when they tell you 40.   You ask for fresh veggies and you ask them what they have? They say its seasonal mixed.  Your entree FINALLY shows up 90 minutes later.....and shows up with no veggies.  You call down, and they come back with an entire bowl of brussel sprouts ANOTHER 40 MINUTES later.  I kid you not.  Whole bowl of brussel sprouts?  Aren't they just about everyone's nemesis? Oh and it will set you back like $70 The bill....when I got it, it had someone else's name on it, but my room number, I'm like umm, you didn't check me in as the right person, and so the guy at the desk fixed it, or claimed to, and off I went.  A few weeks later, I'm looking at my credit card statement and there are 2 charges, they charged me for my room plus the other persons room, whom I can only assume was the person I got mixed up with  They fixed it, but why did this have to be so painful?",1
1916,"I have been in two rooms at this location. I wasn't impressed by either of them. I found them to be bland, small and gaudy. I usually like gaudy! The hallways are filled with boring ""art"" or shadowboxes. The lobby is nice, but  I think for  a W it could/should. be done better.  For the price, You should stay at the sofitel.",2
1917,"I definitely prefer having drinks at the W on lakeshore over this W, but I was in a suite here last night and this was a very impressive room. There were at least 25-30 people in this suite and while there wasn't a lot of room to move around it was still spacious.  The trendy room was very elegant and had everything you could possibly need....however, I'm sure you pay plenty for all of it.",4
1918,"For a W hotel, this one falls short.  Room are very small.  Service was great, but it definitely does not have the same W feel as the others I've stayed at.",2
1919,"I spent three months traveling on business and staying at this hotel.  They treated me like family and the service was absolutely amazing.  It was right aruound the corner from my office but had several different options of hotels to stay at.  This was as good as it gets! Throughout my stay, I intereacted was two concierge attendents who on a regular basis did everything to make my stay comfortable - Vanessa L and Laurelin did everything from finding me restaurants, delivery, to even interviewing personal trainers to train me in the hotel gym.  That was only the begininning, they called and followed up with me on a regular basis on how they could help make my extended stay comfortable.  Even a bottle of wine sent to my room, when I had a bad day.  They offered me runs to the store when I was sick or had any other needs.  It doens't get better than this. Jeff, Tree and Israel were amazing with taking care of my luggage and other needs.  I regularly left my luggage at the hotel when I would leave town on the weekends.  To come back and have it back in my room, thanks to this team.   Deborah, was very helpful and kept my room clean on a regular basis.  Justin, the hotel manager, set me up wit a suite for a weekend stay when friends were visiting, including a parlor room. This was an amazing experience and while I may be going back for business travel for work, this is the only hotel I will stay at in Chicago.  Not to mention, it's super swanky and everything seems brand spanking new...",5
1920,"In general, this hotel was a disappointment.  I was expecting much more from a W. The front desk is in an odd location - it requires directions to find.  The decor in the hotel is modern. I checked in around midnight and had booked a room that was supposed to a ""Wonderful Room"" with 253 sq ft.  Instead, they sent me to a room about half that size.  The bathroom was so small that there was no room for the waste basket - which they positioned practically  in front of the toilet.  The vanity was so small that there was definitely no place to put the regular toiletries people bring when they travel.  I assume they think you will be running these back and forth between your luggage and the bathroom. The person checking me in informed me that this was a newly renovated room and it did smell that way.  However, they missed small details such as the air conditioner against the wall was not caulked and the old wall was showing behind it. When I called to let them know I was not satisfied with this accommodation, they offered to upgrade me for another $70/night.  Eventually, I went down to the front desk and the next person on duty was excellent.  He was anxious to make things right and immediately moved me to another room that was twice the size - probably the room I reserved at 253 sq ft. (no additional charge) The lounge was nice.  The service was good and the waitresses were friendly and helpful.  The security personnel were also nice as were the people at the bell desk. The exercise room was reasonable (called the Sweat Room) - but the thermostat was set too high and it was pretty warm in there.  I guess that's why they call it the sweat room:-)   There was a relatively small collection of equipment but it was in good condition and well maintained. Other than the bad first impression, this hotel is okay.  It is nothing exceptional though and for the price, there are better places.",2
1921,"I love these hotels, comfy soft bouncy beds... lol. Very Clean Very Spacious Rooms, Huge Bathrooms... Great service. Every each one is very elegant and they go from old fashioned to modern interiors. Price is always resonable and it's always in a nice location, always close to best entertainment spots in the city. All my friends stay at ""The W""  when  they come to Chicago. I highly recommend it.",5
1922,"This is a great W to get a deal.  I booked a $159 room for Easter night for business, and it came with a free Bliss Spa product.  Pretty cool!  They also had some really yummy hot sangria and little tiny sweet bites by the elevator for guests.  I love that you can get that boutique feeling in a corporate hotel.  This and the W at the lake are some of my favorite W hotels that I've stayed in.",4
1923,"This was my first stay at a W Hotel, and I will definitely stay at one again.  The rooms are fun, fresh and modern, the staff is extremely customer focused and friendly, and they have great lotions/soaps/shampoos etc.  I'm only giving it four stars because this particular W hotel was a bit lacking in some ways.  You could tell they had built into an ancient building and hadn't updated the HVAC system the ac/heat centers in the room were ancient and kind of ugly, the bathroom had this enormous counter and only one tiny sink I would have preferred two or even a larger one, they didn't offer as many amenities here as they do at the LakeSide W which is kind of dissapointing, and lastly I asked for all the down products to be removed from the room since my boyfriend is allergic and the second night there we found out (after lots of watery eyes and sneezing) that the foot pillow they had left in the room was down if you are supposed to be a top calls hotel you have to pay attention tot he details.   however, I will leave you with the positives I saw: Cookies and Fresh OJ in the afternoons in the lobby Lovely bedding/towels, etc I loved the bathroom (besides the sink) They have free water in the gym that you can just go grab at anytime I will definitely stay at a W again if I have the chance/good deal to do so- but if I was going back to Chicago I may look into other hotels, as the downtown area isn't really happening at night and it might be fun to be in a hotel near some night life.",4
1924,"I  went to a conference here the other day with around 400+ people. The break was awesome when they offered unlimited water with your choice of strawberries, cucumbers, or lemon in it. Tons of cookies too. The sound system was great and the room was awesome. I could totally see having some type of reception there.",4
1925,"Great location, comfortable rooms,",4
1926,"Very trendy, cool looking hotel. However when I tried to get information for a wedding and reception for 45 people I was told that my party was too small and perhaps I'd be better elsewhere. Thanks for the suggestion!",1
1927,"The W has converted the former Midland Hotel into a swanky and cool place to be. The outside does not look like much, but the big red W indicates fun is just inside. The rooms and interiors are colorfully and boldly designed, and the new touches combine well with the old.",4
1928,"This not the best W hotel I've stayed at, but it's not bad. I stay here for business trips and it's convenient. I've been warned that the rooms are very small so I've always requested free upgrades as a Gold Member and gotten them. The beds are super comfortable, and I horde the Bliss products because I love them so. The gym also has free Voss water, which is great!",4
1929,"Get an upgrade to a suite. It's worth it. I've had two friends stay in the suites at this property... and they are pretty cool. Again, I am not a fan of the W Chain, but I like this one.",4
1930,"Pretentious, much?  Stayed here with a discounted rate; I would have never paid full price for this snobbery. The W has a reputation for luxury, but I wouldn't consider this hotel luxurious. One of my friends said it best when he commented that staying at this hotel seems to come with the prerequisites of an eating disorder and a cocaine problem. The hotel just tries too darn hard. The lobby is dimly lit and full of mirrors like a 70s nightclub. The rooms are large, very clean, and somewhat well appointed, but definitely not worth the cash. The elevators literally made me want to puke with blacklights and holograms--seriously?! And for all of the ridiculous ""Welcome to the W, what's your wish"" nonsense, the people at the front desk were quite preoccupied by their personal cell phones. Parking's $51. Save yourself some cash and park at that Self Park down the street over night for $34.",2
1931,"There are a few things I know for certain about this hotel, one is that I work here and another is that we are a very small hotel with limited staff and a huge clientele. Personally, I know that we go all out for our guests. If you want a view and a bigger room stay at the W Lake Shore. W City Center is exclusively meant for business trips and short stays. The hotel can get pricey up to $400 a night. If you want to stay at a hotel that will go the extra mile, stay here. Talk to the conierge to find out awesome places to go. We add a lot of bonuses here including a courtesy car, guest gifts and an awesome line of bath products! Try the steak panini on the roomservice menu for a tasty sandwich.",5
1932,"Outstanding service, gorgeous rooms.  Best beds in the world!",5
1933,quite possibly one of the best Ws...  the front desk staff was very accomodating and efficient.  the refurbished rooms are spectacular.  i love that they have lit up the hallways better than they were years ago.  everything was perfect for my stay - and it was sad when it was time to check out. this is the place to stay in chicago.  you wont be disappointed...,5
1934,"love it! artsy, great music, great lounge area, great place for drinks.",5
1935,This is a great hotel! You get upscale without the snobby. The rooms are spacious and the decor in the rooms are classy. The Hotel itself is great and you'll have tons of fun at bar. The prices are a bit high but its a great place to start or end your night. A++,4
1936,"This is not a great W hotel. I stay at many around the country, and here,  the rooms are grimy and small, and the bathroom is barely adequate. not luxury. My flight home was cancelled and I had to stay an extra night in Chicago, so I moved to the Lakeshore - HUGE difference.",2
1937,"Nice hotel, but it is near the track so it is loud and it is loud all night long. I like the vibe in the lounge and the whiskey blue bar. It has a very nightclub like feel.  The drinks are ok the service is awful. I think it was because I didn't have suit on or wasnt dressed properly.  They had good music.  The rooms are nice, bathrooms are much bigger than I would like. I would like to have had more room in for the room itself and less for the bathroom.  I love their bath products by Bliss, they are usually excellent and I enjoyed them. They change the carpets in the elevator so you know what time of day it is. The elevators I think were trying to be very 3d-ish but I think it just got me dizzy and was quite annoying. The workout room was small but they had voss for water.  I have been to the W's in New York and would say its about the same but probably quieter depending on which W you are at.   Trendy, dark boutique hotel.  Decent for the young hipsters and the like",2
1938,"I went to a wedding here - simply beautiful - the setup was beautiful and elegant.  The bride said that she worked with the planner there and they were very attentive to the little details that she wnated.  The food was divine.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.  The bar is a great place to hit up for happy hour in the Loop, too.",4
1939,"Stayed here for business. Convenient location. I was on an upper floor. If you're very sensitive to sound, make sure you request a quiet room or don't be surprised by the frequent rumbling sounds of the Metra. The bed was much softer than I'd thought a Starwood hotel would be. Normal horde of Bliss products. The bathroom was huge.",3
1940,"Definitely not up to par with other Ws, but considering the area, it's not a bad place to stay for business.  The rooms are a little cramped (even the upgraded rooms), but it's clean and the Living Room can be pretty entertaining.",3
1941,"Stayed here between Christmas and New Year's.  Starwood Gold membership gave me a free upgrade, and the much larger room on an upper floor was great - absolutely no complaints. Unfortunately, I had a REALLY ANNOYING experience with the keycards they give you for access to your room.  At first, it worked only after about 10-15 attempts.  Finally, shortly before checking out, it stopped altogether, and of course, I was experiencing nature's call at the time.  Called down to the front desk and waited nearly 20 MINUTES for someone to come up let me into my room.  They're REALLY LUCKY I had not wet my pants. But the Bliss Spa welcome kit was really great (enormous bar of soap that is still enormous after using every day for a month) and the staff very friendly and helpful.  Also, they allowed me early (11 am) check-in and late (4:00 pm) checkout, which was really cool and not always possible at other hotels.  Would definitely stay here again.",4
1942,"This is a nightclub with guest rooms (or a small Vegas hotel without a casino). Once inside, you have no idea what time of day it is. Trance and ambient music flows through the public areas and the glowing light is minimal. At first it's cool but then it gets depressing. The staff is friendly and the amenities are useful but you pay quite the price for it.",2
1943,"I stayed here a few nights while working on a project.  In fairness to this hotel property - I suppose it was true to itself, but it just wasn't me.  I just couldn't get comfortable.  If you like clean line architecture, modern decor and darkness with smatterings of artificial light - this place might feel like home for you.  However, it wasn't just this that I didn't like so much  - it was number of things, one being the uselessness of the room set-up.  The rooms were clinically beautiful, but the Plasma TV was at such an angle that when you pulled it out to watch from bed, the remote sensor was covered by the molding, rendering the remote useless.   Also, I went to retrieve ice from one of the ice-rooms and my key wouldn't work, so I called down to the staff and they stated that every floor's ice room had that issue (they offered to promptly bring me ice).  But I just couldn't help but wonder - every ice room on each floor wasn't functioning?  Really?  I also didn't like the fact that there wasn't a terrace or any place I could ""go-outside"" and maybe read a little bit.  The property was very constricted and cold.     This isn't about the staff - honestly - they were insanely helpful and courteous.  I just don't get the purpose/model of the hotel.  It reminded me of going to a pretentious French fusion restaurant where the entrees are big on pretty and small on taste.  A little confused I guess.  I've been to other W's and they were very nice.  This may be an anomaly, but I think I'll check out the other hotels in the area.",2
1944,"Supposedly special weekend that I had written to the hotel about before arriving.  This hotel failed in so many ways I hope that others will think before booking here.  Service - non-existent.  4 of us at the lounge for over 2 hours - nobody ever came to see if we needed anything until we were getting ready to leave.  Concierge?  Non-existent at the hotel - had to go 4 times before somebody was there for us to ask for a breakfast recommendation (instead - I Yelped and was EXTREMELY pleased).  One person at the desk so wait time to check in was long and tedious.  All in all - I would not go back here especially since there are nicer and better hotels in the Chicago area.  This hotel seems very worn down and in need of an update too.  Finally, I don't need to have self-help sayings plastered all over the place!",1
1945,"FuFu is not always hip. Employees: The employees try to be so cool, they seem distant. Not much personality here.   Cleanliness: The hotel is clean, but looks too dark inside. Facility: The room we stayed in was just plain strange. It was long and narrow. The hot water for the tiny sink in the Bathroom, along with the shower was not consistent. The sink water never got warm enough and the shower water took forever to get warm. You can't watch the flat panel TV from any place in the room. You can't see it from the bed, even though they have it mounted on a swivel base up on the wall, it doesn't swivel enough. Not even close. There is no couch. You only get a fufu chair that is one of those long chairs and it's REALLY uncomfortable. As you walk into the room, there is only one tiny light in the ceiling. This makes the entire front part of the room too dark to be useful. The one saving grace for the room was the bed. It was great, along with the bath towels. The desk in the room (908) has broken leg tips. Those silly looking words printed inside the lamp shade and also in the wine shelf were just plain spooky. It made using those lights a no-go. There was a nice ice machine on this floor. The slide light controller for the lamp was lame. The elevators have sort of 3D images on each side of little round objects. It's not good to place 3D in transportation devices that go up and down. This makes some guests dizzy. You have to navigate through a narrow corridor in the Lobby because they have places for people to sit and drink as you attempt to leave the hotel. Overall Recommendation: This hotel is located near, well, nothing. A better choice would be the Intercontinental located on the Magnificent Mile. It has gobs of restaurants and movie theaters within walking distance.",2
1946,"I'm surprised this place has gotten some poor reviews. My group and I came for a convention and checked in with relative ease. The staff was courteous. Granted, the check in was in a corner but I felt like this hotel in its entirety had a unique modern feel to it. (There was complimentary drinks at the checkin although non-alcoholic) The rooms themselves were not all set up the same although had same features. The bathroom was modern, not spectacular, but definitely nice. I LOVED the large flatscreen that was in every room. Just imagine modern beds, desks, bathrooms, ect. Hell you can even buy half the stuff in their catalog. On my visit there was a plate of cheese and stuff. (it had a card with a different name on it but hey, we were hungry) The concierge is amazing. Needed some mouthwash. They stated they didn't have any. Guy came up. Gave him a dollar. Went to shower. Came out and saw a bottle of mouthwash sitting there with the $4.95 sticker still on it. This guy went to buy mouthwash that cost more than what I gave him! We got there late, wanted to buy some beer but was told the liquor store was closed. They sent up 2 complimentary coronas. Service was amazing. Room service was good. ( i was kinda buzzed tho so that may have thrown my palate off a bit) Concierge was top notch. Had a bill dispute hence the 4 stars. (bottle of wine was charged to our room although there wasn't a bottle there when we had arrived.) I would definitely stay again. Even just to ride in their elevators with the 3d thing that trips you out.",4
1947,"This place is interesting. Lobby and decor are modern, as other reviews will tell you. I hate the cologne in the elevators... Rooms are OK, but nothing to write home about. It's an old building refurb, and there is only so much you can do... Service is phenomenal, which, along with central location, is what moves this from a 3 to 4 star review.",4
1948,"W = Will not be staying here again. The room was TINY - the bed was super hard (Fred Flinstone's bed people), there was track lighting on the floor - which was difficult to turn off.  And the best part?  Our heat was broken - and our room was 90 degrees by the time we woke up in the morning.  I couldn't wait to leave. We got our room comped because of an event my boyfriend was attending - so thank god, we didn't pay for this.     This is my first experience with the W chain and I must say that I am not eager to try this chain out again.  Too bad that the City Center spoiled this supposedly fabulous hotel line for us.   There are plenty of hotels in Chicago - and you can do a lot better somewhere else.",2
1949,"The location of this W is great- it's downtown, so very accessible to Loop areas. The rooms are very nice, with white cabinets/shelves in the room and plenty of space. The big issue I have with this property is the layout of the lobby area.  There's not a lot of space, and the path to the check-in desk and elevators is not very intuitive. Note: I am on a personal mission to stay at every W Hotel in the USA (and then hopefully branch out to worldwide!)",4
1950,"Beautiful rooms, pretty good crab cakes!",5
1951,"We stayed here during a recent trip to Chicago.  The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Chicago's ""Loop"" and is central to just about everything.  Service was very prompt and courteous during our 5 night stay.  We even got one night free for staying over four nights which was nice considering the room was over $500/night.  The Lobby bar (more like a swanky nightclub/lounge) was very impressive - with vast soaring ceilings, comfortable ultra modern furniture and a live DJ.  Images were being projected all over the walls as we enjoyed top notch drink service.  The restaurant in the Hotel is small but perfect for lunch or an intimate dinner.  The 24/room service catered to us well during the entire stay.  I still can't get over the $9 bottles of water and the lack of free WIFI  - but the room was spacious and the beds were UNBELIEVABLY comfortable.  No real views in the entire hotel (we were on the top floor) because the building is surrounded by taller highrises.  Very few complaints - The ""Acura Experience"" where you make a call to Concierge and have a new Acura SUV as an included car service to escort you around the city at any time was VERY nice!!  Didn't have to take cabs very often.  Overall I would recommend this hotel to those looking to stay in the center of everything.  It is a fun place, and I can't say enough about the gracious staff or exceptional atmosphere!",4
1952,"DON'T HAVE YOUR WEDDING HERE!!!!!  I had mine at the W City Center and although it is a beautiful place, I can't imagine how they could have screwed up more.  This is even considering I had my own private wedding planner.  I don't want to know what would have happened if they did the event on their own.  I'll make this short  and only include a couple screw ups.... 1. They screwed up my PARENTS' room....yes my parents'...the ones actually paying for this 300 person event!  They were supposed to have a suite with a King Sized bed and they had a room with a double.  They kept giving them the wrong keys to the room for about and hour and with all of this hassle made them late to rehearsal dinner. 2.  They threw out the top of our cake!!!!!  Who does that!?  That's a common tradition to save that for your first anniversary.  They apologized and said they would make us a new one for our anniversary.  So, a year later I got in touch with the catering department to coordinate our new cake.  She said ""no problem"" etc.....then the woman didn't return my phone calls/emails the week before my anniversary and we AGAIN didn't have a cake! This was absolutely NOT what I anticipated from one of the nicest and most expensive hotels in the city that could have held my wedding!",1
1953,"I only stayed a night  but it was a lovely hotel.  The staff was very nice and prompt.  It's very swanky and the decor is very hip.  Overnight parking is what you'd expect in Chicago. I felt like I was in a nightclub in the elevator, I guess they really cater to a young crowd.  The concierge however gave us incorrect information about reservations at a restaurant so that was annoying but I'd still come back.",4
1954,"This was the cleanest hotel I have ever been in. The service was also fantastic. Every person I encountered was wonderful from the doormen, to the wait staff, to the cleaning personnel. The service and friendliness made my weekend getaway fantastic!",5
1955,"I stayed at the W City Center for a girls weekend.  The lobby is fabulous and sexy, but somewhat disorienting because it is soooo dark and then you sign your bill at a glowing desk - it caused a bit of stumbling around (and that was before drinks at WE).  The rooms were a bit of a disappointment - incredibly small, with little room for much else besides sleeping.  The appointments were standard, good, but nothing above average.  The mini bar was really overpriced.  The bathroom was of good size with a great shower and the Bliss bath products were the one ""extra"" of the room and greatly appreciated. We had dinner and drinks at ristorante we and the food was yummy but uninspired.  A real after-work crowd on week nights. Overall, I would recommend the W City Center if you aren't planning on spending much time in your room, or if you are by yourself.  Hanging out in the lobby and at ristorante we is a must, but that's something you can do without renting a shoebox of a room.",2
1956,"wi-fi sucks, and the front desk will promise to bring up a new cord to plug into the high speed internet directly, but they never deliver, and won't answer the phone. lame wi-fi and mediocre customer service? i think the W can do better than that. :o(",2
1957,no water until 8:30 on a Friday?   then only decaff the next morning?  f'real how does a hotel run out of coffee?,1
1958,"If you like staying at a hotel that feels like a night club this is for you.  Lobby had the music and light show going on and then it carries into the dark elevator with 3D effect walls that'll disorient you or keep you entertained till you reach your floor.  Room was clean, modern, WHITE, and WHITE.  Used the Acura experience a couple times, that was a nice perk.  As far as overall service, it was great.",3
1959,"Kind of crazy.  This place is super swank in the lobby. Sort of West Elmy with a plum velvet twist. Light projections, art, velvet furniture, black lobby. 2 door guys, 1 concierge, 2 desk people, 1 very tall blonde and removed store clerk. Some very cute, kitschy and extremely specific items in the hotel shoppe. The hotel's restaurants and bars swing right off the lobby behind tall black walls. Initial impression was grande. The stay. The stay was super plush with a cushy king, proper amount of pillows for 2 plus a nice body pillow xtra. Toiletries included Bliss travel pack (found at Sephora for $25 a pop). Very nice. CS/Modern Luxury and Wired magazine in the room, nice details. Overall, the stay was comfy and friendly. We stayed in the Fabulous room. Service. Service was ok. It didn't seem to be very coordinated. I was supposed to have champagne and strawberries delivered for my birthday morning. Didn't happen and we got tired of waiting. They tried to reschedule for the evening and that really wasn't as seamless as you'd think, either. The first night of our stay, we requested extra hangers. We had to ask repeatedly and then we finally got them. Like a DOZEN of them, on our last day. Thanks. The Whiskey Blue was a nice hangout and you can't really beat the location as far as being able to walk to many of the touristy attractions and CTA. The hotel did seem to be a magnet for underage teens which was kind of odd to me. For some reason, I don't really notice teens in VA unless it's in Tysons Corner, where they persist in droves. In Chicago, it seems like it is teen CENTRAL!",2
1960,"The W hotel is located right in the middle of the Chicago city.  It is near all the famous locations.  Its walking distance to Navy Pier, the Water Tower shopping mall, and the Buckingham Fountain.  The W hotelhas to be the best hotel in Chicago.  Just from the exterior you can see how amazing it is.  The hotel shines at night in blue lights.",5
1961,very nice!,4
1962,Sweeeet hotel! Attended the NYE festival & had an awesome time. Will definetly be back next year. Room was very nice as well.,4
1963,"Stayed here on the, ""Come and Play"" promo rate of $139 per night which included 2 nights of parking and 2 free cocktails.  Great deal.  I have stayed at SO many W hotels...I used to prefer this one over Lake Shore but I'm starting to re-think that.  The rooms at Lake Shore are bigger.  We stayed in room #1715 which was a Wonderful room with a king-size bed.  I was shocked at how thin the walls were--I heard the baby crying in the room next to me.  UGH.  I've never had this problem during prior stays.  Front desk staff is very accommodating.  Kudos to the maid for replenishing our Bliss toiletries every day with new ones (even if we still had full ones).  I found the bartender in the Living Room bar to be completely bitchy.  I ordered a glass of wine and Shirley Temple for my niece and it was as if I had asked her to drive to Evanston to get the ice to put in the Shirley Temple.  Rarely do I forego tips but she didn't get a tip from me because of her attitude.",3
1964,"A friend of mine and her family stayed here while they were attending a wedding a couple blocks away. They asked me to meet them to watch their little boy. They were promised a pool. I found it odd that this particular one had a pool but it was promised. There is no pool.  OK, small oversight.  As I got settled in, I ordered room service for myself and their child. After being put on hold for 5 minutes, I asked for a chicken sandwich (seriously, this was the cheapest thing on the menu and it was $14) and a peanut butter sandwich for the little guy. I specified 3 times to not put jelly on this sandwich.   I also ordered a glass of milk and a diet pepsi. The bill total was $44.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  I know that hotels way overcharge for room service but you can get some decent food...this was crap.  The sandwich was way over seasoned and mushy and the fries were stuck together and, again, way over seasoned.  The peanut butter sandwich came WITH JELLY on hard bread.  It did not get eaten. Now on to the pros... great rooms, great lobby, hip and very cool interior, comfy pillows, Bliss products, huge bathroom and cool decor in the rooms.  Oh and HUGE tv. Overall, if you're in town on business, this place is super convenient... if you're in town on pleasure, stay at the W on Lake Shore Drive. It's larger and much better.  Oh, and no matter what, leave the hotel and check out some of Chicago's excellent restaurants. Don't eat here under ANY circumstances.",3
1965,"As everyone knows, the W is known for it's contemporary, chic decor and of course, the Bliss Spa.  W City Center needs a little help, though.  It's decor lives up to W's reputation, but the rooms are very small and the bathrooms feel more like the Holiday Inn.  The Bliss producst are fabulous, but  I was very disappointed in the hotel overall.  It needs a lot of updating, architectually.  The hallways are narrow, the walls are thin, and the rooms are small and stuffy.  I had trouble sleeping as the airconditioner never really cooled the room off (despite the thermostate being turned down to 66).  The restuarant is fabulous and they did let me check in 4 hours early, so I will give them that.  Overall, the W hotels in Chicago (including the Lakeshore) are disappointing.",3
1966,"one word describes the w city center, ""issues"". not grandma drives me crazy issues, but i forgot to take my meds and dont know why this gun is in my hand issues. stayed at one their nicer rooms on the 20th floor for my girlfriend's birthday, so it wasn't a broom closet like the other reviews mentioned. on first glance it is a very nice room with widescreen lcd tv, california king bed with a stuffed plum, and a large bathroom. it all gets lost when you notice the details. the toilet was large to match the room size, but so big my girlfriends feet didnt touch the floor when sitting on it. the shower was very tall with bliss products, but the shower curtain looked like someone ran out to target and got one that wasn't long enough. there was only one robe and a few hangers for two people. i called the service desk  or ""style manager"" as they call them every day for four days before we finally got the extra robe and hangers. they were supposed to have a birthday surprise in the morning of my girlfriend's birthday. it never happened, i called the concierge and noone answered. i could stall no longer so we had to go down to the concierge and see what happened. they apologised saying that noone noticed it in the ""system"". with the surprise no longer there, they offered to have whatever my girlfriend wanted waiting for her later. they got it wrong and delivered at the wrong time so we ran into them setting it up, but it was there.. went to the lobby the next morning to see the real problem. rich high school kids decked in d&g trying to impress their white trash girlfriends. by making the W's patented whatever/whenever service do their ridiculous requests like fill the bathtub with m&m's, the rest of the guests received whatever they wanted whenever they could get around to it if possible. we left and i forgot a vanity bag on the batroom shelf. i call the ""style manager"" who was not available and left a message that was never returned. on the positive, the bed was extremely comfortable with great sheets so we slept well and bliss products were a nice way to wake up. the whiskey blue bartender was friendly and poured drinks so strong you were thankful that you only had to stumble to the elevator. i would have been floored if this was a super 8, but this is a 'W'...",2
1967,Hotel was awesome. Very clean. Pool was great. Lots of rules but that's what makes is so clean. Health club and sauna so clean. There is so much to do at this hotel. Pizza in lobby restaurant is so tasty. Front desk manger Gerald was so helpful. Barnard helped us with all our needs in the lounge on the 17 floor. Make sure you get a room that you have the privilege to use the longe it has a great breakfast and a great cocktail reception. Oh I forgot to mention Sarah in marketing who help me with all my reservations. Thanks again Radison... I will be back Forsure Mercedes,5
1968,"The hotel is beautiful with many subtle Chicago touches. I stood in a wedding here last weekend and it was just ok. While checking in at the front desk I was not sure what name the room was booked under but the gentleman apparently doubted if I was even at the right hotel. I believe he was joking but his insinuation was not appreciated. We stayed three nights and the first day our room was not cleaned. I called the front desk with two questions and no one picked up. The message I left was never returned. The suite we got ready for the wedding in did not have a dvd player or anything for us to hook a computer up to the tv with. When I did encounter staff they were nice but overall the experience was underwhelming. The wedding party had a wonderful weekend but the bottom line is for the market the hotel is trying to market itself in (close to $400 a night rooms, $15 dollar drinks) the service and small touches were simply not on par with the rates. We easily could have had an equally good time somewhere else.",2
1969,"Stayed here over Labor Day weekend. Loved it here, clean, gorgeous, convenient location close to everything in a safe part of town. I went jogging down the street and by the marina, which was absolutely beautiful. You can walk to most everything or take a short cab ride. The bar and restaurant are also excellent; the food was delicious. My room had very clean, simple and modern lines (7th floor). My family rented one of the condos on the 44th floor with a wrap-around balcony, the views were absolutely amazing. The door men were exceedingly helpful and friendly! I especially loved the outdoor pool, track, and garden area. My only disappointments were that this area closed to guests -- you couldn't even walk around! And the hot tub was not as hot as I would like, and a little too small. Although there was free WIFI I did not always get a good signal. But other than that, fantastic! I would definitely stay there again! :)",4
1970,"What an amazingly beautiful hotel. We went here for Lollapalooza and I have to say I was surprised at how quiet it still was with all us crazy people there. The location is perfect! It only took us less than 10 minutes to get to Grant Park walking. You've got Michigan Ave less than 5 minutes away. O'Hare is about a $40 cab ride away. Not too bad. There are 2 pools which are both lap pools, but not too many people doing laps. 2 hot tubs that were nice and heated to the right temperature. The rooms are very modern and beautiful. Don't get the side with the fire house. I'm a deep sleeper so I never heard it, but the bf complained a lot about the sirens. I wish the balconies had furniture, but I get why they don't. I love that you could schedule your room clean up through the tv. Amazing! I would definitely return on my next trip to Chicago. Loved how friendly and helpful everyone was. Oh almost forgot one of the elevators broke on one of the days and in a few hours it was already fixed. I was quite surprised. Great hotel!",4
1971,"My parents were planning on going to Chicago for my father's 81st birthday and their 43rd wedding anniversary. When I asked where they were planning on staying, they replied 'Red Roof Inn'. Noooooooo! I quickly called Blu Aqua Hotel and booked a 2-night stay (my treat!) for them. Blu Aqua was awesome! They first looked to see if there were any specials they had for seniors. They didn't at the time, so they offered a breakfast and balcony room package deal. Blu Aqua upgraded my parents room to a corner room (much bigger) with wrap around balcony. They had beautiful chocolates waiting in their room (a birthday and anniversary gift from hotel). They also allowed my parents a super late check out. While in Chicago, my Dad got his wallet snatched (not anywhere near the hotel). The Concierge totally helped Dad cancel his cards by looking online for phone numbers, etc. This would have taken a huge amount of time (and a lot of stress) for my non-tech savvy parents to do this on their own. I totally appreciate how Blu Aqu took care of my parents (especially after the wallet snatching - and helped make such an enjoyable trip). My parents are older (Mom - 72, Dad - 81). It's nice to know someone (Blu Aqu) is looking out for them - when I'm thousands of miles away. THANK YOU, Blu Aqu!!!!",5
1972,Such a beautiful lobby and the rooms are bright and fun. The staff was very nice and helpful as well. Plan to host many of our filmmakers here for Chicago Comedy Film Festival as well and look forward to giving them the very best of Chicago!,5
1973,"As a retired Hotel General Manager and owner of 2 hotels I want to express my appreciation of the service and quality of the hotel and food operation as excellent. The total staff from the front door to the bellman, front desk staff, and food service peronnel was one of the best hotels I've stayed at. I have traveled plenty and must say for a young operation I give them a 10. The room cleanliness as the entire hotel is spotless. Go see for yourself how great this hotel is. I'm going back. F.

1974,A beautiful hotel with a great view!,5
1975,"I totally love the funky, chic feel of this hotel!  Stayed here with a group for a wedding and could not have been more pleased.  Agree with the below review about the total awesomeness of the funky theme throughout the hotel's furnishings.  When I opened the door, the combo of the black sparkly floor with the metallic closet doors created a disco-ey feel, kind of like the room was welcoming you into a party.  This, combined with the funky blue blue plush carpet was enough to set me back a few years.  The best part of the room?  Definitely the bed.  I have never slept so well.   I found the hotel to be super quiet, and also surprisingly, with an excellent desk for me to get some work done during the day.  I loved the ease of having a nice restaurant downstairs that wasn't too pricey, yet still nice enough to enjoy a good drink and some apps while relaxing from the day's events.   The proximity to Millennium Park is also unbeatable!  Location is always key (particularly in a city that has such scary driving), and the Blu did not let down in this respect.   I also found all the employees to be extremely accommodating.  Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I would definitely be back!",5
1976,"This is snazzy hotel in a great location. You're close to Millennium Park and Michigan Ave (where all the shops are). We had a room on the 13th floor with a great view of the park and buildings. The room itself is spacious and lovely. The king size bed was very comfy. The bathroom was spacious as well. The shower was nice with a shower head atop and then a shower massage. The facility itself has a nice fitness area and both outdoor and indoor pool.  They're both lap pools and there's a hot tub as well.  We didn't get to enjoy the outdoor pool as much as the weather was on and off rain. There's a sauna, a basketball court, and a game room with pool tables. We ordered room service one night and it was good, nothing out of the ordinary.  There is one complaint - one day maid service took awhile and we had to call twice.  That was a bit annoying as they didn't come into our room until after 4PM! Also, beware even if you touch a drink in the mini bar refrigerator they'll charge you! All in all though, a great place and I'd stay again.",4
1977,"We reserved a block of rooms for our wedding here. We did have some initial issues with reserving the block, but it was during the first week that the hotel opened, so I am willing to chalk that up to growing pains. Once we got there, everything went very smoothly and we received top-notch service. There are plenty of common areas, indoors and out, to gather groups in. The fitness center is fantastic. The location is prime. The restaurant/bar is tasty. The price is average for the area, but the decor and facilities are brand new. We also took a lot of our wedding photos in and around the hotel and they are beautiful! I absolutely love the aesthetic of this place!",5
1978,"I really enjoyed this hotel!!-- It looks very new. The rooms were well designed and it is very modern. It was a splendid stay. The fitness center was very modern and well designed. It would have been nice to have towels supplied -- but, this is minor. Great facility -- really enjoyed  my stay",5
1979,"I was here for a wedding over the weekend and could not be more impressed. The lobby is stunning, the hotel has free internet (which is rare for nice hotels), the pool is to die for and the food I got from room service was great and timely - even at all hours of the night. The event space where the wedding took place was stunning and the rate we got for the group, $190, is pretty much unheard of in the area. I would definitely stay here again for special occasions.",5
1980,Just stayed at this hotel on a business trip while in Chicago.  Excellent Hotel!!  Extremely well designed and decorated with impeccable service.  The amenities were really nice including pool and work out room.  The restaurant and bar was really nice and great food. Location is really nice and easy access to all the downtown Chicago hot spots.,5
1981,"I experienced the best service and attention to detail in a hotel that I have seen in a long time.  I was impressed with the service, the cleanliness and the cool factor.  I look forward to staying here again in a few weeks.",5
1982,"This place is snazzy and jazzy. One of my favorite hotels I've stayed at. The Radisson Blu Aqua is this pillar of awesomeness that is truly splendid both outside and in. They kept the wave theme throughout. The halls/room were decorated in an offbeat sort of way that I liked, with this blaring aqua colored carpet and then half the place had these little sparkly mica bits embedded in the floor, so it was like a disco ball in the entryway. The not so good: it was very quiet until Saturday night, when there was a huge party and the people next door were ordering room service at 2am. The doors on the rooms slam inadvertently. And when they were out on the balcony I could hear them speaking even though they were not speaking loudly. In the morning, a tourist ferryboat comes by on the river with a megaphone and it sounded like he was right in my ear. And I was on the 10th floor. But if you don't sleep in this wouldn't be an issue. The noise things did not dim my appreciation of the experience much. p.s. if you are staying here while going to a conference at the Sheraton (less than 10min walk), be aware that the most direct route across the river involves 3 flights of stairs down to a lower road level. There is another bridge that doesn't involve stairs but it would add 5-10 mins to the walk.",5
1983,"I got a reservation for this hotel through a groupon purchase, and it was definitely worth it. The hotel itself has an amazing location, great views, and I love that you can go outside on a balcony (a rare treat in the city). The room was beautiful- extremely modern looking, but still comfortable and completely spotless. The staff was very friendly- both at check in and at the Filini Lounge where we had a couple drinks late at night. I was impressed by the overall appearance and the staff. If the hotel was more affordable I would definitely come back... might just have to wait for a special occasion or another groupon!",5
1984,"Very good service and really nice rooms! Stayed in a Park Suite and loved all the amenities. Really, really nice workout facility. Great business lounge... Not sure what else to say. Probably my favorite hotel I've visited.",5
1985,"One of my favorite hotels in Chicago....and we have stayed at a variety of hotels in downtown!! Staying 1 night at the Aqua made us want to move to the building permanently....if only ....*sigh* Location is great, it's close to/lovely walking distance to River North and the Mag Mile, yet you're separated from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Although our view was directly of another building, we could still see Navy Pier and the Lake. Morning swim in the indoor pool and dip in a jacuzzi is the perfect way to start a Saturday or Sunday morning!!! The lobby is GORGEOUS!! I couldn't get enough of it! Intricate gold chain designs over mirrored walls with brick column type structures and delicate flowers atop low tables...haven't seen anything like it in Chi yet. The room felt very fresh and clean, loved the modern design of the bathroom...felt very European. Great service. Delicious food and drinks at Fellini. Can't wait to come back.... another Groupon perhaps? :)",5
1986,"I just spent several days at the RBA for a conference and have mixed feelings about the space. Aesthetically, it's gorgeous. The beds are ridiculously comfortable, the shower is GIANT (some rooms have up-to-your-neck deep soaking tubs), the public spaces are inviting and comfortable. But, as an event planner, when I'm paying this much money for a room/event space, I expect some pretty high end functioning. We had several mix ups with our staff rooms and guest rooms (the hotel checking people out too soon or cancelling reservations even when we specifically stated the reservation needed to be changed, not cancelled), the shower handle in my bath broke, as did the knob that gave functionality to the handheld shower head. A member shut her glass shower door only to have it shatter (thankfully it's covered by a film that held the glass in place). And the room had a ridiculous espresso machine that didn't work properly. As far as the event space...again, aethetitically, it's great but it's not set up well for functionality. Screens are too small in meeting rooms, sound system is not created to work on an individual room basis so stand speakers that blocked the screen views were set up, and the registration area is a bar that has little functionality for the needs of registering several hundred people. As a plus, the service staff were extremely friendly and on top of things as soon as they needed to be done...which was a big plus, but not quite enough to make up for the other elements. Hopefully they'll work out the kinks before I get back there next year for our 2013 conference.",3
1987,"Absolutely beautiful hotel-- probably the nicest I've ever stayed in. I live in Chicago, but my friend and I went there for a ladies get away in the loop, and it was a fantastic time. The lobby and rooms are impeccably decorated:  warm and inviting yet still sleek, modern and colorful.  The sparkly marble floors in the room are a stand out.  The shower and bath area is beautiful, and the rain showerhead is incredibly relaxing and upscale from most hotels I've stayed in.  The beds are super comfortable and warm.  Our room had a balcony, which was fantastic, even thought it was winter and we didn't get to use them. We used the indoor pool, workout facility and spa which were all great.  Though, be prepared to share with residents of the rentals and condos. The TV was great, though I'm not a big tv person, so we didn't use it too much. I would love to give the hotel the four five stars, but there are still a few things I thought were missing, for such an upscale hotel, and those are: - Better coffee. The room includes a pod coffepot and tea and coffee pods.  But, the coffee wasn't as good or as strong as I like, and I was disappointed that there was not a coffee bar or Starbucks in the facility.  On a cold morning, it's a long walk to Michigan Ave. - Better toiletries.  I've stayed in hotels that are not as nice as this one that used Aveda products.  They weren't bad...but they could have been better. - The bathroom doesn't have a fan or a proper door.  You can hear everything coming from there, even peoples feet slipping in the shower, etc.  Seems like something they shouldn't have missed.  If you are on the right side of the room too, you can see people undressing through the crack between the door and the wall - The restaurant did not interest me.  It was too pricey for every day, and there weren't enough vegetarian/vegan friendly options for my friend, who is vegan. - As a Chicago resident, the hotel could do a better job of informing guests of ALL the options for food and entertainment.  They do not list any theatre besides Second City, and when we called the concierge to ask what nearby restaurants that deliver to the hotel, they didn't have many options or any menu books available.  It seems like  they  really want you to eat at Fellini, but with the fact that a bowl of oatmeal costs $12, it can get kind of pricey, especially if you want to do some serious shopping. - Also, the pillows were a little too soft.   I'm pretty picky, though, so that's why I'm so discriminating.  :) All in all it was wonderful-- maybe bring your own pillow and toiletries, and prepare to go out to get coffee if you like it strong.",4
1988,A stylish European style hotel located in the heart of Chicago.  Expect large comfortable rooms with stylish bathrooms.  Standard rooms have bright blue carpet and marble with flecks of iron so you get a very classy upscale feel from all the light reflecting on the walls.   Larger rooms have hardwood floors and a nice separate sitting area (suite) along with a balcony.  Wonderful views abound including views of the Chicago River and Navy Pier on one side and the edge of Millennial Park on the other. Downtown and Michigan Ave. are short walks away.  A great spot.  We've already stayed their twice and we plan to return once the weather warms up.,5
1989,"Love this place. The interior is gorgeoussss. Everything is shiny, textures everywhere, colors and mirrors... very modern yet comfortable. Okay, now on to the ramblings. Excuse the unorganized paragraph(s) below. Our room was amazing! The second you enter, there's the smell of freshly laid out wood floors... which to me, smells great!  We got a corner room facing Millennium Park and the room itself was surrounded with floor-to-ceiling windows. LOVE IT! We got our own balcony which wrapped around the room (unfortunately, this didn't get much use due to the cold weather.) Awesome King Bed with pillows I wanted to steal. The shower has a rain fall shower head and also a wand that sprays water which after using once, I couldn't figure out how to turn on again. There's a huge bathtub to relax in. Cool little corner toilet which you can close off. And all this is WHITE WHITE WHITE - in other words.. CLEAN! Heater kept us warm. Large flat screen TV if that's important to ya. Free Wi-Fi. Free coffee/tea station in the room. Ipod/radio deck. Wine glasses, mugs, cups, AND to-go cups. bottle opener with a cork screw attached to it. Mini-bar/fridge. What else? 1 robe (why one?), ironing board, laptop sized safe.. plenty of conveniently placed plugs/outlets to charge phones and cameras. Literally like a block or so away from beautiful Millennium park. Few blocks from the trains. There's a CVS next door. Fillini downstairs is beautiful. We had two free drinks voucher so stopped by and had fancy cocktails before heading out. There are two floors dedicated to a pool area, game room (which consists of a pool table and cards table), a community room with a fireplace, food area with microwaves, gym with brand new equipment (lots of it!), basketball court, sauna & steam room, outdoor garden and running track. What doesn't this hotel have, right? If we weren't limited on time, I would've liked to actually use all the amenities. Best of all... they allow check out time as late as 6pm!! (depends on availability)... 6pm! That's practically a whole 'nother day/night. We didn't have to rush out of the hotel early with no where to go and luggages in tow. Although, I felt kinda bad because the house cleaner wanted to finish our room so she could leave for the day... I would definitely recommend this hotel. Location is away from the noise and people, but still close enough to enjoy what Chicago has to offer.",5
1990,"Great location if you are taking the commuter train to Chicago. I actually drove this trip and parked in the Millennium Garages. We walked out of the north end of the garage and the hotel was just in front of us. It was great. We could see Lake Michigan and the end of Navy pier from our north facing room. We did not get a room with a balcony, but since it was only 20 degrees F, we didn't need the balcony. We did not use the indoor lap pool or spa, however, it looked inviting. It is truly a lap pool, which I have not seen in a hotel before. Not much room for the kids to  splash around. I suspect the outdoor pool would be more fun for kids in the summer. The decor is modern and a little ""flashy"" for my taste, but it is a well appointed room and large compared to some we have stayed in downtown Chicago. Free wireless throughout the hotel. Easy access to bus and train stations.",5
1991,Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Room was a little small but comfortable. Missed having a tub but shower was spacious. Free Wi-Fi and cable. Their restaurant Filini was delicious. We had breakfast there. A little pricey but worth it. Only drawback was that they never left regular coffee and my husband needs his caffeine in the morning. I called for some but no one ever showed. Thank goodness for the CVS downstairs. Overall a very nice stay and conveniently located in the heart of the city and right next to millennium park. Look for deals on http://hotel.com,4
1992,We recently stayed at this hotel for the grand opening.  The room and views are magnificent.  We loved the hardwood floors in the room and also had a balcony.  I would highly recommend this hotel on your next stay to Chicago. Tip:  If you want a balcony room when you book your rate look at the detail of the rate and you can see if it has a balcony or not listed.,5
1993,"I stayed here in March on my first visit to Chicago, and it was fantastic. It is definitely my favorite hotel I have ever the stayed at. The staff were very polite and kind, the amenities and room features were amazing, and I could not have asked for a better experience. I loved the urban, exotic, foreign feel to the place and it was terrific. I loved the decor, it was so unique! When I was staying there, a group of architects were on a tour, so I picked up a few fun facts from them. The bricks in the lobby are from old Chicago streets! and the fireplace in the lobby is the longest fireplace in the United States. The gold decor on the one wall is handmade by a world renowned artist. It's a really neat place to stay and I really enjoyed it! The downside: it's next to a fire station. You might wake up to a siren ever now and then, but the location is really great as well. We were touring Loyola University Chicago and had nowhere to put our luggage during the tour after we checked out, so the staff were very kind and stored it for us until we were finished with our visit. Overall, I had a great experience and really enjoyed it there! It is worth the extra bucks if you're only there for a night or two. :)",5
1994,Never was a Radiasson fan but with Blu...I am in!   They are even cooler in Europe but the one in Chicago was good.   Restaurant was not my taste but great environment.,5
1995,"Great stay.  We were in awe over practically everything in this hotel.  Well decorated.  Modern, but still warm and inviting.  Room was clean, which is always a good feeling.  Loved the complimentary coffee & tea maker.  Definitely came in handy in the morning.   It's obvious that they are still working out some kinks, though.  We tried to use our complimentary drinks with our breakfast but after we placed the order they called us back ten minutes later to say they couldn't serve alcohol until 11am.   It took 3 visits to our door to get us some honey that we asked for when we ordered.  Also, they would do well to expand on their room service breakfast menu.   Otherwise, it was a great time.  I'd definitely recommend it!",4
1996,"We were traveling from California to Chicago for the very first time. Prior to booking a hotel we did a lot of research online. Ultimately, we chose to book with Radisson Blu Aqua and I couldn't have been happier. A wonderful high end hotel & residence located in the heart of downtown Chicago's River North district.  We stayed for 5 days & 4 nights and every time we entered and left we were greeted by the doormen & other hotel staff. This hotel is state of the art in design and services. It ascends above the city and offers great views of downtown. It offers a sleek, sophisticated atmosphere, refined service and sweeping views at every turn. It's located just blocks from Chicago landmarks, such as, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, Michigan Ave (high end shopping), and the Chicago Riverwalk. We rented a car from Midway Airport upon our arrival but we quickly realized that traveling by foot is much easier and faster. This may sound crazy, but Chicago traffic is 10x worse than in Los Angeles. Another downside, valet parking (with in/out privileges) is $45.00 a day at this hotel. A cab ride from the hotel to anywhere downtown cost us an average of 5-7 bucks one way. Another reason to walk or take a cab is because parking is a nightmare and very expensive throughout Chicago. If the weather was better we would have walked everywhere. Although the Filini bar is located in the lobby of this hotel, I did not factor my feelings into the 5 star hotel rating because they have their own yelp page. With that being said, I give Filini 1 star for food, service, and price of food versus quality. This place is full of hoity toity, pretentious individuals who wear designer clothing and think they are cooler than you. The service was horrible and I think the bartender forgot to put alcohol in our cocktails. Maybe because we were wearing jeans and t-shirts but we just spent the entire day walking around Chicago and wanted to end the night with food and a cocktail.... Ok back to the hotel... Our room had no refrigerator but it did have a coffee pot. There is a CVS Pharmacy directly next door where you can find cheap souvenirs, snacks, and a nice selection of alcohol (to stock up your room). Another great option for snacks, groceries, or alcohol is Mariano's Fresh Market which is located to the south of the hotel (3-5 minute walk). My fiancé and I both packed our gym outfits and had good intentions of using the fully furnished gym, but we found ourselves occupied with other activities. All in all, this is a great hotel in a great location. The rooms are beautiful and the views are amazing.",5
1997,"The rooms were clean and impressive. However, I was disappointed that mine did not have balcony access. The bathrooms were large and very modern and we loved the the soaps and shampoos. Because it was winter I didn't get a feel for the rooftop amenities but I can't wait to come back in the summer.",5
1998,"Great deal, great staff. Great city view for now, but construction has started on a new building that will probably block the view of Lake Michigan, so enjoy it for now. Room was fantastic. Staff are very friendly , and helpful!",5
1999,"Love. love, LOVE this hotel!  Attentive staff, beautiful decor, incredibly comfortable beds.  All at a very affordable price, especially for this area of the city.  The room was beautiful (we had the Mansion Room with the dark wood), shower pressure, which usually stinks at most hotels, was fantastic. I look forward to returning very soon!",5
2000,"Only stayed for one night.  However, room was clean and comfortable.  Bed was comfortable, nice bathroom, decent decor.  The service and the food were good.  The overall feel of the hotel is warm, yet modern.",4
2001,"Me and my wife stayed here during our trip to Chitown in May. A brand-spanking-new place that I believe just opened late last year. Very lovely lobby area...a firepit that extends along one wall, comfy lounging couches, lots of luxury. The room was on the smaller side but very comfortable with a big bathroom and rather large shower. It is in a perfect location, a few minutes south of the Chicago River and a block from Grant/Millenium parks..so you have those attractions plus the Mag Mile and a slew of restaurants within walking distance. I would knock off half a star because room service was very poor as far as replacing coffee..they would give me two decafs instead of a regular, but I am too easy going of a guy to be that harsh and will have to round up to a five star, because I would def. stay here again. Plus, they have their own Andriod app that is actually really cool and benificial for checking airlines, reservations, getting taxi service, checking out there restaurant (which we went to for breakfast twice and was really good), etc. The manager seems very commited to providing the absolute best for the hotels guests as he seems to respond to a lot of comments on here and it is nice to see someone who cares. Great job with this wonderful hotel, see you again soon.",5
2002,"Stayed here while visiting family in the area. The room was lovely, very comfortable. We had dinner one night in the Italian themed restaurant -- my risotto was top notch, my son's fettucini great, and my wife's salad also great. Good chianti by the glass if a bit sparing on the pour. The pools on the third floor (indoor and outdoor) are designed for lap swimming.",4
2003,"Love this place!!  Had a huge corner room w/ wrap around balcony w/ views of millenium park.  Smells new, very clean, which is a huge plus!  Husband and I just stayed the night and used almost all the amenities.  Drinks in the lounge area, next to the gorgeous fireplce...very relaxing.  Dessert in the filini bar, then hot tubbing in the pool area.  I also used the gym in the morning, and thought it was the best hotel gym i have ever used!  Very reasonably priced, even w/o the groupon price we paid.  Also, we parked @ MIllenium garage, which is literally a block and a half away, for only $24, instead of the hotels $46. Would love to return someday",5
2004,"I stayed at this hotel the weekend after valentines day as a treat to my fiance.  Initially I had reserved to stay at the Martiott on the mag mile on north michigan. After reading reviews and looking at pictures, the marriott didn't have that wow factor I was looking for. Radisson aqau blu had it all. From the structure of the building to the lobby entrance down to the bathroom in the room, I was impressed.  check in was fast and worry free. They were accommodating and made sure we had what we needed. Our room was awesome! Modern, clean, and relaxing. Carpet was aqua blu which was nice with marble floors and countertops in foyer and bathroom. it was definitely worth every penny spent! Our next stay will be in an executive suite for sure. If you need a place to stay I'd definitely recommend this place for your needs including dining.",5
2005,"Stayed one night this weekend with reward points.  This hotel just opened on 10/31/11, so as you can imagine, everything was very nice and new.  Starting with the lobby, not being a big expert on decor, I would describe it as ultra modern, fixtures were very cool, the bar area and restaurant was very modern and had a sheik look to it.  One thing I like is that the room we had (and from what it looked like, all or almost all the rooms had) a nice sized balcony.  The rooms were very nice, bathroom had a sliding door into the bathroom, then a 'dual purpose' sliding door that slid over to close if you were in the toilet area or close if you were in the shower area.  Shower was very nice, overhead 'rain' faucet I really liked.  Nice flat screen TV in the room and FREE wireless internet.  I would recommend the hotel, very impressive.",4
2006,"Every Holiday my wife and I try out a new downtown Chicago hotel and enjoy a nice dinner, a show and shopping.  Having just returned from this hotel, I would highly recommend a stay.   Consistent with the other reviews to date, the property is a very appealing modern design.  There are two room decors.  Our room had a gloss black porcelain (marble?) flooring and aqua carpet.  I like that our room was not rectangular and had an alcove with the desk, chair with side table and the flat panel TV.  We also appreciated a balcony with river and lake views.  If it weren't winter, you'd could really enjoy spending time out there.  The bed was very comfortable although a little on the firmer side (though plenty soft, just not a heavenly bed).  There were great down pillows and lots of them.  The room has all the amenities you'd want including nice toiletries, single cup coffee maker, mini-bar, wi-fi, etc.  The common spaces also feature striking design.  The lobby is especially impressive with a massive gas fireplace (probably 75 feet long) and comfortable seating that makes you want to linger.  It's just a great looking contemporary hotel. The staff could not have been more friendly.  While the hotel is still in start up mode, everyone was genuinely and naturally friendly.  We found this to be true of the front desk staff, housekeeping, the lounge staff and those in the restaurant.  We especially liked breakfast.  While on the expensive side, or pretty typical for higher end hotels, the food was especially good.  Try the crepes!  They are wonderful. The only downside I can see is the cost of parking at $51.  We knew this in advance and parked next door at an Illinois Center garage for $30.  Just a pet peeve of mine, as I'm happy to pay for a nice room and good service, but I hate how all the downtown hotels gouge you on parking or don't offer a package that includes parking. We did not use the pool but there is a nice two lane lap pool and hot tub plus health club.  The location was also very convenient to Millenium park, loop theaters and Michigan Avenue.  In short, this hotel was everything we wanted for a relaxing, quick escape from the burbs.",5
2007,"first time stay! great hotel,great service. beds are comfortable and large showers. first class gym with sauna and steam room",5
2008,"I am not sure what this hotel is like inside, but I know the customer service is horrible. I tried to reserve a block of rooms here for my wedding - called three times and sent one e-mail and never got a response, even after talking to someone on the phone. She promised to send me information on rates and availability and then radio silence. I even called twice to follow up. Nothing.  I guess they don't need the business.",1
2009,"You may want to look at another hotel for a wedding reception.  It is a beautiful spot and the ballroom is large with a view which is rare in downtown Chicago, but the service is lacking and it is way overpriced.  I placed several calls and emails over the course of 2 weeks to set up a meeting with their event coordinator and received no response.  I never heard from her until I sent an email to her boss.  When we finally met she gave the impression she didn't like her job and was unprepared. She then floored me with the 5 star hotel price and they are only a 4 star hotel.  She also told me other events could be booked the same day,  only food can be put to the minimum (which you will only meet buying the highest priced package), and anyone can walk through the cocktail hour (the residents enter through that door).",1
2010,"We just got home from a two-night stay at the Blu Aqua.  Overall - the experience was terrific. The staff goes out of their way to be friendly and helpful.   We had a Groupon for a king room.  I had asked for possible upgrades - including $9/night for park view.  On check-in, we were told we got that upgrade.  I'm not positive the view we had was really what was meant by ""park view"".  We were in 1007 - facing north. Looking straight out - we looked into an office building.  If we looked right  we could see Navy Pier and the river.  Looking left - we could see a sliver of the Wrigley building.  We did not face the park.  I'm not sure if that upgrade included Navy Pier views OR Millenium Park, so we didn't say something. I'm not sure the view we had was worth $9 a night. The room was relatively compact - but nicely laid out.  I loved how clean and new it was.  There was a wood-laminate floor - with marble floor  in the entry area and bathroom.  We had a king bed with great bedding.  It was very comfortable (though the pillows were rather ""mushy"" - it was good we had 6 of them).  The bathroom was beautiful - with a separate soaking tub and walk in shower.  It was also very spacious.   The sliding door to the bathroom was fine for us - but I could see if you were sharing a room with someone other than a spouse, it could be a problem privacy-wise.  It definitely didn't muffle any noises from the bathroom!   The closet area was laid out nicely with three drawers and a good-sized safe.   The hanging area, however, was a bit small.  It was ok for us for just 2 nights - but for a longer stay with 2 people or more - it'd be tough.   There was a good-sized flat screen TV and desk area.   The public areas were very nice.  We enjoyed the bar - and had breakfast one morning in the restaurant.  The food and service were excellent.   We didn't use the indoor lap pool and spa or health club.  The health club area was very large with great equipment and even a half basketball court.   In the lobby area - there were a lot of areas to sit and lounge.   We were rather surprised by the $51/night charge for parking.  That seems rather high to me, particularly as we didn't use or ask for in/out privileges.   We would definitely come back.  It could be nice in the summer with that outdoor pool area.",5
2011,My husband and I stayed at the Radisson Blu Aqua last weekend for two nights. We loved this hotel! Everyone at the hotel was very nice and helpful with questions or quick to respond with requests for additional towels.  The rooms are beautifully decorated and very very quiet. The beds and pillows were high end and very comfortable. We loved the book lights on each side of the bed too. The bathroom had a spa like zen feel. The restaurant and staff were fantastic.  One evening we went down to the bar for a nightcap and found the ambiance very romantic and relaxing too. We will definitely be back!,5
2012,"The hotel opened in the fall of 2011. It's very modern, yet warm and inviting. We found the staff to be consistently welcoming and helpful. There is an outdoor running track, indoor and outdoor pools, a huge workout room, and more. Our room was quiet and comfortable with many touches of beauty. The concierge arrange deep tissue massages that were world class. The hotel is a block from Millenium Park and within walking distance of Navy Pier and many other attractions. Filini restaurant is in the hotel and we found it quite enjoyable. We can't wait to go back!",5
2013,We recently purchased a one night stay through a coupon group and right from the time of booking through checkout our service was impeccable. The hotel was outstanding and spotless. The modern decor took our breath away. All areas of the hotel were spotless and for a busy hotel in this area of Chicago I find it so refreshing that even the air in the hallways and elevators seemed as if it were conditioned for our comfort. The staff was so nice to our two young grandchildren that we decided to have dinner in the on-site restaurant Felinni and this too was of top quality and so very reasonably priced for Chicago. We will make it a point to rebook if the opportunity should arise.,5
2014,"Great for business travel.  You're right downtown, an easy walk to the towers, and really not that far of a walk or short cab ride to a ton of evening dining or bar & grilles.  If you're lucky enough to get a river side room (50% chance), you can't beat the view, and as the hotel is the upper floors of an office building, you're never lower than 15. Inside amenities are normal for a Holiday Inn in a business end of town.  On the main floor is an over-priced bar but with a nice view, and a relatively attractive looking but otherwise mediocre restaurant (at least for breakfast as I didn't use it any other time).  Floor 16 hosts an indoor pool (a little small for those really into lap swimming, but otherwise just fine) and a fitness room with a good amount of cardio, some free weights, and a few awkwardly placed cable/smith setups.  You can get in a good enough exercise to do the job.   If you want more, the internal stairs are all open for use between floors 15 and 23, so you can make use of those as well. Rooms are average for a HI; OK quality mattress, smattering of lower-end wood furniture, in-room WiFi (free), mini-coffee setup, ironing board, room service, etc.   I was happy to see that the bathrooms were updated at some point.  Only thing I didn't like was the air conditioning unit from 1974 that was the size of a piece of furniture and as loud as an idling car when on (which it had to be a lot for this week of 90+ weather), but a few ear plugs to make it through the night and you're good as the rest of the hotel was nice and quiet. For the price and location, this is a great business stay.",4
2015,"My wife and I booked a room through Priceline from 9/6-9/10.  As you can see I'm reviewing on 9/8, because I've checked out early.  It was so bad I opted to lose the last night I prepaid on and eat the loss because it was so bad.  The one saving grace, and sole reason I'm going with 2 stars is because the hotel did refund my last day of stay. As I said we booked a room through Priceline name you own price.  We requested a room with a view.  Upon checking in they told us the room did have a view, but once we got their, it did not.  We took in the basic interior room they gave us and asked about upgrading.  They said we could upgrade for a $20 a day charge.  So we did because they hotel room was SO DATED.  If I hadn't entered in through the Chicago Sun Times building I would have thought I was in public housing. After upgrading to a King room with a view, which they also informed us that they couldn't do this for free because we booked through Priceline, we tried getting settled in.  If you didn't catch that, they saved the worst rooms in the hotel for the Priceline guests.  They penalized us for booking through a 3rd party. Be warned, the pictures posted online for this hotel show some very nice rooms.  Those were not the rooms we saw.  The hotel is so dated, it's like going back in time.  My wife described the bed linnens as scratchy.  If there was one word to accurately described this hotel it is DATED. So finally we had a room with an amazing view of downtown.  However the room is still extremely dated.  We stayed for the first two nights of our trip.  But after waking up with our backs aching from the awful, awful bed we opted to move to another hotel.  Both mornings we woke up feeling like we'd been in a wrestling match and our backs were so kinked we were literally in pain. We will never stay at this hotel again.  It was easily the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in Chicago.",2
2016,"THIS HOTEL IS HORRIBLE! I've stayed at this Holiday Inn before and use it for work bookings often since my company is located in the Merchandise Mart but I will never stay there again and advocating all of our out of town guests do the same. I had a reservation for last weekend and received a confirmation number the week before I was supposed to check in. I had guests that were unable to make it so I got online and cancelled (there is no cancellation fee). I received my confirmation, everything was good. But when I logged onto my bank this weekend, they billed me for 2 of the 3 rooms I had reserved. When I called to say I cancelled online and gave them my confirmation number, they told me that all rooms were booked under that confirmation number but they had separate booking IDs and I needed to cancel each one of them. When I previously went online to cancel the reservation, there were NO OPTIONS for that and it did not tell you that you were only cancelling one room, not the entire reservation. I will never stay at the Holiday Inn again and suggest you go ANY other hotel downtown and receive better customer service",1
2017,"I booked this trip on Priceline and snagged a great deal for the location. I called to ask for two doubles and a non-smoking room and they did give me a fair warning that since I booked through a 3rd party, that they would try their best. Did end up getting the 2 beds in a handicap accessible room. The rooms were not as renovated as you'd expect from seeing the lobby but the amenities of a nice view, pool/gym, restaurant and bar make up for that. Pros: Cool factor of a 15th floor lobby above the Chicago Sun Times building Fantastic views of the city from the bar and restaurant Open atrium lobby In hotel upscale bar and restaurant with room service options Friendly check in staff Flat screen TVs Rooms with ""span the width of the room"" windows with nice city views Pool and gym Lounge like lobby area for work, reading, or chatting Walkway from Merchandise Mart CTA station is priceless. You can walk straight off the CTA station through the mart and take the elevators onto the hotel lobby on the 15th floor. Cons: Really outdated rooms with sparse furniture Beds that need replacing Overpriced drinks Location is far from any dining options within walking distance except for close to River North (expensive)",3
2018,"The fact that the hotel is on the 15th floor and up gives it a fancier feel than other places, but the rooms are your typical Holiday Inn rooms. My major complaint is the counter space in the bathroom. You get one little triangle sink for all your stuff. Try that out for three girls and one guy. The staff is so nice and accommodating. We would ask the maids in the hallway for tissues boxes and towels, and they were always courteous and friendly. I love the grand entrances from the street and the lobby. The front of the taxi area looks out to the river and skyline. Perfect for pictures. The bar they have on the 15th floor has a great view as well. You can get an expensive drink and watch the sunset. There is an indoor pool and a bad and pricey hotel restaurant. If you are lucky enough to get a room with a riverfront view, your windows will probably be open 24/7 because the view is gorgeous. The location is a little far from the touristy stuff. You will probably need to take a taxi.",3
2019,"We stayed here for a wedding in the same hotel.  Not only was the wedding itself amazing, but the accommodations were great! Every person we met who worked at the hotel was helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable, clean and surprisingly quiet.  We faced the river and the Metra station - I thought it would be loud, but it wasn't at all. The views are the real winner here.  It was a picture each time you looked out the window. The pool was big and my kids made sure we stopped there daily. The restaurant had a great menu with some excellent french fries!  We enjoyed the lunch/dinner menus.  We had breakfast there a couple of times. The buffet was ok - but I preferred to order off the menu. The pancakes were great! I'm a big fan of the hotel bar. It was a little pricey - but worth the location!! I can't wait to stay there again!",5
2020,"Stayed here for one night. Not a bad place but the rooms were a little outdated and it was in an isolated area.  Since i'm from Chicago, I navigated the area pretty well but for first timers, it may have been a little challenge.  It's VERY quiet after 8pm over there. Not far from the nightlife on Hubbard Street and decent staff(except for the one guy who gave me the wrong room and had an attitude). I got a $90 room from priceline but i DO NOT recommend paying $230 which is the regular price. There is a nice bar there with a view but we didn't go there. It's a no frills, decent hotel with slow free wi-fi.  It's definitely not high-end.  Also, parking is a cool $35 outdoors FYI.",3
2021,"I was prepared to hate this hotel. Previous one-star ratings had me terrified (particularly the bed bug review). I searched immediately when I arrived - no bed bugs, nice room, great view, friendly staff. I would stay here again and be happy. Not sure why the bad reviews. Bottom line: nice hotel in a great location.",4
2022,"This is a fabulous hotel! I had friends that stayed here over the weekend, and it was perfect!  (I didn't stay here, but I did visit them, saw their room, wandered around the hotel, and used the concierge service with them). I think the hotel is in a great location.  It's easy to get anywhere downtown, in river north, or off the brown line. This place has amazing views!  The views from the rooms are stunning, the views from the bar are incredible, the views from random areas in the lobby are outstanding.  Really, the view is that great. The room was nice. I think what makes this place amazing is the staff.  I got a flat on my bike on the way to visiting them.  Since there are no gas stations particularly close, I thought I would see if the hotel's garage had an air compressor/some type of pump.  We asked the concierge.  The concierge called the engineer, but didn't get a response, so he called the nearby Ace Hardware and quoted me 2 pumps.  We didn't get to Ace until they had closed.  So when we returned from dinner we asked the concierge to ask the engineer again.  He called the engineer down to meet with us.  The engineer was able to blow up the tire.  The staff were so friendly and so helpful!   My friends had a great time, and plan to stay here again anytime they need a hotel in the city in the future! Oh, parking is $40 per night, while that's a lot, it's not crazy for the area.",5
2023,"I recently got married and had my reception at the Wolf Point Ballroom at Holiday Inn Merchandise Mart Plaza. First of all, the views are of downtown Chicago are breathtaking.  I'm not being biased but I really think the views from the ballroom are the best in the city.  You get views of both branches of the Chicago river. It's beautiful during the day and even more amazing at night.  Our guests complimented us all night long about the view. It's pretty incredible. Next the food is really delicious! We got married on a Friday and had the celebration buffet package.  The package itself is pretty reasonable and the food was delicious. We had Caesar salad, prime rib, chicken, mashed potatoes, fruit, and grilled vegetables. Everything was super delicious. The prime rib and the chicken were juicy and very tasty. The cake, which we got through the package from Alliance bakery was very moist and delicious. We got compliments on the food/cake from our guests as well :D Last but definitely not least, the Event Coordinator, Barbara Martin is just fabulous. She is organized, responds promptly and is very nice to work with.  She was one of the reasons we booked the venue. We knew with Barbara that we would be in good hands. Throughout the planning process we had great communication and she was extremely helpful getting things in order the day of the wedding. The Holiday Inn was recently remodeled with the newly added Wolf Point room. I think the secret is now getting out on how great it is.  The prices are very reasonable for a downtown venue. I think choosing the Holiday Inn as our venue was the best decision we made in our planning process",5
2024,"I've stayed here twice - once with my family in 2010 and once for work in 2012.  Location was good for the work thing I had in River North, not so good for the touristy stuff I did with family.  If you're not familiar with the city and stay here be prepared to cab it.  Both times I ended up with ""interior view"" rooms, but if the view from the bar is any indication the city-view rooms probably have a very nice view of downtown. Lobby is nice and staff was friendly.  Inside could use some TLC, but it's not horrible.  The 15th floor thing is weird but they have elevators inside that go straight to the hotel.  I would probably stay here again if the room was $150/under and I had a reason to be nearby.",3
2025,"Cheep & grate location. Eye can sea the Sears Tower! & the Chicago Reever! Perfect place, nice lobby. Merchandise Mart stop on the Brown & the sometimes running Purple Lines makes this uber-convenient.",5
2026,"I went to a conference here and it was nice and convenient. There were some issues with the heating and cooling, but it was fixed rather quickly. The validated parking was nice, and the complete indoor access to a good portion of downtown Chicago was great.",4
2027,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had.  Reserved a non-smoking room, king bed with a view, got a room that reeked of cigar smoke with no view.  When we complained we were moved to a smaller room, no view and double beds.  Again complained and were ""comped"" a meal that was average at best.  Then had a hard time getting a coffee pot for the room (I believe that they thought we'd stolen one) and getting housekeeping to change our room within the 6 hours we were out at a conference.  Holiday Inn is not a place I'd recommend to others if they are looking for a good experience.",1
2028,"The view was amazing from this 20th Floor Bedroom. As a priority Club platinum member, the check in was fast. If you are one of these Platinum menber hoping for an upgrade, don't get your hopes to high, while I stayed more than 130 nights, and the absolute highest status available they  have "" no upgrades"".  That's ok. My real disappointment was with the internet. It simply does not work. I could not check email it would time out. You can't visit any pages, even http://delta.com would not load without timing out. This has been thru since I got here. From time to time it works ok ( I guess when there is less users) but it lasts just for a few minutes. While it's a regular holiday inn with a beautiful view, it is horrible for the business traveler who needs to check receive email or anything else internet related. I gave up and went down to a coffee shop (quite a ways out) to work and came back to the hotel later. If you need internet while you travel, Forget it!. Their network just can't handle it! Thanks",3
2029,"For-a-fee self-parking was the only option, expensive ($39 per night) and inconvenient (clerk claimed to have validated parking for two nights, but did not, so it held up my departure the following morning due to the parking gate not opening for me). Poor room size, furnishings, and amenities. Very poor view (interior 'courtyard' view of pool roof and concrete wall only). The separate main atrium had a very cold appearance and feel, could use color and/or planters in the 10+ levels of visible corridors. Clothes iron leaked water all over my dress shirt in the morning, so I had to reuse a shirt from the previous day, which is important not to do when visiting clients, or even coworkers. The clerk I brought the faulty iron to did not even ask what she could do to make my stay better, let alone apologize for the inconvenience. The front desk staff member who re-validated my parking was rude and confrontational. I waited in line for 5 minutes to re-validate something that was supposed to have been done the night before, and while 2 visitors were awaiting me in my rental car in the parking lot below. She initially said ""no way"" to being able to validate the parking, since I was going to spend that second night with my family nearby, even though 3 members of my party were staying the night at the same Holiday Inn. Finally, when the supervisor was involved, he took care of me right away. Validating a parking ticket should not be brain surgery, but the first clerk and the second ""rude"" one seemed to not understand the system or customer service at all. To add insult to injury, the self-serve breakfast BUFFET was $22, and they had the gall to include a line item for tip in the breakfast bill. I stayed/ate at a Hilton Garden Inn the previous two mornings, and their $11 breakfast buffet was better than this, and neither was much better than the FREE breakfast buffet at a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express. One last complaint: the business center charges for printing (except for boarding passes). Overall, this was the worst hotel stay that I have had in many years. ""Value"" was definitely missing from this particular hotel, even if my experience might not be representative of the whole chain. My preoccupation with these negative points brings forth a disturbing trend: hotels are keeping room charges at an apparently reasonable rate, but then are gouging guests with expensive parking rates, sky-high breakfast prices, extra-cost printing and sometimes internet service. In the end, it is better to stick with the Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn Express, which include these items as standard.",1
2030,"Good thing this was not my first time..... We stayed here again on a recent weekend visit.  I have to say, if this were my first time here, I would not stay again. We arrived early, but luckily our room was ready so we could get settled.  We were ""upgraded"" to a suite.  I say ""upgraded"" because although the room was big, spacious, and clean, the room was right next to the service elevator.  This made for a very loud banging most of the morning.  As soon as I would fall back to sleep, BANG! another set of doors opening and closing. The bathroom in the suite was awesome as was the quasi living room, but the desk was kind of banged up and the wi-fi password changed between check in time of noon and 7:00 pm.  What's up with that? I will stay here again because the location is convenient and the staff could not be nicer, but I will be specific in my request to not be next to this elevator or any other room that ends in 48.",3
2031,"I work in the Mart, and this is the spot that we use to put up our customers or out-of-town coworkers.  Its a big PRO that its attached via skywalk to the Mart, has a cute bar with a great view, and has its own restaurant.  I also think they have been renovating the rooms. My word of advice if you're an out-of-towner coming for the weekend is that it is more of a 9 to 5 M-F kinda place and the taxi sitch can be a bit dicey after like 7 or 8 pm.  While it may look centrally located on a map, its a bit out of the way for doing anything in the main hub on the weekend.  That being said, they prob also have great weekend rates, and if you don't mind hoofing it a bit it could be a good deal.  they also have tons of parking!",4
2032,"I used Priceline to find an excellent deal for this hotel (one of their secret deals where they don't tell you who the hotel is until you pay for it.) The hotel is near a few different train stops (brown line is the closest) and within walking distance to shopping and food. The room itself was a normal size room, smallish bathroom and we had a great view of a partial wall and the indoor pool :) I will say, the water pressure in our bathroom was very low. The hotel bar has a fantastic view, and might be one of the best views I have seen in a hotel bar. The drink prices are on par for a hotel as are the room service prices. There is a short indoor walk to a small food court that included a McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts and their famous popcorn place (can't remember the name). Dunkin Donuts came in handy for our morning coffee. Overall an excellent deal and a nice place to stay.",4
2033,"Great for business travel.  I had a great room with a view of the river.  I was worried because my room was right in front of the elevators, but it was not a problem I couldn't hear anything outside of my room. The woman that checked us into our rooms, was  rather rude and unattentive to our needs.  She didn't even tell us what elevator to take to get to our rooms, other than that we had a very good tray.",4
2034,"Hmm Where to begin.. I like the positives so I'll go that way.. The Good - The room was comfortable.. There is a good amount of space inside the rooms, the shower/bathroom were pretty good.  All in all the room was ok.. The Bad.. and it begins. Staff - I didn't encounter one person that I would say did a stellar job.  The problems started with the shitty attitude of the bell hop and went from there.. The Pillows - Painful. Seriously horrible. The Location - It's really confusing to try and find the actual hotel inside the merchandise mart.. there isn't enough signage. The location is also pretty shitty in terms of access/things you would want to do.  Sure it's on the brown line.. but that's the problem, I NEVER use the brown line.",1
2035,"We did our hotel room block here at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. Considering your not in the room a whole lot, they offered the best rate around! Rooms were great, everyone received a room with a view of the river which are great views! Room sizes were larger than the typical room too. We were given a corner room, very nice! Beds are comfortable, with your choice of pillow (soft or firm). There is an indoor pool too, which our nephews enjoyed. I walked in there once and it was nice, not overwhelming hot or chlorine smelling as most indoor pools tend to be. Large open lobby great for meeting up and taking wedding photo's. Lobby bar is nice too, which they had later hours. Pizza is good in there as well. Overall I would recommend the hotel for others, it's away from the mag mile and all the regular touristy area's however it's perfect for wedding room blocks for reasonable price!",4
2036,"This review is not based on staying as a guest in a room, but a review for it as a wedding venue.  I officiated my friends wedding here and helped with a lot of the planning details.   When I heard my friends were getting married at the Holiday Inn because it was a fantastic deal, I was happy that they found something that fit their budget, but I wasn't expecting it to be super classy.  I was so wrong. Barbara, the in-house the wedding planner was a breeze for the bride and groom to work with.  She was calm and thought of everything.  I too found communicating with her to be very easy.   The food was well beyond my expectations. The salad was not your average crank them out wedding salad.  The greens were fresh, the string beans delicious.  If you told me I was eating local organic produce, I would have believed you.  The steaks were so thick and delicious you would have thought this was a $150 per plate wedding meal, which I'm sure it was not.  The Holiday Inn outsources their cakes to Alliance Bakery.  I'm not a big wedding cake fan - because most just aren't that great.  This one was fantastic.  (Chocolate buttercream, chocolate cake, raspberry filling.) The venue let our friends bring in their own beer from outside.  This is unheard of at a hotel wedding venue.  Upcharging alcohol is a big part of how they make their money.  But our friends were able to pick up fantastic beer and bring it in to be served at the bar.  It saved them a bundle. They had an open bar all night long.  I'm not big into mixed drinks so I cannot comment on that aspect. Free rooms were included for the bride and groom and parents on the night of the wedding.  The couple said that nice perks like that were present throughout their whole experience. The only things I did not like were: They typically don't provide a holding room for the wedding party to wait in.  The part of the room where they stood for their ceremony had an exit door and exit sign right behind them.  Not the most beautiful backdrop to a wedding ceremony.  And when the clock struck leaving time - they threw on the florescent lights and herded everyone out as though it were a police raid.  I have worked catering and understand well the need to get guests out so crew can start to breakdown.  I'm sure their method was effective in doing so, but they could have used some more tact.   These negatives were minor compared to the service, the good price, the good food, and great views. I think this is one of the best kept secrets as far as Chicago wedding venues go.  Five stars indeed.",5
2037,"We booked this room very last minute on July 3rd on Hotwire. I did a little research and had figured it was HI-Mart and for the price (100 with tax) and how late it was when checking in (2AM) I figured the room wasn't going to matter too much. The parking was very easy and compared to other city hotels was reasonably priced for staying the night with in and out. I believe it was right around $34. The check in was quick and easy, as it should be at 2AM. Although the guy checking us in wasn't very talkative or warm to us. The room was a very large with a king bed and a sitting area. The view was not of much however this hotel does offer some amazing views. I would actually say some of the best in the city because of it's position. A definite plus to this hotel. Some things that bother me about hotels that HI had on the list. 1. I hate when electronics aren't in working order when walking into room. The TV was unplugged, the batteries needed changed in the remote and the clock needed set as it was  blinking. All simple things but also all simple things for the hotel staff to check on to make sure the room looks put together. 2. No info on Chicago in the room or info about the hotel. There was no book anywhere about restaurants in hotel, if room service was provided beyond breakfast, pool hours, etc. 3. Two VERY small pillows in the room isn't sufficient. Overall, I wouldn't stay again but it WAS  a great hotel for a quick sleep in Chicago. I prefer a hotel with a more boutique feel and attention. Also, for me, the location wasn't ideal to being where I like to be in Chicago. For a family trip, reunion or even a guys weekend, I think this hotel would fit well. However, for couples looking to relax and have a nice weekend together I think you'd be better fit at a more boutique hotel.",3
2038,"Reserved 3 rooms this past weekend(5/18/12-5/20/12) for a bachelor party in the city. Rooms themselves were fantastic. Although I received the WORST customer service of my life. I had to call three time during the week to put my friends names on each room so they could check in early. Every time I called they said my name was still on the rooms. I had them change it twice and when my friends got there to check in, my name was STILL on the rooms. I was also told I would get a discounted rate with 2 free breakfasts for EACH room. When my friends checked in, the discounted price was only on one room and it had to changed to all three.  I booked these rooms all together and I had the confirmations stating the prices.  When we tried to get the 2 free breakfasts on Saturday morning they said it was for only one room. I asked to talk to a manager and expressed what I was told over phone and she told me that was not what was said and basically called me a liar. What happened to the customer always being right?  I mean I was trying to scam anyone, just trying to get what I was told I was I supposed to get.  Upon checkout, the front desk person tried to charge me for 4 rooms when I only had 3. I thought we were good once I told him I only had 3. Well when I got home and checked my account, I had 4 charges from the Holiday Inn. We spent a good deal of money at this hotel and did not get the service we should have been given. I am very disappointed with this hotel. I will never stay at a Holiday Inn again!!!!! Terrible!",1
2039,Bare-bones hotel in terms of room and amenities but the view is just absolutely spectacular. Met all my expectations and certainly exceeded it with the bar and the view.,4
2040,"Don't be dissuaded by the 'Holiday Inn' label - this is an upscale hotel (or upscale enough for most travelers' needs) with a mid-range price tag, with clean, comfortable, well-appointed rooms and free WiFi in a great location in Chicago's River North neighborhood. I help host an event (the Chicago(ish) Tweetup) twice a year and the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is our go-to hotel for a variety of reasons: The sales staff is wonderful and always happy and quick to accommodate us, and they even work to find rooms at the group rate for last-minute travelers. The staff at the front desk and concierge are also friendly and willing to assist guests with their needs; I've yet to encounter a rude staff member in my five visits to this location. The rates are reasonable, and their block/AAA/Priority Club rates are often even better (call often to check on AAA rates, as they change from week to week, often going lower the closer to your arrival date). The location is fantastic, with views of the Chicago River and the city's lovely, gritty architecture, whether buildings or bridges. Thanks to the Brown Line Merchandise Mart El stop, it's possible to reach the hotel via public transportation from either major Chicago airport and avoid car rental and parking fees altogether, though check the hours for the Brown Line, as it does not run all night. The Cityscape Lounge is pricey and the service is on the slower side, but it's ideal for a cocktail hour kickoff and the bar food is pretty good. (The view from the lounge is incredible.) The lobby is comfortable and perfect for a larger gathering to congregate, with comfy couches/tuffets and outlets for charging smartphones/tablets. I realize there are higher-end and more affordable places to stay in a city of this size, but the price, service, cleanliness, and sweet location make this hotel the best-kept secret in Chicago.",5
2041,"We recently stayed here for my sister's wedding.  The actual wedding reception was nice enough, as was our room.  However, I have never experienced more abominable customer service in my natural life than what we received here. We reserved over the phone because my sister had a block of rooms reserved at a slightly reduced rate for the wedding guests.  I received an email a couple days before, confirming my reservation.  I was in the bridal party, so I was tied up after the ceremony, and left it to my fiancé to check us in.  As we were out taking photos, he called me in a slight panic telling me that the hotel did not have our reservation.  I said they had just sent me an email and to check again. When we arrived back at the hotel, I got in line to see what the issue was and to try to check in.  The woman looked it up again and said she didn't have it.  When I told her about the confirmation email, she said ""We don't do that"" (not true).  She said I would just have to get into my email and get my confirmation number. She then told me that she had a line of people behind me she needed to help, and basically ordered me to leave the front desk area, implying she needed to help her ""real"" customers!! Because of the hotel's crappy internet I could not get online.  My sister, the bride, who had a million other things to worry about, had to track down the hotel wedding planner, who took me into her office to get on my email.  In looking at the reservation, I saw that they had misspelled my last name.  Now, mind you, they had pulled up our reservation block at the desk and were apparently too inept or lazy to glance through the list and find my name- even though it was misspelled, it was only by ONE LETTER!!  There were only about 20 of us in the block, and they didn't even bother to go through the names one at a time to see if I was there. At this point we asked for the manager. We were missing the reception, and were getting pretty upset. He apologized (kind of) and told us he would have a porter bring my fiancé's bags to our room so that we could go and enjoy the reception. Upon returning to our room late that night, we discovered that none of the bags had been brought up as promised!!!  This included valuable items such as a laptop and camera.  We called the front desk and were told that WE would have to come down and get them.   The final straw was that when I had gone down in the morning for brunch (at $20, a total and complete ripoff, but that's where the wedding party was meeting so I had no choice), I asked at the desk if we could have a slightly later checkout time (1:00 instead of noon) because we were still recovering from the night before.  They said sure, no problem, but then at noon ON THE DOT they were banging on our door. I can't even fathom how the service might have been worse.  The only slightly redeeming thing was the wedding planner helping me out- if it hadn't been for her, I don't know how we would have worked anything out.",1
2042,"Attended a wedding here a few weeks back and overall it was pretty decent.  We enjoyed the Cityscape Bar quite a bit, it's a nice layout w nearly floor to ceiling windows allowing for some great views, right at the bend in the Chicago river.   The food from the reception was above average, considering it was wedding food where it's rarely memorable.  I think it was a NY strip with potatoes and veggies.  The steak a bit overcooked (still v flavorful) but again, to expect a 5 star dining experience when the staff is tasked w serving hundreds of people at the same time, is a stretch and unrealistic.  In fact, I would recommend this place as an option to those who would consider doing a wedding reception here.",3
2043,3 stars for front desk service. 4 stars for the skyline views. Otherwise it's your typical hotel.,3
2044,This place did exceed my expectations. Good location. Its a huge and upscale hotel yet affordable. Its much more impressive than other Holiday Inns and added perk of lots of shops in the same building. Well-dressed people everywhere. The skyscraper city aerial view is indeed breathtaking! The food in the hotel is also impressive and has a good organic selection.,5
2045,"I had my wedding here and it was AMAZING! Everything from the moment I viewed the space through writing the last check was a fantastic experience. Barbara Martin is incredible. She is so calm, professional, attentive, and relaxed me whenever I spoke with her. The food is great, and the view from the ballroom takes your breath away! I had a 5:00 November wedding ceremony and reception here and everyone could not stop talking about how fabulous it was. I was so happy I decided to get married here. The Cityscape bar is great, great views too. You can go straight to the merchandise mart and never go outside, which is great for elderly guests and also makes for great pictures. AND the Bridal Suite is soooooo cool. It's two stories and has spiral staircase. I felt so special all weekend. I can't gush enough about how fantastic, incredible, and special my wedding weekend here was! You will not regret working with Barbara and the Holiday Inn for your event!",5
2046,"This was my home for the past 2 weeks.  Luckily it was on my companies bill, because I almost went pee pee in my pants when I woke up and found the bill slipped in underneath the door. $2,124.36!!!!!!!!  Ooochee mama... and that's with NO room service, a little dry cleaning, and watching 1 movie. WOW. The Holiday Inn itself is okay, I utilized the pool a little bit, and the view from my room was just AWESOME.  (check out my photos!!!) It's connected to the Merchandise Mart (aka Chicago's World Trade Center) which is convenient since that's where my offices are. It's walking distance to just about EVERYTHING. I really did enjoy the area and the stay.  As for the hotel itself, it's about average... but the location and view makes it a prime spot. One other useful bit of information.  They have free wireless, but if the hotel is full... it got rather useless early evenings.",4
2047,"This is a weird place.  First of all, you walk into what looks to be an office lobby and wander around until you figure out that you have to take an elevator up eight floors to the real hotel lobby.  But once you leave the cold, sterile feel of the office building-ish entrance and standard elevator car, be prepared to be transported to the warm, exotic environment of....florida.  Yes people, this is a Holiday Inn, so you will be surrounded by shades of pink, purple, and turquoise, and other colors and patterns that only a guy wearing a straw hat, hawaiian shirt, black socks, and sandles could love.  Despite its really cool location, this is a holiday inn and feels old and worn down throughout its interior.  Not going into details, but not a good value for its price. I'm giving this one a slightly below average rating because on one hand its tucked into a nice spot on a bend of a river so if you just so happen to get a corner suite you can look down the river west and watch the trains go in and out of the Oglivie transportation center, or you could look north as the happy northsiders go about their business.  On the other side it remains a standard issue Holiday Inn. Pros: * nice location on the cusp of the loop * river views * set away from busy streets and no real low floors Cons: * outdated interior * ugly interior * holiday inn interior Bottom line is that there's a lot of potential here, but for the price they charge, it doesn't deliver.",2
2048,"Got a pretty decent deal on Priceline with ""name your own price"" at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza.  The location is fantastic: close to a variety of el trains, the loop, and other neighborhoods and shopping.  The views are beautiful and the bar is a great place to unwind as the sun sets and the city lights come on. However, I've had better experiences at other hotels.  Upon checking in, the front desk continuously tried to up sell me.  It would cost another $20/night to have a room on the outside, that had a view.  We declined, and got a nice room with absolutely no view in the interior corridor of the hotel.  They also claimed there were no rooms with king size beds unless we upgraded.  I'm not sure if they could see the price we paid, but if so, is there a certain price threshold that grants you access to the nicer rooms?  I'd be pretty upset if I paid close to regular price on priceline but still had to pay another $20/night for a nice view. But if you won't be hanging out in your room much, this hotel may be a good bet.  The fitness center and pool were pretty large and were open from 6AM - 11PM.  The bar had a happy hour which included a complimentary buffet of jalapeno poppers, wings and a crudite platter.  The bartenders were friendly and made some excellent cocktails.   The only other minus was since this is on top of a convention center, it is somewhat hard to get to.  You enter the doors, go down a hall, take an elevator to the 9th floor, cross over to the other side of the lobby, and then take an elevator to your floor.  Not the most convenient entry.  Just break up the long trek with a drink at the bar, and it's worth it.",3
2049,"Wife and I had our Wedding here in November and the Holiday Inn staff were the greatest to work with.  Barbara Martin, their catering director, was the utmost professional and nicest person we could have wished to work with.  She was very attentive to us with all our needs, and always calm and collective in such a hectic, fast-paced industry.  We booked the Wolf Point Ballroom, on the 15th floor, which has a very nice view in the cocktail area, and the ballroom which has views towards the Sears Tower to the south and to the east towards the lake...both great views!  The food was above average when it comes to hotel wedding food.  You can't expect much since you know the food is sitting their in warmers ready to be served, but our Strip Steak and Chicken Picatta were both good and tasty with big portions.  We also had a vegetarian or vegan option which was liked by those who chose them. In summary, if looking for a reception place for your wedding with a great view, good food, and a wonderful person to work with, the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza is a great place to consider!",5
2050,"I found the Mart Plaza through http://hotelplanner.com. They were able to give me a very good rate for a block of 12 rooms at $129/room per night. Although we didn't have our wedding at the hotel, our guests were encouraged to stay here for the following reasons: 1. Great location for public transit, cabs or driving. (Parking is expensive at $34/night, but you do get in/out privileges.) 2. Great rate for Chicago. The city views (if you're lucky to not get a room overlooking the pool roof) are out of this world. Just stunning! 3. Great service. I worked directly with the sales office (thanks Diane and Charnita!) and they were able to accommodate some people that missed the reservation cut off. And they gave them the special rate as well. 4. Our room was huge! I had asked nicely about getting a comp room (being the bride and all, I thought I'd ask!) and was pleasantly surprised that we were given a suite! The room had a king size bed and a big sitting area with couch, coffee table and four lounge chairs (Rm 2048). The view was a northern view of the lake and the Hancock. Very, very nice! Only drawbacks: 1. The bar was packed on the Saturday night (I think there were 2 weddings going on in the hotel) and service was slower than molasses, but the view is awesome, so waiting wasn't that huge of a deal. 2. Having to go all the way down to the main building lobby to smoke. Yeah, I know, that's really not the hotel's fault and I really should just quit, but it is a pain in the ass when you're super anxious about your wedding day and having to wait on everyone else to be ready so you can get ready, etc. etc. 3. Room service prices were ridiculous. I recommend you go down to the deli in the main building lobby for breakfast! $4.25 got me an egg, bacon and cheese bagel sandwich and a cup of coffee. The same would have cost around $14 from the room service menu. Blah. Overall, I'd definitely say we enjoyed our stay at the Mart Plaza. Thanks to all the great people who made our day special!",4
2051,"I stayed here for five nights during a conference, and had a very pleasant time. The room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the skyline (19th floor). The wireless internet was sometimes slow, but I was able to do what I needed to do. Service at the front desk was helpful. I also enjoyed visiting Italiasia (the hotel restaurant) and the Skyline Bar. A few complaints -- the ""Business Center"" was tiny and charged per minute to use the computers, or per page for print/fax. And while restaurant prices for lunch and dinner were reasonable (including for room service), breakfast was insanely expensive. Thankfully, the food court at Merchandise Mart has a Dunkin Donuts and a Jamba Juice, so if you're willing to take a walk (all inside, through the corridor connecting the buildings on the second floor) you can get your coffee, bagel, and banana for less than $12. The location was great -- easy access to CTA and some restaurants, right on the lovely Riverwalk, and within a cheap cab ride of everywhere I wanted to go. I'd recommend it to others who are visiting Chicago who.",4
2052,"Five stars for the incredible views of Chicago and the river. Three stars for a very average Holiday Inn room with cheesy decor. Three stars for the food. Meh. Four stars from a location that, if need be, allows you to get off a plane at Midway and barely go outside to the winter air to go into the Merchandise Mart where you can look at faucets on your way to the Holiday Inn. Some people care about that. Did I say five stars for the view of the river?",3
2053,"Our room was lovely and the view was fantastic. Hotel concierge was suave and the staff was very nice, although at times a bit over-accommodating (they checked on us about three times in our room following check in). The bar has a great view as well but the restaurant Italiasia is not good at all, blah-don't go. (It was a reminder that there are far too many great places to eat in Chicago than to settle for the hotel restaurant). Friendly staff, clean room, great view, great location, good price.",4
2054,"The best part about our room was the view.  Other than that, it was a little run-down.  If I had been staying for pleasure rather than business I would definitely have complained and/or requested a different room, but I just didn't have the time to deal with it.   Although I'm pretty picky about cleanliness, I think even some basic things were ignored.  The light switch in the bathroom was COVERED in grime and a layer of dust on top.  The bathroom sink was an undermount, and there was a ring of mold around the entire sink under the lip of the sink.  Ew.  Toilet wasn't cleaned thoroughly.  Ew.  The towels seemed old, and scratchy.   We were across from a housekeeping/laundry room where there always seemed to be several employees hanging out talking LOUDLY to each another.  Although the sound-proofing between rooms seems good, the sound from the hallway travels directly through the door.  It was like they were actually in the room with us.  Really annoying. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were not, despite their ""pillow menu.""  It's been a couple weeks since my stay and I still have a crick in my neck.  I think the bedding was fairly new, but it already looked worn. Overall I don't know if I'd stay here again.  The tip-able staff was nice, but the front desk folks were pretty morose.  And despite the renovation, the rooms were still shabby, just with new TVs and a pillow menu.",2
2055,"We've used this hotel for the Chicago(ish) Tweetup 3 times now and they have bent over backwards to help make our stays more than pleasant! There always seems to be more than enough parking. There's convenient access to the brown line, taxis and the shops at the Mart. The rooms are clean and the views are spectacular. Even with conventions and weddings going on, my room has always been a quiet place where it was easy to fall asleep.",5
2056,"Very nice room, stayed here for a wedding I was in.  The staff did a great job putting on the wedding itself, and our room, while nothing remarkable, was clean and had enough space. The only real issue we had was with the parking.  Maybe we were just spaced out that day, but it took us about three passes before we figured out the right place to turn in to park.  The entrance seemed easy to miss. Then, to add to the annoyance, while we were going up the driveway the employee at the front entrance waved our car over to stop.  Then he told us that we couldn't park there, and that we should keep driving...in the direction we had been driving before he had waved us over to stop.  It was a remarkably confusing experience.",4
2057,"We just had our wedding here and it was awesome.  You are in awesome hands with Barbara.  We wouldn't change one thing about the wedding, how it was handled, how organized it was, etc.  It was perfect.  We had some complicated details and everything was set-up perfect.  The food was awesome, the cake got a ton of compliments, the views are incredible, the newly renovated rooms were nice. All in all, a great experience. Highly recommend Holiday Inn Mart Plaza for any event/wedding.",5
2058,"Decent place to stay in, but the views were fantastic. It was really nice to stay in and just enjoy the Chicago city view! At night, it was quite enchanting. Rooms were somewhat small which was expected, the restroom was even smaller. Cleaning service was good. Pools were always packed with kids and families (which wasnt a problem for us because we were always out anyways). But the restaurant in the Inn was super great. Food was very delicious, best steak I ever had. We had a great chef, that was why. Nice place. I would not mind booking here again.",4
2059,"I booked this hotel after alot of research for a weekend away with my 13 yr old daughter and a friend of hers. The hotel is very easy to find and has great views. Its clean and updated. Not alot of frills or bells and whistles which is fine. I didnt pay for that. I got free parking which was the deciding factor to booking with easy in and out anytime I wanted. The pool is very nice even if a little cold. Work out room was up to date and clean. Lobby restaurant and bar were just fine as well.  Great views from the bar if you are over 21.   No in room fridge or mini bar, but like I said I didnt pay for that and didnt need it.  Free wi fi. We had a great stay and would go back. Id recommend it to anyone.",4
2060,"this is my go-to chicago hotel.  stands head and shoulders above all other holiday inns i've ever stayed in. +1 for location.  atop the chicago sun-times building.  you can get to the merchandise mart L station without even having to go outside (useful in summer and winter).  from the hotel lobby, there's a back set of elevators that will take you to the 2nd floor.  walk straight through merchandise mart on the 2nd floor, you'll run right into the L station (brown line, one stop away from the loop) +1 for having some class.  seriously.  if nobody told you that it was a holiday inn, you'd have very few indications of such. +1 for clean rooms. +1 for brand new plumbing/hardware in my bathroom (21st floor). -1 for expensive parking ... but what else is new, chicago?  dump your car elsewhere and take the L to the hotel. +1 for friendly hotel staff. +1 for taking care of priority gold members.  voucher for 15% at the hotel restaurant, italiasia. +1 for good breakfast buffet at italiasia. +1 for cityscape bar.  overlooks the skyline from the 15th floor.  fantastic at night. +1 for the folks at the bar letting us come in and use the Wi-Fi for a few hours (without buying any food/drink). +1 for free Wi-Fi (with passcode obtained at check-in). +1 for banquet halls and meeting space. +1 for offering AAA discount rate. +1 for pool and fitness center.  nothing too special. i've stayed at this hotel perhaps 8 times now.  recommended, even if you're on a budget.  i'll return the next time i'm in the city.",4
2061,"Decent hotel, cool view. Beware if you book through Expedia! While we got a room super cheap, it was also next to the RIDICULOUSLY noisy service elevator. I cant tell you what it sounded like except I was dreaming there were dinosaurs and elephants in the room.",4
2062,"I always win this hotel when bidding online on Hotwire. It's a pleasent walk to Michiganavenue but I don't mind it. Parking is like 35 overnight. I have stayed here with my family and we liked the place. If you're lucky, you can get the BEST view of the city. It's usually my favorite part. I got my hair done at a salon at Merchandise Mart (which is a walk through the hotel building) so that was pretty cool. Then in the morning, you can walk through the building to get breakfast at Dunkin Donuts. But as far as the hotel, I liked my stay. It was comfortable. The bathroom is small, but the beds are nice. TV worked fine. What else can you ask for?",4
2063,"I had my wedding here on 5/14/11, and I was very pleased with the entire event.  From start to finish, Barbara Martin, the catering manager, was very easy to work with and very accommodating.  The view from the Wolf Point Ballroom is great.  It looks out over the river and makes this more than just another hotel ballroom.   Another nice surprise was that the food was amazing.  I don't tend to expect much of wedding food, but I must say that ours was delicious.  We chose chicken napoleon with roasted vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.   I had people telling me all night that they loved it.  The cake (from Alliance Bakery) was included in our package and that was great, too.  And I didn't have to do any coordinating.  The bakery dealt directly with Barbara.   The rooms that they blocked out for us were also very nice.  The rooms for both sets of parents were free, as was our bridal suite which was spectacular.  It was huge, had a nice view of the city, and there was free champagne and cookies waiting for us.  We, and our parents, also got free breakfast the next morning.   I definitely recommend having an event there.  We really wanted a downtown wedding and at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza we were able to get it without spending a crazy amount of money.",5
2064,"We was chillin at tha holidae innn.... Hell no. I guess if you wanted to smoke or whatever it would be a badass hotel to stay at. When I came here for my buddy's wedding, I booked a room through priceline.  They stuck me with a smoking room. Totally disgusting. The front desk lady said, ""on the bright side, we're giving you a really good room with a view."" The view was nice, but it was disgusting because the the smoke smell was suffocating. It smelled like a bar, and I think my clothes came out smelling like smoke too. I would rate the place higher if it wasn't for that.  I think they gave plenty of us nonsmokers in line smoking rooms.  I'm not sure if it was bc we used priceline or what. Usually most upscale hotels are nonsmoking anyway. Anyway, thank goodness it was only for one night.",2
2065,"I would come here again if only for the view - it was awesome. We were in an east facing room and got a great view of the right break of the river and the merch mart itself. At night all over the city had colored lights (but wisely turned them off somewhere around midnight) and it was just gorgeous. Great location too. It was a quick inside walk to the Purple and Brown lines, breakfast was a short ways away also, and it was a good central location to a lot of activities. The one issue we encountered was finding dinner - it seems to be a very business area so most restaurants close around 4pm so we had to cab it places (it was 10 degrees). If you are there in the summer and walk or just don't mind dropping $7-10 on a cab all the time then it's great. (I'm a city walker but the weather was a bit prohibitive) The pool was nice (once they got the heater working) and they had a well stocked gym and a nice sauna. The price was reasonable for an inner-city hotel. To my friends' delight we were there during a conference of teenage girls so they got to be dirty old men sitting in the lobby one night....I Yelped...",4
2066,"I agree with Allen M. I'd like to add that room service is fast, but the food is bland. they did not deliver the food on a tble so we had to eat on the bed and desk...ugh. No mayonase was delivered as asked or onions for the sandwich. All the food was clean and well made, but just tastless. The pizza was bad evenby kid standards (they eat anything). The pool was cold to me, but the kids seemed to enjoy it. I enjoyed the sauna. There is no whirlpool, ugh! Service was fine. The only special thing I can say about this place was the bar. View was excellent and they allowed the kids to sit and drink Shirley Temples. Must add that I left something in the room and it was returned. I should have been called when it was found, which is what happened at Disney when I left something. They actually called me and sent  the items to me. It ought to be standard to call when things are found.",3
2067,"The price is right and the hotel is fairly convenient. It is within walking distance to restaurants and shopping. There is also a bus stop right around the corner which is convenient if you will be heading a bit outside of downtown.  There is also an excellent view of the city from the hotel. However, if you are looking for a place that you'll be able to take advantage of the wireless Internet, this may not be right for you. I had plans to do some work while away on business, but unfortunately, the signal from my room was at one bar. It was very difficult to go on. If you do head down to the lobby area, you will find a Cyber Cafe with a much higher signal. For me, I wanted to be in the comforts and privacy of my room, so this did put a damper on my stay. Overall, it is a nice hotel for the price. The staff was friendly, the fitness center and pool areas were well maintained, and they were also open from 6am - 11pm, which is rather accommodating.",3
2068,"Typically you get a crappy room when you check-in after midnight but we somehow lucked out.  Yvonne checked us in and when she slided the room key over to us, she said that we were really going to enjoy the room.  That can be ominous coming from a complete stranger.  Hmm. If you can at all, request a river view.  Or room #1612.  It is a corner room that is more like a suite in terms of size.  The major attraction is the view of the Chicago River- you get both the east-west and the north-south branch, plus the gorgeous 333 Wacker Building across the water, the L trains, Merchandise Mart, boats and the many bridges.  The furnishings are ok, the bathroom not updated, but who cares when you get this much space and an amazing view! Can't comment on the food served here.  There are plenty of options close by (not so much for a sit-down breakfast) or you can get chain-restaurant food court next door in the Merchandise Mart.   Or hop on the L and get out of River North for a spell.",4
2069,"We couldn't have had a nicer time at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza. My husband, daughter, and I live in Chicago but stayed there for the weekend of our wedding anniversary just to be closer to the downtown attractions and play tourist in our own town. The staff was SO sweet and so very friendly. --As nice as any of the 4 star hotels I've stayed in. I just can't stress that enough. --Just lovely people. The rooms are nice, very clean, decently appointed but nothing too fancy. The indoor pool area was great, again very clean, lots of towels. Room service was super fast and accurate. The food in the on-site restaurant was delicious and served in a very upscale manner. It's close to everything, easy access to all sorts of transportation, beautiful views of the skyline if you're on the river side, big rooms, lots to do. I'd happily stay there again. We had a great time.",5
2070,"This place we got a great price on. The views from the hotel are AMAZING. The bar was also full glass with amazing views. The lobby and staff were nice and friendly, the hotel looked really nice. But once you got in your room it was definitely the typical renovated Holiday Inn type feel.",3
2071,"BED BUGS!!! DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  My fiance and I just tried to check into this hotel this past Saturday.  My fiance is a pest control technician, so we literally check EVERYWHERE we stay now for bed bugs.  By check, I mean strip down the bed, lift the mattress, lift the box spring, pillows, bed frame...EVERYTHING.  Thank god we lifted the box spring this time!  My fiance knew something was up because the box spring had a bed bug encasement sheet on it.  Once we lifted the box spring and took a flash light to the bottom, you literally could see about 10 bed bugs and the fecal matter!! We immediately called down to the front desk and explained what we found.  They tried to give us a room on the same floor and were very casual about the whole situation.  EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED!  We requested our money back and left the hotel immediately. You seriously cannot take any chances with these things.  Once you bring them home, it is very hard to get rid of.  I know sometimes hotels like to respond to these type of posts and explain that it actually was not bed bugs and that it was ants, or some other creature.  I TOOK A PICTURE WITH MY PHONE, so don't even try to deny this!!!",1
2072,"Dennis and I stayed here in the Summer of 06 during our stay of the GayGames. The hotel is located at a fantastic location right near Merchandise Mart, which is a HUGE building of grand architectural design, as well as most of Chicago. This hotel is over the Chicago SUN newspaper and has SUPER FANTASTIC VIEWS of the city, river, and we got a small glimpse of Lake Michigan as well. The hotel is attached to the Mart as well as small Mall which is convenient. It is centrally located to Michigan Ave for shopping the local MBTA (T, Tube, Metro, etc), and the the river tours. Not really that many gracious amenities here. No room service, no gym, and a boring evening after hours lobby. The View here is worth over a million dollars from every side. I like to face the river or the lake. Just spectacular.",4
2073,"I just booked my wedding here for the fall of this year in the Wolf Point Ballroom.  HOLY COW, best kept secret in Chicago if you are a bride on a budget but still want an urban downtown wedding.  Their per head prices are phenomenal and for the location, and all that is included, I am still in disbelief at the deal we got.  Our wedding is on a Friday and we received an awesome discount on top of everything else being amazing at this place.  check out their wedding packages on their website. The ballroom isn't your typical wedding hotel event space, which we TOTALLY did not want but this place is sweet! it has all glass windows surrounding 1/2 the room which face the west for a pretty sunset and the south looking at 333 wacker and the rest of the beautiful skyline....it's great, you get the benefits of having your reception at a hotel but don't have to have the ""ballroom"" vibe If you're wedding budget is around $20,000 just to cover your reception costs, check this place out for a 200 person wedding, because you can have an awesome downtown wedding for less than that which is really affordable!! I can't wait to write another review of how awesome this place is once the wedding actually happens.",5
2074,"I was in a wedding and the reception was here. The reception service and food was good. However while everyone loved the steak, they did not like the chicken. The cake was bad (dry, tasteless, even the frosting). I mention the latter because the hotel provides the cake. We had some room issues the first night, but the staff accommodated us and  slashed the first rate night in half. Thank you manager Ben! Room service food was great. Bath towels were scratchy. The views are beautiful. Get a drink at the bar, whether or not you are   staying at the hotel. Parking requires you to schlep up and down a steep stairwell. The location is out of the way, and the cabbies will rip you off.",3
2075,The room was clean and large! The bar was lovely! The view was amazing!,4
2076,"I had my wedding here two weeks ago and absolutely everything about the whole weekend was perfect. Barbara Martin is the wedding coordinator and was just amazing. She is organized, makes your feel very comfortable and confident, attentive and responsive. Everything a bride needs leading up to her wedding! Although my husband and I live in Chicago - almost all of our family friends do not, so almost all of our 115 guests were staying at the hotel. It was very easy to get a room block that could accommodate and everyone we spoke to since the wedding has nothing but amazing things to say about their experience, the rooms, service and of course - the views!! Mart Plaza starts on the 15th floor of the Chicago Suntimes building and looks out over the river and the Chicago skyline. They also give the bride/groom and the bride/groom's parents their room free the night of the wedding. This is on top of their VERY reasonably priced rooms for wedding blocks. In addition, my husband's parents are divorced and they gave both sets of parents the free night. The ceremony, cocktail reception, and move into the reception was swift and flawless. The food was delicious. I really feel this venue provides a huge amount of value for your money. I highly, highly recommend the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza for your wedding!!",5
2077,This place is at the tail end of a two year renovation and is now swanky and nice. The location is impossibly good... I disagree with a review that states you are deserted here. You can walk 5-10 blocks to anything you could possibly want to eat. You are a 10-15 ride to Wrigley. Location is super!  The service is a slight step up for an HI as well. And the cityscape views are in every room on every floor.,4
2078,"My husband and I are were looking for an economical place to stay in a great location. This hotel fit the bill. I'll have to say that the view was wonderful and for the price we paid through http://priceline.com, really a steal. The rooms are a tad dated, but again for the price, you can't beat it. The bedding and pillows were comfortable. The hotel needs to overhaul the 80's wallpaper and get fresh, fluffy towels for the bathrooms to compete with other business downtown.  We will both stay again as it's centrally located and priced so well.",3
2079,The bar on the 15h floor has one of the most underrated views in the city.  I'd never even heard of it until we had a work function there.  Check out the pictures of this plcae for the south facing view down the Chicago River.,4
2080,"Spent 5 days in this hotel and loved it. They did an excellent job catering my son's wedding reception, in their lovely reception room overlooking the downtown and river. The staff were always polite and helpful. The location was excellent and convenient to downtown. Room prices, for the wedding guests, were very reasonable. Many rooms have been re-done nicely. Some still need fixing up. Ask for one of the new ones. If you're doing a downtown wedding in Chicago, look into this place!",4
2081,"The Holiday Inn Mart Plaza is stashed in the upper floors of the Apparel Center, west of the Merchandise Mart. It is a decent hotel, and most of its clientele comes for the trade shows at the Mart. Check in on the 15th floor, and the rooms all are centralized around a courtyard over the lobby. The rooms are standard, with the corner rooms getting some more space. There are no ""low floor"" rooms here. The indoor pool can be very crowded, usually with kids.",4
2082,"Pros - Good view, very close to the blue line Merchandise Mart CTA stop, good service, clean, swanky, Bath and Body Shop coconut lime toiletries, firm beds, choice of soft or firm pillows.   Cons - High parking rates, deserted and far from most bars/attractions, rooms (although comfortable) are typical boring Holiday Inn rooms for the expensive price tag.",3
2083,"Can you believe we booked this hotel room for $81 on a Saturday night?!  I never knew a place like this existed in such a good location.  No complaints at all...friendly front desk service, very nice hotel, clean spacious room, good (but pricey) breakfast.  This is place is the exact opposite of the Holiday Inn in Peoria (see my review).  Can you believe it was cheaper too!!??  They even have a list of all the bars in the area at the concierge.  Gotta love Chicago.  If you have family or friends coming in, suggest this hotel....you can't beat it - especially for the price!",4
2084,"All of the staff who made my wedding day happen were wonderful! Barbara Martin, the onsite wedding coordinator, is extraordinary. She is the utmost professional, responded to all of our questions in a very timely and clear manner, and was there to make sure our rehearsal and ceremony went off as planned (with helpful suggestions for how the day should flow). The reservations staff shared updates about our room blocks in a timely manner when we requested updates. The catering staff was so attentive throughout the cocktail hour and the sit down meal.  All of our guests received the courses in a timely fashion, and the food was delicious. If you go for the mid-level wedding package, the steak for each guest is huge and very well prepared. At one point, my husband stepped away from the table during dinner, and a staff member took his plate to make sure it was warm when he returned. Thank you to everyone! These are among the reasons we choose the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza as our ceremony and reception location: - Barbara Martin is great. - Affordable with lots of perks including comped rooms and parking for us and our parents the night of the wedding along with free breakfast the following morning. - The LaSalle room was just the right size for our 100 guests (plus dance floor) and the view of the Chicago is great (and makes any decisions about decorating or coming up with a theme so easy -- Theme: Chicago, Decorations: Look out the window). - Close to public transit for our out-of-town and city-residing guests. - Reduced parking rates were available to our driving guests. - We were able to have a block of rooms for Friday and Saturday night available to our guests at a reduced cost without having to make a financial guarantee that we would fill the rooms.",5
2085,"I was impressed with the view and the room.  The wireless internet signal is weak in some places, but I eventually got it working (it could be better).  There is a nice lounge/bar  in the hotel, and it's within walking distance of several shops and places to eat.  It's easy to get to a train from the Merchandise Mart by way of the hotel.",4
2086,I stayed here and realy enjoyed my stay. The rooms are nice and very clean. They have a really nice bar with a great view.,4
2087,"I attended a banquet dinner here and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Easily, one of the better banquet meals I've had in a while.  I tend to steer clear of chicken in fear of having to consume dry tasteless chicken but it was seasoned well and juicy.  The vegetables were fantastic as was the chocolate cheesecake with raspberries.  I would highly recommend hosting an event here.  From what I heard from the host, they were easy to work with and were extremely accommodating.",4
2088,"My review is specifically about the 17th floor rooms. I think all the other floors have been remodeled and the rooms are probably decent. But if you're lucky enough to get a 17th floor room like I did, you will be sorely disappointed. These are probably the ugliest, most outdated rooms (and bathrooms) in Chicago that still cost $170 a night. What a complete ripoff - not what you expect when you see the modern lobby. The front desk experience was unfriendly, and the hotel internet is horrid. Don't even think about VPN - you'd be lucky to have 2 webpages load up simultaneously on your browser. Not even the incredible river view is enough to save this whole experience. Hilton Honors - please take me back.",2
2089,Family came for a birthday and stayed here. Nice rooms that we got a good deal on via a hookup. All amenities were present and the staff we very professional.,4
2090,Stayed here on business.  Got a corner room with a fantastic view.  Lots of space and a small fridge in the corner.  The coffee maker was fine. The bathroom was a little old in appearance but everything worked fine.  The room was likely dated but these things don't bother me if I can get a good night's sleep.  Noise from below was at a minimum but this might be that I was facing the river.  Location is great with the metro just outside the place.  You can walk through the attached buildings and not go outside. Didn't try the bar but it did look like a nice view.  The hotel was going through some renovation but that didn't seem to affect anything.   The staff was friendly and helped pick some places to eat that night.,4
2091,So much fun to stay here. Fantastic location and good size room. The view from the bar at night is a must see. Room service was pretty good.,4
2092,"We checked in with a snobby guy at the desk who gave us a terrible room. We went back down, talked to another person who was very helpful and ended up with a great room. There is a cool bar on the upper floors with a nice view. There is convenient access to the metro.",5
2093,"We've stayed there twice and suggested to several people.  Good location and good price.  The bad part is you have to ride from the lobby to the 15th floor just to get to the hotel lobby and then you ride another to your room floor.  I did enjoy the bar.  The view is great, the drinks were good and Aaron was an awesome bartender!",5
2094,Took my brother on vacation recently to Chicago. stayed 3 nights. Nice hotel on the river. Our room had a good view. Convenient to places to eat and shop in Mart Plaza. Taxis always available outside. They lose a star for charging so much for parking. I don't care if they all do it. It's BS,4
2095,"I attended a wedding here last weekend, and had a blast!  I'm sure the actual site had little to do with the fun, but the bartenders were happy to keep the beverages flowing!  The food was some of the best ""wedding food"" I've had!  I highly recommend this site if you're looking for a place to host an event.  I'm guessing it's expensive, but since I didn't foot the bill, I have no idea.  :)",5
2096,"I have to be honest -- when I told a colleague I was staying here, she said, ""really?  I'm sure there are other hotels in the area that are nicer.""  I stayed with it, and really enjoyed it.  They must've done renovations recently, because the place looks great -- the rooms are terrific, the lobby is gorgeous -- great views, and more.  The staff was outstanding -- very helpful concierge.  One tip:  Try not to get a room that surrounds the atrium -- it was a bit noisy with the bar and restaurant just below, although keeping the fan on drowned that out.  But a bit off and you'll be happy as a clam here!",4
2097,"It has been around for over 30 years.....who knew?!?!   The recent renovation was well done.  Modern look in good taste and the views from the event space on the 15th floor are spectacular.  Cuisine is very good.  Extra stars for the event staff.  They are the most courteous and helpful we have experienced in 20 years working in the industry.   (They even cover parking for wedding/event vendors!!! No other place I know does this! Big kudos for that.).  Forget the ""Holiday Inn"" brand you may be familiar with....as most have said this location is a delightful surprise.  The 15th floor space is great for smaller weddings, but I think the space can be modified for different numbers of guests.",5
2098,"I stayed here for 4 nights, and it was great. Beautiful views of the city from all around the hotel. The location was perfect for downtown: close to everything, but far enough that the price was right. The conceige was so helpful and had great tips on restaurants. I ate in the bar one night and though it was hotel-priced, the shrimp and scallop ceviche was well worth it. Overall, the hotel, staff, room and location fit just what I needed for a 4 day weekend trip to Chicago.",4
2099,My room had the awesome view being that the hotel is so high up. I think all the room has a view of the downtown chicago! Rock baby!,5
2100,"When you stay at the Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Ave in Chicago, you get exceptional service from the minute you check in. The rooms are super clean and the plush beds are so comfortable you'll want to order breakfast in bed.   But don't!  The breakfast buffet is SO amazing (some rooms include it, complimentary, so ask at check in) you will want to enjoy everything on the buffet...and you won't be needing food until dinner (if even then) once you've finished! I want to expound on this a bit because this awesome breakfast buffet is a good enough reason alone to stay here (but the other amenities are superior, too!).   The $28.00 price tag is COMPLETELY WORTH IT!  Remember, you will likely NOT need another meal that day.   Not only does this buffet have  the traditional fresh omelets and Belgian waffles to order,  but it had TWO different types of smoked salmon (complete with condiments- capers/onions/cream cheese, etc); an array of fresh bagels/breads/muffins, etc; a fresh assortment of fruits, brie and other delicious ($$) cheeses; amazing ""Crab-cakes Benedict""; bacon, sausage (YUM!) and scrambled eggs that were so creamy, it left me wanting to speak with the chef about how he did that en masse!   I'm so impressed with this buffet (can you tell??)!  I have traveled the world and eaten at countless fine restaurants and I would be hard pressed to find a breakfast buffet that compares to this one.  ...perhaps the Auberge St. Antoinne in Quebec, but I digress.   The point is, this hotel (and breakfast buffet) is WORLD CLASS, as is the staff who work there.  Michael Jordan's Bar (in the hotel) has amazing burgers and macaroni & cheese and the hotel itself is something to behold, from the indoor coliseum-like pool area (which you can order drinks to) :) to the Grand Ballroom that houses the largest (12,000 lb) Baccarat crystal chandelier in North America.   All of this equals something to behold in this remarkable hotel.   OH!  And it's entrance opens up onto Michigan Avenue in Chicago...enough said!! Just stay there!!  You WON'T be disappointed!",5
2101,"I never thought I'd give Intercontinental a 3 star but here we are... I love the Intercontinental brand, you know what you're getting every time you come here and most importantly the beds are damn comfortable.   If I had to compare this to other Intercontinental's (not other hotels) I'd say the single ice machine on the 7th floor sucks!  Paying to use the gym sucks!  The room is much smaller than other Intercontinental's I've stayed at and the walls are pretty thin. The pluses include a Starbucks downstairs and jumping on their wifi is simple, the staff are helpful, the concierge makes solid recommendations especially when you want non tourist things, the hotel is beautiful and did I mention the beds are damn comfortable?  I think my favourite thing about this hotel is the location.  I'm glad we chose this one but the next time I'm in Chicago I might check out The James. To the couple having sex in the next room...guy, that was a poor showing...really poor!",3
2102,"Lovely historical hotel. I enjoyed its location the most - right on Michigan Ave. in the heart of the bustling traffic! Oh yes, this is the city for sure. But I loved every bit of it. I also thought that the rooms were pretty comfortable, as I stayed with two of my family members. The hotel employees pretty much helped out but mostly minded their own business which is a nice gesture, as some of us want to relax after a long day out sightseeing/or shopping. Our huge fam frequented the ""Michael Jordan"" lounge too, as it was conveniently located right next to the lobby. In addition to that, during the mornings, we would also load up on coffee at the Starbucks that is attached to the hotel. Enjoyed my stay and would love to come back again; maybe I'll take my significant other next time! There is a possibility that we may come back sooner than later. :)",4
2103,"I recently made the best discovery since Columbus: to stay at a hotel on North (and specifically North) Michigan Ave, you'd have to pay an arm and a leg, or maybe all four of them. If it weren't for consistently stalking internet deals, I'd be staying all the way in the South Side. Here's the thing about my hotel standards: don't care about fanciness, just be clean, roach/rat-free so I don't have nightmares and most of all, proximity. Intercontinental was quite accessible (as in walking distance) to the main attractions in Chicago, was clean and not as fancy as I had imagine it would be. I checked in early since I had an early flight arrival and was told I would be given a call/message when a room is available. Maybe I misinterpreted their implications by giving a call before the 3:00 p.m. usual check-in hour. When the clock hit 3:25, there was still no call but an immediate room when I stormed down there. I was placed in a room in the Main Building, with the whole Historical Building blocking my view of the Chicago River, not that I care too much  about it since I was barely in my room. Turn-off #2: No shower caps or slippers. I've been to cheaper hotels and they would provide them if you ask. Even after calling the front desk, which directed me to some other irrelevant service that made a ""note"", I never got my shower cap. Turn-off #3: Housekeeping. While the ladies do work hard to keep the room nice and tidy, their impatience really annoys me. I would get knocks on my door at 8 a.m. - 9 a.m. every morning, asking if we were ready. No, I am in the middle of my five-hour nap and I'm on vacation, so I will not wake up as if I'm going to work. The fridge was a bit of a problem, seeing I could only fit things up to the size of 2 cans. Only buy small things you know you can fit up to or if you want to do it like I did, place everything on top. Or go all the way down to the 7th floor to grab ice. The ice room is pretty disgusting with the dirty dishes lying around. I've read so many complaints about the paid wi-fi prior to booking, but here's a trick and pay attention carefully: take your laptop, iPad, ipaq by the Starbucks downstairs, connect to the wifi and toy around with it for a few minutes and it will last you throughout the whole night and morning in your room! Not bad, eh? The staff here are very nice and the place is very clean. The staff at the front door are especially friendly and kind. This hotel isn't too bad, especially for the perfect location.",3
2104,"Hmmm, didn't get any of the same perks from my first visit, wonder if we downgraded our corp perks.  This visit I was in the newer tower and had a great view of the Hancock building.  My wireless was super spotty and I was ready to dislike the place when the front desk removed the charges. All in all, clean, comfy, safe and convenient.",3
2105,"Not good. First room had a broken shower. Second room had a funny smell that never did go away. Walls are paper thin and we were awoken each night by about 12 giggling party people coming in at 3am and continuing the par-tay in the room next door. At one point I could hear someone coughing through the walls. That's right--just a cough. So you can imagine that 12 drunk people effectively shut down any more sleep, even after we called security. The rooms are in severe need of a refresh--dusty and dated. Not charmingly dated--more like udpated sometime in the mid 90s and in desperate need of a facelift. These stars are for the location, which is fantastic, and the lobby, which all marble and really pretty. This hotel is expensive for what you get and next time we're going to stay somewhere more modern.",2
2106,"The nickel-and-dime jackassing over the fitness center and mini-bar... not cool. - I had never been asked to pay to use the fitness center in any hotel, ever. - Any device in the room should be there to serve me.  There was no space to put a single item in the fridge.  The spring-loaded charge detonators attached to every item in the fridge was disturbing.  I had nightmares about whether I would be charged arbitrary amounts for having jiggled a can while trying to squeeze a cucumber into the fridge.  Is it too much to ask that I have a place to keep something healthy to eat?  The front desk assured me there was space in the fridge for me to put something.  This was not a large cucumber.   Whatever MBA dreamt up these margins should be sentenced to hard labor because it adds no value whatsoever.  My employer puts me in a nice hotel so I can focus on my work, not so I can be shaken down.",2
2107,"We had a wonderful experience!    Our check-in time was 1:00 a.m. (late flight in to O'Hare) and check-in was a cinch!  When we arrived at our room, we learned that they upgraded us to a suite with two full bathrooms.  I had left a small note in the reservation that it was an anniversary trip and they impressed with the experience--beautiful room and cold champagne with strawberries & champagne & chocolate.   The maid service was excellent and it was a quiet room with a peek a boo view of Michigan Avenue. They allowed us a late check-out of 2pm for no charge.  We left our luggage with the bellperson and it was secure and untampered with.  The only thing that wasn't over par was the time it took to pull the bags from storage--it was a little disorganized.  Otherwise, it was a wonderful experience and I recommend it.",5
2108,"When I got there, I found I had to share a room with a stranger (my co-worker I hadn't met).  The company asked for a double bed room not single.  When I went to the front desk the guy seemed uninterested in what I was telling him and got smart with me.  Then, told me he couldn't help me ""sorry, we are sold out."" They were not sold out so he lied.  I had to get my manager involved for them to do anything for me.  Then, he had to get management involved. Finally, they put us in a double room. It was small but better than a small room with one bed. Be prepared to pay for forks and spoons when you get there.  I think they probably charge for everything but the forks and spoons are $5.74.  You could get a fast food meal with that or one of their drinks in the refrigerator. BTW, the frig is small and they load it with stuff you have to pay for.  So make sure when you take it out, you put it back.   If you have a long stay there, you won't be getting a microwave either, FYI. I tried not to bother the front desk much since they seemed to unfeeling; however, the bar people were great! I spend a lot of time at the restaurant and bar.   Their Starbucks in there are slow too, they made me late for my bus when all they had to do was heat up my egg sandwich.  Took them ten minutes and they knew I was waiting.  They didn't do anything but refund my money or my inconvenience.  Not sure if that has anything to do with the hotel but it is connected to the hotel.   I learned to go across the street after that which was not far from the bus stop.   Other than that the hotel was okay! Not the best but okay.",2
2109,"I loved this hotel. We arrive around 5am into Chicago so by the time we reached the hotel we were exhausted. The staff was really nice and welcoming. Our room was beautiful! We had great views and a clean, beautiful, large room! The staff was really nice all weekend and dealt with us crazy lollapalooza fans roaming around their nice hotel. The location is great too. Next to tons of shops and restaurants. Wifi is expensive so I suggest cruising down to the starbucks and using theirs for free.",5
2110,The rooms are lousy and outdated. The walls are thin and the rooms are small with very limited room for your luggage/clothes. The service is horrible. The staff is rude and on the arrogant side. The only positive is the location. But at the same time there are many other choices in the area. Enjoy Chicago! Its an absolutely gorgeous City.,1
2111,"Service is excellent! Prices are pretty darn great. Location can't be better! Facing Michigan avenue, it's a bit noisy. But, it's the city, so what are ya gunna do! I did a ""stay""cation so got a room. I'd recommend upgrading to a suite. (bigger, better view, upgrades = turndown service + fancy and abundant toiletries) Parking is free on Sundays (e.g. 12:01am Saturday ""night"") along Wacker and Michigan (south of the river) so get urself a room with your loved one, and chill in the city! (stay away from the $57 valet!! at least they have in-and-out privledges) Very cool touch screen thing in the room. Soft music was playing when I entered (scared me a little). And it gives you info about the hotel (not those dirty little books to tell you where ice is), as well as access to coupons, information about shows, call the concierge, weather, etc. Internet was $18/day-- wuh!! But free in the (busy) Starbucks in the lobby. It's also a very big and busy hotel, so we were always sharing the elevators and seeing people in the halls. Although we didn't hear anyone through our walls, luckily. The rooms were a big old-- but they weren't dirty. So, don't go expecting the Ritz Carlton room quality, but imho you do get Ritz Carlton level of service.",4
2112,"My husband booked spur of the moment on a Saturday to surprise me and our little boys.  He had heard about the great landmark of a pool and got it for a decent price, for a Saturday night on Michigan Ave.  Valet was $57/night.   Check in was efficient & the clerk friendly, however, she informed us that the pool was closed but that we were welcome to go across the street the the Marriott to use their pool.  Seeing as this was the first weekend in March, thank goodness the Marriott had showers and provided shampoo and dryers!  The room was a very basic, small hotel room with a small bathroom and a few wallpaper peel spots.  Days Inn quality, which is fine if that is what you are expecting.  (I don't expect this of ANY hotel on the Magnificent Mile, personally.)  I won't stay there again.",2
2113,"Great Location Outdated Design. I am an IHG fan and have stayed at several locations all with fabulous service and great design however, this location was a bit disappointing in terms of an interior design aspect. It felt a bit outdated from a design atheistic in addition to poor lighting.  This location can definitely use a renovation! The location, Magnificent Mile, is awesome; in the middle of all things Chicago! As far as future trips are concerned I'd more than likely book else where since I'm big on the comfort level and visual appeal of interior decor.",3
2114,STAY AWAY. Terrible terrible service. Have good location and think they can forget about service. What a shame. Don't let them ruin you're stay. Too many other fine locations. That's why they have the rating they do.,1
2115,"I recently stayed here for two nights for a conference and it was wonderful! You really can't beat the location which is right in the middle of everything (and across from the purple pig, which is good as well). The room was nicely sized and clean. I would definitely stay here again.",4
2116,Great location right on michigan avenue. Try to get a room on a higher floor so you can get a better view. Internet was super expensive so just tether to your phones internet. Sign up for priority club to have access to later checkouts (2pm),4
2117,"I've stayed at InterContinentals before (San Francisco, Boston), so I kind of knew what to expect from a luxe downtown hotel. This time I was in Chicago on business for one night. My co-worker and I saw the valet parking at the curb in front of the hotel but no one was there, so we opted to find the garage ourselves. That was tricky. It is located behind the building and underground. Take a right on E. Ohio Street, right on N. St, Clair, and then another right into the underground garage looking thing. The 505 Michigan Ave. parking will be on the left. Parking for one night was $57 (ouch!) but it was come and go as you please and was good until 5:00pm the following day. The employees at the front desk were friendly, as were the bellhops. We inquired about late check-out, and the latest they could offer us was 2:00pm if we signed up for their free rewards program. Eh, why not? I travel enough or work anyway. It's also good at Holiday Inn/Express, people. The room was nice (King bed). I really liked the soft music playing on the computer screen. It helped me sleep by drowning out some of the street noise. The pillows were nice and fluffy. I was really bummed that there was a fee to use the gym. I mean, I could understand the fee for wireless, parking, etc. But for the gym?? That made me sad. I love to work out and I wasn't about to pay almost $20 to use the gym for one day. Otherwise, the location can't be beat. Right near a lot of shopping and restaurants. You did A-OK, Intercontinental, Chicago.",3
2118,"A two night business stay was pleasant and I had everything I needed. Clean room with all appliances. Mini bar was very expensive ($9 for a small can of Heineken!), but that goes for most hotels now. The hotel 'navigation' computer display was completely useless as it kept crashing, so I unplugged it. I won't let that minor gripe spoil the 4 stars  rating though. Makes a great base for exploring Chicago.",4
2119,"We used priceline to stay here.  Only $80.00 dollars a night!  Great price, location, near shopping areas on Michigan and rooms were clean! I love the view where we stayed (over looked Michigan Ave.) and staff was friendly.   My only con is the gym area, that I had to pay $25.00 to work out.",4
2120,"Stayed here Christmas Eve and it was quite nice. The room had a lovely view of the river and the gorgeous architecture of Chicago. Nice big bed and good toiletries in the bathroom. Nothing stunning beyond recognition, but very nice. For a few bucks extra, breakfast was included. Big buffet (but the pancakes and French toast were cold).  Overall, nice. Not very nice: no free wi-fi in the room. What kind of nonsense is that?!",3
2121,"Centrally located on the Magnificent Mile, this historic building is a nice convenient option.  Rooms can vary, however.  Initially we were put up in the historic tower in a room that was fine but nothing spectactular.  (What was spectacular, was how the hotel allowed us to check in super early 7am upon an early flight arrival). Later in the day, we moved to our originally assigned room, which was considerably larger (especially the bathroom, which was quite nice with separate bath and tub). One of my friends had Ambassador status, which apparently ... doesn't hold much weight here (or at least is quite confusing in terms of what one can expect).  After repeated requests for water, they brought up one small bottle for four of us.  Pretty disappointing service in general.   Also, we couldn't check out the historic pool as it was being renovated while we were there.  The gym was small and unimpressive. We were here because of a wedding held at the hotel but not sure if this is a place we would be dying to return to in future visits. Internet is $17/day (unless you have Ambassador status).",3
2122,The InterContinental Hotel Chicago has a rich history as one of the city's great landmarks of Freemasonry because it used to be the Medinah Shriners Temple private athletic club at a time when Freemasonry was incredibly popular and the Shriners used to conduct incredible parades and pageantry throughout Chicago. This building is particularly interesting because the symbolic features are so prominently and beautifully displayed. As you walk up the grand staircase you will see very ornate columns and images from a time when the Near East represented all that was magical and mystic which glorious images of Crusaders and Moors. The pool is particularly worth viewing given the chance as are the upstairs ballrooms. Take your time viewing and enjoy the treasures you're guaranteed to discover!,4
2123,"I was expecting a 4.5 star experience; here's why it was a 3.0: 1. We stayed downtown overnight to treat the kids to a ""staycation"" with a pool.  We checked in, got to our room, and saw a note on our desk that the pool was closed indefinitely. Really?  They couldn't have put that on the website or told us when we checked in?  My husband complained and they took $80 off the room rate, which was nice, but we wanted the pool. 2. There was writing on the bathroom wall above the bathtub. In marker. Big letters. 3. The TV programming did not work and the issue was not resolved before we all fell asleep. 4. No moisturizer in the bathroom.  It's the little things...",3
2124,"My husband and I were SOOOO impressed with the entire InterContinental staff during our wedding in the Grand Ballroom on May 5, 2012.  The entire process was amazing, especially working with Budi Tanzil throughout all of the wedding planning.  We heard countless positive comments about the actual service during the wedding meal/reception!  The food was DELICIOUS.  The hotel was very accomodating to our guests, especially considering it was a particularly busy weekend downtown due to the restaurant show.  I am so happy we decided to have our ceremony and reception at the InterContinental and will forever have wonderful memories of the weekend.",5
2125,"The location of this hotel is great, but unfortunately that is the best thing it has going for it.   We booked through hotwire, where this is billed as a 4.5 star hotel.  It most definitely was not.  I would say it is more of a 3 or 3.5 star hotel.  Our room was acceptable, but certainly not what we were expecting for something that calls itself a 4.5 star hotel.  The was incredibly small, the furniture was worn-looking, and the walls seemed to be paper thin.     It was also annoying that they seem to try to squeeze as much money out of you as possible.  In particular, they charge about $13/day (or something like $17 for your whole stay) to use the fitness center, which seemed completely ridiculous to us.  (They also charge a lot for the internet,  but since we didn't use their internet, I can't comment as to the quality of that).   Use of the pool is free, and the pool is stunningly beautiful.  It is worth taking a look even if you are not going to swim.  Unfortunately, the morning I chose to use the pool, it was extremely crowded, and they only had one lane set up for lap swimming, so it was challenging to actually use the pool for exercise.  Also, there weren't any hotel employees to monitor the pool and I saw several people in the pool in street clothes.  I got out when I noticed the baby that had a regular diaper (not a swim diaper) on--yuck!   My biggest issue was that this hotel was just not what we expected.  Had we booked a 3 star hotel, it would have met our expectations   But since we were expecting something on the level of a 4.5 star hotel, we were disappointed.",3
2126,We were surprised that our room was available at 10 AM. That's always a plus. We did end up getting a wheel-chair accessible room and didn't realize this until I was taking a shower and water was everywhere. I tend to be pretty clutzy and if it weren't for my boyfriend coming in to hand me a razor I was more then likely going to fall on my ass. We went downstairs and spoke to the manager immediately and she ended up upgrading us to a suite with 2 bathrooms. Woohoo! If you're a girl needing your time to doll yourself up for luxe dinners and nights out - you would be ecstatic too! We also complained about the pool and the gym being an extra fee so she ended up giving us a 3 day pass to L.A. Fitness. The doorman and bellhop were really chatty and seemed to really care about providing great service. Minus the room mix-up I'd definitely stay at another Intercontinental hotel again.,4
2127,"Okay, unless you throw down a lot of money for a room, you really are treated like lower class.  Even my upgrade didn't net me a nicer room.  The hallway had scrapes and scratches on the paint and doors.  The carpets looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the building was built and the hallways and my room smelled like dust.   Granted they were remodeling the restaurant downstairs but still.....my allergies went nuts and I ended up leaving early because I couldn't stop sneezing.   Also, nickel and dime you do death because they list themselves as a luxury hotel.  Well, again, if you aren't throwing down some major cash on the best rooms you'll pay 15 bucks for access to the fitness facility and have to pay for internet access.  boo. Good notes, the bathrooms are beautiful.  The air conditioning works well. Will not stay here again.",1
2128,"I stayed here while my bf was on a business trip. It's centrally located, near to the train, the river, the sights, restaurants, shopping, etc. Walk outside, and downtown Chicago is right there for your enjoyment. I think I'd rate 3.5 stars if I could. I was really happy with the bed, because usually no matter how nice a hotel I stay in, I toss and turn all night long. I pretty much slept like a (semi-drunk) rock here, I am pleased to report. The room was very small, but fairly nice. I'd agree that it's not a four star hotel - more like 3. I dunno if I'd stay here again, but I don't really have anything bad to say about it. My room was free, however, and I don't think I'd pay more than $200/night for this place, if that. Maybe I'm cheap? It's been a while since I've paid for a hotel room in the US since my bf travels a lot for business... I like how they have a touch screen computer thingy in the room - that was pretty cool.",3
2129,"This hotel was immaculate. Beautiful room, quick check in and check out. Swimming pool (WOW) is amazing BRING YOUR SUIT! Great location, would stay here again.",5
2130,"Shockingly terrible.  I come to Chicago maybe once a month for business and typically have enjoyed the Trump.  This place was recommended by my travel people, as close to office, nice etc. What I encountered are rude staff, a tiny room with no amenities, $7 bottles of water, a weird touch screen and tiny TV.   There are no towel racks in bathroom.  Turn down service was nonexistent.  Internet is $17 a night, shouldn't that be free by now? The hotel is massive and there are no personal touches to make you feel more at home which are essential when traveling for work. Needless to say I will never stay here again and will recommend all my colleagues to avoid.",1
2131,"We stayed at the historic tower and I can definitely see why it is called historic. The pipes in that building are so old, every time I shower it sounded like something one of the pipes would burst any second. Also the air conditioner sucked, we had it on the lowest settings but the room would never get cold. Only pros about this place is the location.",3
2132,"Lovely, well-presented room. Small-ish but very nice bathroom (with a nice big counter!). Room was impeccably clean and everyone we interacted with was so kind and accommodating (especially the bell-men). The hotel was very quiet, even though our window overlooked Michigan Avenue. Beds were super comfortable. The only thing to complain about is the BS internet fee ($15 a DAY?!).. but that's all nice hotels these days. Perfect location; convenient to the lake shore path for runners :)",4
2133,"I am a career event planner and have been planning and operating events for over 13 years. The InterContinental Hotel Chicago is one of my absolute favorite venues. I operated a very high end, high profile event for my (then) employer, and it was executed to perfection. My bosses and attendees were thrilled with the event. The location cannot be beat. This hotel is the only one in the city with a street level lobby on Michigan Ave. The service is impeccable, and the facilities are gorgeous. I would give a full five stars, but some of the rooms in the new tower are a bit on the small side. If at all possible, try to stay in the historic tower. OH! and an insider tip! Be sure to ask the concierge about the self guided ipod tour of the property... it's an open secret that you will love to take advantage of. Another tip, if you need to catch a cab to take you south of the river, cross the street before you grab one. It will save you a few bucks over getting it from the hotel cab stand.",4
2134,"Is it possible to give a zero star? After emailing Priority Club about the issues I had during my stay, I got a bunch of automated messages saying how they care. I asked them one simple question, but they kept repeating the same automated answer. It is frustrating that they don't care enough about their guests to even take the time to read their complaint email. Save yourself and stay some place else. I have NEVER said anything like this to ANY other businesses, but the experience I had was just god-awful. Worst Hotel Experience ever, and this is supposed to be a 4-star hotel. There are many world-class hotels in Chicago. Why would you settle for something this bad? Don't just read this review. Go do some research and read other reviews on tripadvisor. You will see comments about how god-awful the service is and how small the rooms are.",1
2135,"Oh man.  I'm pretty torn on this one. So...beautiful hotel, accommodating staff.  Luxurious in an understated, traditional sort of way.  (Sometimes trendy is *too* trendy...see also: W Hotel Chicago!)  And I can dig quiet luxury.  Attention to detail.   Seriously, super nice staff.  (Bonus points for the day manager being from MKE and knowing my Riverwest neighborhood!) Here's the but.  You knew it was coming. BUT... Two strikes and you're down from your four stars to three.  Well, two and-a-half strikes, actually.  I really want to give the Intercontinental 4 stars...but I can't.  Here's why. Strike 1: First night, I return from dinner in the hopes of relaxation and a nice nightcap at ""Eno"" (the hotel's wine/chocolate/cheese spot).  After extensively perusing the insanely awesome wine list and getting my heart set on a particular glass, the girl behind the bar informs me that they'll be closing.  In 10 minutes.  So...""I can buy a bottle to take to my room...but...yeahhhh.""  (Don't want/need a bottle, so no Eno for me.  No.)  Seriously?  You're a hotel bar in downtown Chicago and you're closed by 9:30?  Hrm. Strike 2:  This morning, I wake up in the hopes of hitting the Fitness Center for an early (for me!) morning jog.  Exit elevator on the level labeled FC (fitness center). Woman behind counter:  ""Just looking around?"" Me:  ""Yeah.  I was just gonna get a quick work-out in."" Her:  ""Well, you're aware you have to pay, right?  16 bucks per day, or 20 to cover your usage for your entire stay.  Still want to work out?"" Me (confused, internal dialogue running wild, finally indignant):  ""I guess I'll just wait...?"" What?  I don't get it.  I just don't. Strike 2 and-a-half: I get back from a long day out and I'm seriously crashing from massive amounts of caffeine and all I want is to take my shoes off, and my room key doesn't work.  (Sigh.)  Truck downstairs, wait in line for the one front desk worker to be able to assist me.  Key re-activated, all is well, but still.  It was sort of the straw that broke this reviewer's back. Don't get me wrong.  This place is pretty dang swanky.  It's nice.  The people are nice.  But a few too many strikes and this lady's not so apt to give that extra star.  Just sayin'.",3
2136,"Great location, reputable name... but far too rundown of a hotel to be considered 4-star.  We've stayed here a few times (and on both occasions our needs were met for what we were looking for), but each time it just seems to be ""okay"".  Because of that, I would rate their Chicago property a generous 3 stars. On the other hand, I really wish I could review their international locations. The properties in the Middle East (Dubai Festival City, Abu Dhabi) are beyond 4-star service, facilities and amenities - definitely a well-deserved 4 stars.  I would rate the property in Dubai at nothing less than FIVE. But then again... the United Arab Emirates would surpass even the biggest critic's expectations! Overall a superb hotel branch to give and get points with.  We have been happy with InterContinental hotels for our go-to or last minute hotel needs, and their international properties are spot on.",4
2137,Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. For the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...I wouldn't consider it that good. The rooms were solid. The view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave.) The service was ok. The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. We came here for a Jewish/Hindi wedding. Appetizer was fine. Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. Dessert was inedible. I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. I personally preferred the Conrad. Better prices and better service.,2
2138,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Bliss. Do you know how to spell Bliss? Well I do. It's spelled I-N-T-E-R-C-O-N-T-I-N-E-N-T-A-L H-O-T-E-L. The Intercontinental Hotel provided as stop #2 on the engagement festivities surprise tour. We were upgraded to a suite in the Historical Tower, it's the only way to stay, with a generous bathroom and jacuzzi, his and hers robes and sweeping views of the Magnificent Mile from our windows. A long, dramatic hallway leads to a spacious suite, perfect for our getting ready for surprises #3 and #4 on the engagement tour, and for popping bottles of champagne in celebration. The staff was gracious and accommodating, and had I known where on earth I was going while I hastily packed my overnight bag, I would have thrown in a swimsuit to take advantage of the killer 1920's-inspired pool area, complete with lunching balconies and ornate blue tiling. (Think of Queen Sophie Ann's ""day room"" from True Blood). Starbucks is located on the first floor, and room service choices are elegant enough to be considered ordered on special occasions, such as an engagement : ) Five stars for making me feel like a soon-to-be blushing bride!",5
2139,"Went to Chicago and decided to try out the Intercontinental hotel in Chicago. We were updated to the Vice-Presidential Suite (nice!). The room was dated but impressive. The room was probably  setup 15 years ago, and had minimum maintenance since then. The floor tiling was clearly worn. The suite is on the 35th floor. The wind at that level can be severe and there was clear wind noise from the windows, to a level where we had to close the door to the bed-room to be able to fall asleep at night. Maybe time for an upgrade. The room has two bedrooms and a nice living room. No less than 3 restrooms, 2 showers, so quite nice. The beds are very comfortable. The daily internet rate is $19, which is a bit steep, for mediocre speed. The room has an internet terminal and there is wireless access through iBahn. The hotel elevators were good and well maintained. The lobby is attractive and the bell stand quite effective. The front desk was slow in processing but very courteous once they serviced us. There is a Starbucks just off the lobby. Nice! They have flight information available in the lobby, very convenient. The restaurant on the mezzanine level is OK but not great. Great place to stay if you want more of a historic visit to Chicago. Great location, but this is a hotel that has not seem much updates / maintenance since 1980. Some people like that style and others are allergic to it. At the price charged I am disappointed that we did not have free internet and the rooms are dated with noise, ...",3
2140,Dependable enough and really well located on Michigan Avenue.  But I do not understand why the InterCon chain - in general - charges a fee for it's fitness centers for people who aren't status members... Ridiculous!,4
2141,"Sorry - big name, good location, cool place. Service 100% absolutely sucks! Go somewhere else.",2
2142,"I used to have a pocket full of nickels and dimes before I stayed here and now they are all gone. They charge almost $50 for parking, $10 for Internet, $12 for the fitness center, and $7 for water. Seriously $7 for water! Obviously in order to stay here they expect you to show up with at least 25lbs of nickels and dimes. My favorite part of our stay here was the warning I encountered when I tried to put my own bottled water into the mini fridge, ""For the safety of you and your fellow guests, please do not put any additional items into the refrigerator."" We stayed up all night waiting for that thing to blow!",2
2143,"Name: Inter-continental. Wow. Travel without moving...Hot. Groupon: $99 for a night. Hot. Location: 505 N. Michigan. Hot. Date: February 13th-14th. Super mega hot. Floor: 9th. Meh. Warm.

2144,"I always love it when my business traveler friends come through Chicago and we set up a sleepover date at their hotel. Really, is there anything more strangely comforting than staying at a hotel in your own city? The Intercontinental is a fabulous find for right around $200 a night. Pillow-top beds (good sleep is the priority), well-appointed rooms, a super convenient location, and a luxe lobby. And the lobby bar is great fun! We stopped by around midnight on a Tuesday night and the bar was jumping. A black tie-clad group was in full effect and their drunken ringleader treated the entire bar to a round (or two) of shots! This morning, while helping my friend search for her crackberry, I found a used Trojan Magnum wrapper under the bed... details, housekeeping, details!",4
2145,"Instead of falling victim to an overpriced and underwhelming New Year's Eve ""Bar Party"" my boyfriend and I decided we would do it up nice and stay d-town in a hoighty-toighty hotel.  After much research, we settled on the Intercontinental because the price wasn't TOO outrageous and location was well, perfect.   First the bad.  Upon check-in at 3PM, my bf was presented with a ""contract"" promising he would not bring booze into our room. Um, OK.  Hopefully that was just a NYE thing because it was totally LAME (and I may have snucky some booze in anyway. Or not.  Shhh).   Also valet parking was 40 bones.  After the room price, that is a little steep but fair I guess for downtown 24-hour parking. As for the good, our room was very nice.  The bed was heavenly and I think I could live in it (I found refuge in those pillows as we painfully watched the Bears blow it.  Awesome we had planned our evening around that).  I also found the room to be really clean (but who really knows these days, especially after watching Dateline when they show those microscopic bugs - ew). Highlights included the bar - great people watching, especially that night because there was a wedding.  Drinks were pricey as expected but the staff was nice.  I did find a SHARD of glass in my martini before I was, oh about to swallow it (wouldn't that have been a Happy New Year?) but the bartender apologetically gave me a new one at no charge.   Shards aside, I had a good experience at the Intercontinental.  It's pretty solid and RIGHT on Michigan across from Nordstrom.  I would recommend that an out-of-towner shacks up here for a visit.",4
2146,"OMG can i live here? my mom was in town to see jersey boys and instead of staying at my small apartment, i got a room at the intercontinental for us! through hotwire, i got a room that regularly books for around $350 for $104. SCORE! it's an over the top hotel and very comfortable and accommodating. i HOPE that i will be able to go there again!",5
2147,"I enjoyed my one night stay here, but I have one question and one question only... WHAT IS UP WITH THE SHOWERS? Who designed this. If you haven't been it's a huge walk in with a curtain you draw. You could probably fit a good 7 people in that shower, which hey, could be fun, but I can't really see the Intercontinental being ""that"" kind of hotel. Anyway, here you are in this second room aka the shower and as you are going about your business you pull the curtain and walk back into the bathroom to find the entire floor soaked. How was this a good idea? First of all it's dangerous. Say you were drinking heavily in the hotel (not that I would know anything about that kind of behavior), but then say you took a shower and walked out to Lake Michigan Avenue on the slick marble floor. That just spells danger to me and a waste of towels since it took all but one of the supplied towels to mop it all up. Other than that, the room was HUGE and the views were great. i stayed in the historic tower and it was nice. Also the beds. WOW. I have trouble sleeping, but man o man, did I ever wake up with the best puffy eyed face and out of control bed head. In my world, that means I actually beat insomnia for one night and won! Other than those things it's just a nice hotel that I think a business traveler would enjoy. They do charge $9.95 a day for Internet which seems lame seeing as how you are already paying over $200 for the room, I mean come on, would it kill ya to comp that, but overall a fine place to rest your head. For a romantic romp however, I may stay somewhere else. Again, not that I would know anything about that ;)",4
2148,"Two words. Historic tower. Yes. If you are going to stay at the Intercontinental- you must stay in the historic tower. The Intercontinental Chicago is really two hotels in one. The historic tower was built in 1929 and was originally the Medinah Athletic Club. The ""north tower"" or main building was actually another hotel that was built in 1961 and was acquired by the Intercontinental and joined together. Thus the style differences between the two towers. While the historic tower costs more, in my opinion, it is worth the money. Look for deals (especially if you are staying over a weekend). My room rate was only $99 a night (had a Groupon for one night and found a deal for the other) This cheap rate got me a standard room in the main tower- but after a little dealing upon check in- I was able to get a corner room in the historic tower for a nominal upgrade fee. My room was lovely. A SE corner room with two windows- one looking over the river and one facing east with views of the lake and Navy Pier. Perfect for a getaway weekend. The staff at this hotel was on their game. Late night room service came within the promised 20 minutes. The valet brought my car around in 5 minutes, turn down service was followed up on, and the doorman was quick to take care of my every need. So why not a perfect score? I think they were a little cheap in some areas and as a frequent traveler, I expect alot. I'd rather pay a little more for the room and not be ""nickel and dimed"" to death throughout my stay. For example- they charged $17.95 a day for wi-fi, there were no high end toiletries in the bathroom, they were missing some expected amenities (complimentary water in bottles, q-tips, shower cap and cotton balls) . Even the business center charged for wi-fi- crazy! And the worst thing? Overnight parking in the hotel cost $53 a night. That's highway robbery and the same price is given for the public as those staying in the hotel. My advice? Drop your bags off with the bellman and then park around the corner in one of the cheaper lots. All in all, the Intercontinental is a great hotel and the location can't be beat. Just know before you go that it's the little things that are going to add up during your stay so plan accordingly.",4
2149,"The Intercontinental Chicago needs a lesson in Feng Shui. The room with double beds was small (not surprising considering it is a hotel in the city). Unfortunately the trick of using mirrors to expand a room was used ineffectively. Right next to the bed was very large mirror that took up practically the whole wall. I swear I didn't sleep well because of that. The only thing that the mirror accomplished was to highlight the circus like drapes of the room. I happened to like the whimsical decor but I didn't like having bad dreams. Unlike the mirrors in the bedroom, the Intercontinental is in an excellent location. It's right on Michigan Avenue and if you're into shopping then you're in luck. Bloomingdale's, Saks and American Girl are right next door. If you need to ride the L train it is also not too far away. The hotel has a fabulous pool fit for royalty. It's olympic sized and surrounded by Spanish tiles. The only thing missing was a poolboy who'll fan you and feed you grapes. Sadly, I was not able to spend some time poolside or in the water. The Intercontinental is a decent hotel to stay in. It's a reputable chain on the higher class end. The Chicago location, however, is slightly underwhelming.",3
2150,"God help me if my Irish Catholic mother ever reads this review because of what it implies, but here goes.... I used to have 2 roommates and a boyfriend. So when Valentine's day rolled around, I decided that a better way to spend it was to NOT stay home on the couch watching tv with my boyfriend AND 2 roommates.... So I booked us a room here for a romantic Valentine's mini-getaway!! Service at the hotel was very courteous and prompt, from check-in to check-out. From reading the other reviews, I'm guessing that the hotel has different rooms in different sections. Well our room was gorgeous, a high floor, no street noise and a kickass view of Michigan Ave. The bathroom was large with marble countertops and shower/bath, but most importantly it was clean! The Intercontinental is located right a decent section of Michigan Ave with lots of good restaurant options in the near proximity. As a result of that, we definitely did not eat at the hotel or order room service. We tried to have a nice romantic walk down Michigan at night, but February in Chicago = COLD!!!! So we went back to the hotel and went swimming. The pool area was really nice and WARM. I'm willing to bet that they have one of the nicest hotel pools anywhere in Chicago. Note to parents: it doesn't seem kid-friendly, the minimum depth at the pool was like 7 feet. All in all, we had a wonderful, relaxing and romantic time staying here, and I got a beautiful diamond necklace from the boyfriend as a gift. So what can I say?? That's worth at least 4 stars in my book! Oh yeah, and Mom??? If you're reading this... our room had 2 king-sized beds. ;)",4
2151,I stayed here 1/1/11 to 1/2/11 : My mini vacation in Chicago. My room was beautiful. King size bed on the 18th floor overlooking Michigan Ave. I slept like a baby here. The decore of the room was beautiful. Awesome bathroom shower with hot water and excellent pressure. Make sure you check out their pool and sauna. Their pool is on the 13 or 14th floor (FC) and has a very unique 20s look. Wooden sauna is great! Staff is extremely nice. If you are still planing to visit the museum or go to lunch after your checkout I recommend taking advantage of their complementary luggage hold at the bell stand. Also enjoy the charming lobby with stunning lion statues and comfy chairs.,5
2152,"The best characteristic about this hotel is it's location.  It also has beautiful classic architecture, and the hotel lobby is lovely.  It's funny... I can always distinguish Kimpton hotels from the decor.  Very eclectic and modern, but still has that institutional feel to it.  I think it's a good value for the money, and wold recommend it to visiting friends and tourists.   The bathroom was pretty decent in size... I'm all about nice bathrooms!",4
2153,"For what we paid, I'm a fan (MAJOR haircut with P----line). Tiny room (again, see above and also an older property), but very nice - the couch against the windows (which open!) was a neat touch.  Great view of the lake that really made it special. Down side(s): the light blocking shades...didn't. Bed was a little uncomfortable. Internet situation just irks me; if I didn't have my handy dandy aircard, I'd be torqued. Food was okay though it was a United Nations-esque exercise to explain what ""Please send me hot chocolate with Kahlua"" meant. Positives: front staff trained well; they were a pleasure. Massive Starbucks in the lobby - a good launching pad. Location, location, location - we were right in the middle of everything. Neat building.",4
2154,"***3.5 Stars*** Ok, maybe it's just me, but when I stay at a hotel with the reputation of the Intercontinental (and the price tag), I expect something special.  This hotel is really quite ordinary.  I stayed here recently for a conference and while the meeting amenities were fantastic, the hotel room itself was only mediocre at best. So, let's start with the mediocre first.  My hotel room was spacious, located in the historic tower  (I guess that's why it seemed that my room hadn't been updated in a very long time).  The bed was not comfortable and the lounge chairs were old and worn.  The rest of the furnishings were old and very used to the point of having drawer fronts askew on the desk and doors that wouldn't open properly on the TV stand.  Like I said, with a hotel of this reputation and price, I expect a comfy bed, some chairs that don't look like they've been around since 1964 and furniture that isn't out of grandma's attic. Then, there's the bathroom.  It's like they may have tried to update it at one point...and then gave up.  I had an impossible time maintaining one water temperature both in my sink and in the shower.  Imagine trading between scalding hot and lukewarm.  Gee, I'm now awake AND I've sustained 3rd degree burns.  AWESOME!  The towels were crustier than sand paper and, come on people, can we please have two-ply toilet paper??  Single ply is what I expect from your much cheaper cousin, the Holiday Inn. The redemption in the hotel room was the large, flat screen TV.  That I did enjoy (along with my $6 bottle of water). Now on to the good stuff...The meeting facilities.  These were simply wonderful.  The staff was courteous and friendly.  They accommodated all of my vegetarian meal requests without blinking an eye.  The breakfast buffet was a breakfast lover's dream - everything imaginable and all of it very tasty.  The banquet lunches were quite good and all the meat eaters enjoyed their entrees.  The rooms where we had our meetings were well maintained and very clean.  Temperature was nicely maintained as well.  I would highly recommend their meetings services and facilities.   Of course, in the end, you're paying for the location.  Yeah, that can't be beat.  It's within walking distance of just about everything the Mag Mile has to offer - great restaurants, bars, shopping...",3
2155,"I enjoyed my stay at the InterContinental, which is where my work chose to host a huge meeting. Pros: - Modern, comfy King bed with 5 large, plush pillows - Decent 2-story fitness center; more extensive than other fitness centers I have been too -Downtown location; perfect for people who want to be blocks away from major shopping and running along the river Cons: - Water problems with my shower- my water would go in and out - It's REALLY big- two different ""towers"" and it can be a little overwhelming for people who just want to have a relaxing stay in Chicago - The ongoing drilling that occur ed during our meeting; completely unprofessional and disturbing (we should have been warned) Overall, it's a decent venue to hold a work event at, however, I would not recommend the InterContinental for a personal stay in Chicago (go to the Affinia!).",3
2156,"Yes, it's an Intercontinental, but not quite as nice as other Intercontinentals I've stayed in.  In fact, there were a couple major flaws: (1)  The rooms are NOT soundproof.  At all.  Like I could hear the conversation in the next room.  I could hear people walking around in the hall and doors slamming.  Not great. (2)  The curtains are not lightproof.  Both curtains were drawn and I still awoke from all the light coming into the room at 6am (we were facing east so...). (3)  Crappy towels and no bathrobes. (4)  Comfy bed, but kind of scratchy sheets. (5)  Fancy looking bath products but I didn't really like them. HOWEVER...the location really can't be beat.  Right on Michigan Avenue.  About two blocks from the river.  A ~10 minute walk to most train lines. Also to note:  Breakfast at the hotel is $23 for a buffet.  Not unexpected, but breakfast isn't usually a meal I like to splurge on.  You can order a la carte, but be aware that juice and coffee (which are included with the buffet) are ~$4 EACH.  Breakfast entrees are in the $8-13 range so maybe you DO just want to get the buffet...   I did really like the wine/cheese/chocolate bar located off the lobby.  It was pricey, but very enjoyable.   We hotwire-d the room and I think total (with taxes and everything) it was about $125/night (and actually the next to cheapest hotel we found in the Loop area).  This is a place I would stay again if the price was right, but other than that, I didn't find anything fantastic about it.",3
2157,"This review is meant to serve as a warning: if you check in to the Intercontinental, and they try to give you a room on the 9th floor, historic tower, just turn around and leave. Now, the qualification: We checked in to the Intercontinental because our friend was having her wedding there, and  we didn't want to have to drive back home after a late night drinking. Plus, I've always wanted to stay there. First bad thing: the front desk gentleman was very pushy about selling their ""Ambassador"" program for $150. I told him we were short on time and needed to be off in a hurry. He actually held our room key in the air out of our grasp while he continued to rattle on for five minutes about the Ambassador program and how he really thought it would be a good idea for us to go ahead and sign up so we'd get a free upgrade to a suite. We were three minutes late to the wedding and had to watch the procession from the rear. So, we put that behind us and enjoyed a nice reception in the Intercontinental ballroom. Nobody can say the hotel isn't beautiful inside. Going back to our room at 11:45 we noticed that the room's  windows overlooked a brick wall - the new tower next door. OK, so no view. I suppose that a view of Michigan avenue runs an extra $100 at least. Fair enough. But the other problem quickly became  apparent - rooms on the 9th floor have a ballroom directly below them. We were able to heard the band talking between numbers, as well as the loud, thumping music. And I mean it was loud. Not acceptable. After a little run-around trying to get a manager, we were offered $100 off. Nope. They couldn't tell us when the music would stop. Finally, begrudgingly they offered to refund our money and let us go home since there were absolutely no rooms available to move us to. (However, I bet if I forked over the $150 for the Ambassador program., a suite upgrade would have magically appeared...) So in the end we would up driving back home, tired and hung over. Shame on us for trying to go to sleep in peace at 11:45pm... Two stars because, come on, this is the Intercontinental Michigan Ave. They should have their shit together and not make me feel that I am some lousy peon who gets the third-class room in steerage because I don't have status. The only nice thing they did was refund the parking fee as well (a $53 charge, mind you), so free parking downtown isn't all bad...",2
2158,"Classy hotel. Standard room w/ 2 double beds. City view. 25th floor. Shopping to the left and right and everywhere in between. Just step outside! What made me fall in love? The historic POOL. I made it a point to buy a bikini before I arrived. It was mighty chilly outside and this Cali girl seriously hates being cold, but the indoor pool was marvelous!! Can't wait to come back!",5
2159,"I enjoyed a brief stay at the Intercontinental and I have to say that I was fairly impressed. From what I saw of the facilities, they are nice. Fairly well-kept if not a tad bit dated. My companion was laughing a little at the decor in the guestroom. It seemed inspired by Cirque du Soleil, oddly enough. I was NOT laughing at the view though! Straight down onto the Michigan Avenue bridge. Simply gorgeous!! They have an outstanding concierge desk. Maria went out of her way to assist me. I also appreciate that when I called at 6am for a toothbrush, it arrived within just a few minutes!",4
2160,"I stayed here for 3 nights this summer. First off, the hotel from the exterior is very impressive and the hotel is in a prime location right on Michigan Ave in walking distance to shopping and across the street from major bus lines.  Close to major sightseeing spots.  Overall, a prime location. According to a friend who came here for work, the meeting rooms are very fancy.  Except I wasn't here to use anything but the rooms and lobby. Apples to apples, for their 4+ star hotel rating it was an okay experience.  I was bumped to a suite which hey, I'm not gonna complain about!   Except a few things I found oddly sub-par - the picture quality and sound of the flat screen TV were very poor and the channel line up was very limited.  It was the shabbiest TV reception I've ever encountered at a hotel.  Even my 1 star hotel experience in Spain had better TV reception.  Each day I ended getting charged incorrectly by housekeeping for allegedly taking things out of the snack bar (which I did not).  The Ipod dock for my alarm clock did not work.  The Business Center which is contracted out to a third party, messed up my printing job and double charged me. Otherwise, the hotel is very impressive from the outside and opens up to a spacious and busy lobby when you walk in.  The decor is a little bland and old-fashioned but otherwise everything about my room comfortable and what you'd expect.   Some of the employees are polite and helpful, but not to any greater extent than what you'd encounter at Days Inn.  And some employees were brusque and not as helpful.  Overall, I thought the customer service was just meh. I would say this hotel was solid but I was not impressed.  I realized after my stay here that I am perfectly happy with a recently renovated room at 2 or 3 star non-boutique hotel with a younger, more modern decor.  Because that's usually where I stay as a budget savvy traveller.",3
2161,"Like others have said, this hotel has a great location and a great pool.  Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with the room itself. I came here on a family trip, where the parents got a single room with a king-sized bed, and my sister and I shared a room with two queen-sized beds.  Despite the fact that the two rooms were the same price, there was a huge disparity in the quality.  The single room was much, much nicer, from the view to the coffeemaker to the furniture.  The double room was not much nicer than what I would expect from a Holiday Inn.   I agree with the previous reviewer that the placement of the mirror was bizarre to the point of distraction.  It was on the wall right next to one of the beds.  Personally, I tend to make good use of hotel mirrors when getting ready in the morning, and it's usually near a desk or something.  This particular mirror was completely useless and only served to try and make the room look bigger.  I noted that the mirror was in a more logical spot in the single room. I think my main problem with my room was that they had the kind of toilets you have in public restrooms, with the metal handle that comes up rather than a toilet tank with a flush handle on the side.  It just felt cheap, and it was leaky, so we had to grab it with a towel to avoid getting sprayed with toilet water every time we flushed.  It just wasn't what I expected from the Intercontinental.  Also, I found it really annoying that you have to scan your room card just to open the minibar.  We wanted to keep our bottled water in there, but we were afraid of getting charged, so we just drank it at room temperature. On the plus side, all the staff were really nice.  As mentioned above, the pool is fantastic.  I went once in the evening and again in the morning, and I had to share a lane both times, but it wasn't overly crowded.  It would have been useful to know beforehand that the pool is free for guests, but the gym costs $12.   Overall, I'm happy with the hotel considering that it was only $106 a night on Hotwire, but I don't know that I'd go out of my way to pay full price for it.",3
2162,"I had never had occasion to stay in a hotel in Chicago before, so this was an unusual occasion.  The ICH turned out to be one of the nicest places I've ever stayed in (Hotel Indigo in Asheville, NC still takes the cake). Our room was in the older of the hotel's two towers, the one that used to house the Medina Athletic Club.  The room was on the 25th floor, and had great views up and down Michigan Avenue and out to the west. The Room itself was very spacious, and the bathroom was enormous, with a separate shower and bath. We got brunch in the hotel restaurant, and the buffet was off the chain in terms of quality and selection.  It was also priced accordingly . . . The topper, though, was the fitness facility housed in the hotel.  You have not only the gorgeous and historic swimming pool, but a full complement of cardio and weight equipment.  And the dry sauna was delightfully hot. On the down side (and hence the missing star), this place nickels and dimes you on things like internet.  I've heard not-so-great things about the promptness of their room service, but, almost needless to say, we did not order room service.  (At $18 for a ""Maxwell street polish sausage,"" can you blame us?)",4
2163,"This review is just for the lobby bar--never stayed here. A great place to catch a drink after shopping or before going to the movies.  Leather sofas and armchairs, no tv overload (1 flatscreen), and a quiet, ""men's club"" vibe.   I can also attest to the greatness that is Intercontinental's Kir Royale.  (the Kir is good too) But can't wait until this place is non-smoking--the guy next to us was instrusive with his smoking, not to mention his rosary.",4
2164,"Stayed here for my first anniversary and loved it. You really can't beat the location. As other folks have noted, the Intercontinental is really TWO buildings - the historic tower, and the addition, or ""new tower"" (I'm using the term ""new"" loosely), which is just to the north. The main hotel entrance is in the new tower, and that's where you'll check in, visit the concierge, etc. We had a corner room in the new tower, and it was great. Not large, by any means, but clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated (one window also opened!). Everyone from the bellhop to the check-in counter staff were professional, helpful, and friendly. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was flaky, but not a big deal. That said, the real allure of the Intercontinental is the historic tower. It has charm and history in spades. The first several floors are simply amazing. Each floor is decorated and painted in a medieval or renaissance manner which is astounding in detail. There are several small fountains, murals, nooks and crannies to explore. It's an entirely different experience from the new tower, and I feel sorry for the folks who stay at the hotel and never see the original building. We didn't stop at the hotel bar, but we did check out Eno, which is the wine, cheese and chocolate bar on the ground floor of the historic tower. The place is pricey, but fun if you're feeling indulgent. There are separate reviews of Eno on Yelp as well. The only other drawback was the expensive parking, which was over fifty a night. Keep in mind that parking costs are not included if you're booking the hotel thru a third party travel website.",4
2165,"I booked a room in this hotel for my friend and myself for the night before her wedding. My idea was to get a great night's sleep and be able to get ready for her wedding day in a beautiful setting. The Intercontinental lived up to all of my hopes. The Intercontinental takes classic hotel charm to a whole new level. The lobby is magnificent and the entire experience makes it worth every dollar spent to stay there. The rooms are beautifully decorated, and the bathrooms are huge! A definite benefit when getting ready for a wedding. 2 things I really loved about this hotel: When our mini-bar fridge started wheezing and whining at 12AM, they sent a repairman up immediately to fix it. Instead of fixing it in the room and keeping us up for the 45 minutes it would take, he actually brought a whole new fridge and switched the broken one out in less than 10 minutes. Sleep lost: none! Second, there's a Starbucks in the lobby. As any Starbucks addict will tell you, being able to get your morning coffee in your pajamas is a wonderful, wonderful thing. Location is great if you're an out-of-towner, rooms are comfortable, service is excellent, and the decor is beautiful. If you can afford it and are looking for more of a classic hotel vs. a modern boutique hotel, definitely stay here on your next trip to the city.",5
2166,"Recently stayed here for 10 days for a meeting.  I have to say the hotel was good, but not fantastic. I was in the historic tower which was nice, but unfortunately they only had 2 elevators to my floor, which made the wait quite bad some days.  The room itself was roomy and clean with a nice bed and tv/entertainment center.  Things were always clean. They charged for internet which was a pain since I was there for so long.  Also, the gym had a $18 one time fee which got you access to the pool (see other reviews...it is historic and nice) and a decent workout room. The service was good but I did not ask too much of them since I used yelp for most of my dining. THe location was great (right on the mag mile) and although not great for food would make this a great place in the spring/summer (too bad I was there in Jan)",3
2167,"Great Chicago hotel on Michigan avenue.  We had a really great stay here in a 15th floor corner room overlooking Michigan avenue. The room was really big but I can't recall if we had something up from a standard room.  We had 4 windows on Michigan Ave, 1 window facing north and two facing south.  The views at night were just amazing and really made for a sublime weekend. The bathroom was quite nice with an oversized bathtub and glass enclosed shower.  The bed and pillows were excellent.  One of the better beds I've had at a hotel. The hotel bar is really cool and fun.  It's open on two sides so it makes you feel in the center of things.  It opens and extends into the lobby. There is also a restaurant in the hotel called Eno on Michigan Ave.  This is probably the best wine bar I've been to, or at least the one I most enjoyed myself at.  It has very subdued lighting and a somewhat dark and rustic decor making it very romantic.  They have 700 varieties of wine and killer cheese plates and hand/home made chocolate truffles. Another great thing about this hotel is it's unconventional layout.  The first few floors of the hotel are a twisting and winding maze of mixed levels, mysterious statues, large doors to ballrooms, chandeliers, and places to peep out over the lobby. All this and it's actually reasonably priced.",5
2168,"Do stay here if you're on the company dime or get a deal off of hotwire, etc. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth the price, typically between $250 and $300 per night.  There are two different categories of rooms.  The main hotel used to be the Forum hotel back in the 1980's.  Back then, they advertised it as ""business class'.  The tower portion is much nicer but you'll pay a premium for one of these rooms.  Yes, their ammenties are very nice and the rooms in the tower are unusual, not your standard cookie cutter shaped hotel rooms.  The rooms in the main portion are nice just not as luxurious.     Catering staff does a bang up shop at a premium price.  I love the meeting space, very unusual but it is an old hotel so there are not a whole lot of wide open spaces for networking. Love the health club and the  indoor pool is totally cool,very 1930's Palm Beach vibe. Parking is expensive but what isn't off of Mich Ave? Trivia, you ask?  This is the only hotel with a Michigan Avenue address that actually has an entrance right on Michigan Avenue.  Cool, huh?",3
2169,"Stayed here during the MEG convention and i was not disappointed. They upgraded me to a suite and it was gorgeous - 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, huge bathroom. I had my own little living room. They always had an elevator ready to go. It was in a great location in the city. You can walk to all the stores and there were a ton of restaurants within walking distance. Expensive, but if you can afford it, stay there.",4
2170,"I can't figure out how many stars this hotel has? Is it considered a three star or a four star hotel?  If it is considered a four star, its not a very nice one. I was here on business, so I didn't pay for the room (not even sure how much it was) but I found it adequate. I didn't use the pool or the gym, but ate quite a bit hotel food and found it to be about as good as hotel food gets. The bathroom sucked; I found the toilet a little gross--it had one of those handles you push with your foot, and the tub wasn't quite clean enough, the lighting was awful and the bath products smelled awful. As other reviewers noted the televisions are flat screens, but the programming isn't HD. Luckily, the bed was one of the more comfortable hotel beds I've stayed in and I liked the little couch in my room. I was on the 22nd floor of the main tower, but even there most of the views were blocked by adjacent buildings. I found the service to be a little slow, perhaps they are understaffed. However, the concierge was quite knowledgable and helpful. I find it annoying to wait in a line to check-in or check-out. I probably wouldn't stay here again. Compared to other hotels, this one seemed to lack some degree of polish.",3
2171,"I have stayed at many hotels in Chicago over the years and this has been a favorite. Being the only hotel with a front entrance right onto the Magnificent Mile it is great to wake up in the morning and grab a cup of coffee from the Starbucks downstairs and walk right out onto The Mile. Location aside the lobby and rooms were modern and well appointed. I had a great view of Michigan Avenue from my room. Being busy I had not the chance to take advantage of the pool but I'm sure I will on my next visit which will actually be in two days. I can't stress enough how much location really matters in Chicago and this is in the perfect place. The staff was friendly and helpful, the valet service was on point but a little pricey...but on the same note it is downtown Chicago. I am staying again so that should tell you all you need to know.",4
2172,"I've stayed here many times because it's right across the street from our Chicago office.  The building is beautiful!  The lobby is grand and welcoming.  The front desk staff are always kind and act like they don't mind being at work (gasp, what a concept!). I've stayed in both towers.  The older tower has smaller bathrooms, but all in all they are about the same.  Although, I do have an affinity for large bathrooms with tubs AND a glass shower.  My most recent stay was in the older tower with the smaller bathroom. The room service is always good, albeit a little pricey.  Thank goodness for expense accounts.  The decor in the rooms has been updated to a nice modern motif.  I love all the pillows on the bed--I tend to surround myself with them while I sleep. I too had a problem with the water in the sink and in the shower.  The pressure and temperature would change, but I can deal with that.",4
2173,"You know I'm just using you for your pool, right? OK, cool. Now that we're on the same page, can I contradict that by adding ""and your wine bar""? Yeah, well yours is pretty great. And noshing delicious cheese and amazing wine does not prevent the swimming, so it all works out. The wine + cheese flights here are inspired, especially if your thing is to nerd out on wine and cheese. The thing that impressed me, although it could be considered overly corporate (whatevz) is that they added a printout of each cheese and wine's description right next to the thing. So instead of bugging your server to remind you which-is-which, you get a cute little card that you can tear out and bring home to enable future wine + cheese awesomeness.   They had a cheese flight that had ""coronary"" in the name. It's this amazing brie flight. I informally renamed one of them as ""Orgasmic Cheese."" That should tell you something.",4
2174,"The hotel has an amazing location, right on the Magnificent Mile and within walking distance to lots of shopping, restaurants, bars, and entertainment.  However, I was expecting something a little more.  Our room wasn't ready when my colleague showed up at 9pm.  They did give us coupons for drinks at the bar and for breakfast but really? The room wasn't ready at 9pm?  The remote control didn't work, one of the bedside lights didn't work and there wasn't a lot of lighting to begin with.  I suspect that the rooms in the older hotel tower are much larger and nicer.     The hotel bar was great for drinks and for people-watching.  If you do have breakfast at Zest, order off the menu and avoid the $27 breakfast buffet, it's not worth it.  Other than that, the hotel is stunning to look at and it has about the fastest elevator that I have ever been in.  However, I think if I am ever in Chicago again I will try staying somewhere else.",3
2175,"Ah, the venerable Intercontinental.  You definitely get the charm of an old fashioned grand hotel here.  Lobby is spacious yet comfortable and navigable.   The pool is special, if you like to hang out at indoor pools when you travel - probably great for the winter.  My hotel preferences lean towards the modern Hyatt -style places for business trips, but vacations feel more like vacations when you stay at a place like this. Pros: * surprisingly quiet * elegant without being pretentious * comfortable rooms with nice amenities * old building that doesn't feel like one * if you or your significant traveling buddy live to shop, then you can't beat this location and hotel - I can't think of a better place in Chicago to drop after you've shopped. Cons: * my room was really small - not much room to move around * limited views of anything but Michigan Ave (which is not really that bad actually)",5
2176,"What can I say about this hotel? First of all, it is in the perfect location and I mean absolutely perfect.  It is very beautiful, but for $500 a night can a sista get some heat?  I woke up at 3am freezing my butt off because our heat would not work properly.  Also, there was a huge spider on the ceiling that sent me into the restroom crying.  For the expense, you would also think internet might be free - wrong. Overall, the experience was OK, but I've stayed in better places.",3
2177,"Usually I am an easy going dude, but I have to vent about this hotel because I still have gripes about it days after checking out. 1.  The rooms have decor for OLD people.  I always joke about this hotel chain and say its great for old people. 2.  The beds were the most uncomfortable beds I have ever slept on, period.  LIke sleeping on the floor seemed like a better option at one point when I tossed and turned. 3.  The internet was not good.  I need a stable connection to do my work, and the wireless only option kind of sucked.",2
2178,Stayed in the Historic Tower which has a beautifully ornate restaurant and swimming pool. The rooms are vey dark and not to my taste but the room service was responsive. Plentiful buffet breakfast ($27) and the hotel lobby has a Starbucks. The hotel is very conveniently located on Michigan Ave. 15 min walk to Macy's downtown or 15 min walk to Water Tower Place. Plenty of restaurants and bars within a 5-10 min walk.,3
2179,Ehhh.. I was expecting more out of a four star hotel.  The room was nice.. but the shower water varied as I took a shower in the morning.  I also wasn't impressed with their lobby or bar area.  The entire lobby also lacks one trash can.  I would have also liked to have some bubble bath since there was a separate tub.  Oh.. and breakfast would be nice. It's a decent location though and the staff is terrific.  Very friendly and helpful.. not snobby at all. I think I would say it's a great 3 star.. or a poor 4 star.,4
2180,"Back in the 80's, this hotel was a Radisson and a dump. You could look  up at the florescent lighting and see the rats running around. Intercontinental saved a beautiful landmark hotel. I had a baby shower here for my wife. The staff did an outstanding job. I've worked some conferences in the beautiful grand ballroom. The rooms here are nice, but the service is top notch.",4
2181,"This was the hotel that we were assigned for our winter holiday in Chicago.  Per usual, I used the ol P.line and paid a very reasonable price for the room.   The main entrance is located on Michigan avenue, and it's possible to be stopped at an odd angle, though it shouldn't hinder anyone from unloading or loading people or luggage.  The concierge desk is very closely located to the main entrance, and service was speedy. The actual room was in the main tower with a city view.  It was amply sized, and all needed amenities were present.  This is a convenient location, and includes a few restaurants/bars with a Starbucks in in the building.",4
2182,"If you are looking for a special and memorable place to stay in the Windy City, I don't suggest the Intercontinental. If you are simply looking for a place to rest your head on a business trip, then I do suggest the Intercontinental. That pretty much says it all. There is nothing really wrong with the hotel, its just very corporate and very boring. Nothing amazing, high class, or extraordinary about it. The rooms were just fine, a tad small even for our upgraded room. The bathrooms were nice and big with a separate tub and shower. The service was great, everyone was very friendly. There was just nothing noteworthy or memorable. We got the room for 99 a night on Hot Wire and in retrospect, wish we would have booked something a little grander for our anniversary. There is always next time!",3
2183,"I stayed at the InterContinental for three nights, I have to admit, if it wasn't for the fact that I booked through Travelocity, which means no adjustments, I would've checked myself into another hotel after the first night. Front desk lady was very friendly however that was the extent of good customer service. I got to my room, waited 45 minutes for my luggage (I only had one);  The Mini Bar was missing in my room so I called the Concierge and was told there will be one coming my way. After nearly an hour and a half, I called the front desk to cancel the Mini Bar delivery b/c it was approaching midnight. The lady simply just said ""Kk.""   I believe the phrase she was looking for was: ""I'm sorry, I'll get that ready for you right away.""  Ordered room service, was told the food would be ready in 30 minutes or less, waited over an hour; again, no apologies from the staff. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It's right on Michigan Avenue, close to lots of shops, restaurants and convenient stores. There's a Nordstrom & tons of other shops right across the street; a Walgreens adjustment to the hotel; Grand Lux Café & Joe's Seafood/Steak restaurant is two blocks down; Fox & Obel grocery & café is four blocks behind the hotel; Bank of America is right across the street; the hotel is within minutes of walking from many attractions;  not to mention there's a Starbucks downstairs. Even though the hotel itself was nice as previously stated, but the rooms are very small (standard sized room), you can barely get the room service cart in through the door! Lack of toiletry. Most importantly, given hotels are supposed to be about hospitality and customer service, I'd have to give my experience a three star and I believe that's plenty generous.",3
2184,"I have two very embarrassing stories I could print here in relation to the Intercontinental but I will let your little Yelping minds wonder.... Lovely hotel with a lot of nostalgia.  The beds are not so comfy in my opinion (stay at the Wyndham and you will agree) but the decor and the amenities are quite nice.  I'd give the IC more star-power if it weren't for a few things: 1.  Poopy internet in my room and even worse in the meeting rooms 2.  Food that consistently gave me heart-scarring indigestion I hate i didn't get a chance to chillout in Eno, but I am sure I will be seeing the IC again.",3
2185,"My experience was with their lobby bar, I have not stayed at the hotel.  I was working with an out of town News Crew for elections, that was stationed outside of the Tribune Tower next door for two long 14 hour hour days.    And it was very cold.  Since the News Station had the team staying at a hotel all the way down by Hancock, it was impossible for us to go back and forth all day long. We hung out in the lobby bar for two days, and ordering all of our meals and coffee drinks.  I was so surprised at the quality of the food and the service. When you have to be outside every half hour in the cold, you need a warm refuge.  And this was the spot.  Even though we were not guests of the hotel, the staff treated us as such.   During the second day, as I was getting more and more harried, I rushed in to look for one of our crew and a waiter met me at the revolving door, saw the look on my face and said ""Ma'am, your guy is over there.""  Talk about paying attention! Great stuff!",4
2186,"I would never pay full price for this hotel, but Hotwire got us a last minute deal for Lollapalooza, when hotels were tough to come by, so it was great for the price. The room was nice, the bed was comfortable for 2, the flat panel TV was large (32"" or bigger), and everything else seemed to be up to par with a nice hotel. The location is the one thing it really has going for it. Right on Michigan Avenue, a few blocks from the river, you'll get to pretty much everything from here on foot if you want to. But then there's the downsides. The ""high-speed internet access"" was a $13 per day wireless setup. When a hotel costs $350 per night for a room (full price, not what I paid), I'd expect that the internet access be reasonably priced if not free. $13 is ridiculous. And it wasn't all that ""high-speed"" either. On top of that, everything in the room had a price. Want a bottled water? That'll be $6.95 please. Forgot your toothbrush? Only $3 for this generic brush-on-a-stick. Grab a Coke out of the ""Refreshment Center?"" For $3.75, no problem! The drapes definitely didn't keep the light out as well as I'd hope, just as someone else mentioned. The towels were average, there was no fan in the bathroom so the mirror was always fogged up, and the remote for the TV was near useless. A few people mentioned that the water in the shower/sink would constantly change temperature, and I noticed the same thing in my room (I just love having my warm shower turn into a scalding hot shower). I wouldn't stay here again unless Hotwire assigned it to me.",3
2187,"My husband and I needed to vacate our apartment for a night and we utilized Hotwire to get a hotel room. We ended up at the Intercontinental and I am pleased that we did. Now, I had been to the bar numerous times for high-end cocktails (delicious, incidentally) but had never been in a room.  The rooms are decorated tastefully, if not a bit boring. But the bathroom was big, the bed was comfy and the small window-thick drape combo made our room look like 2 am when it was 8 in the morning. Oh, Glorious Darkness! I will definitely recommend the Intercontinental to friends when they come to town. Could they stay with me? Sure. But with the street lamps outside our place, it looks like 8am at 2 in the morning. Sadness.",4
2188,"My sweetie and I spent a night here to celebrate our anniversary after scoring a deal on Hotwire for $99.  Great hotel: wonderfully helpful staff, prompt room service for that toothpaste I forgot, beautiful decor, a room on the 32nd floor in the famous historic tower that had a great view of a city and overlooked the Magnificent Mile.  The bath products are great (gotta love creamy, lightly-scented body lotions that are made in France) as was the bathroom itself, with a spacious glass shower and a separate bathtub to boot.  The location is hard to beat: we really appreciated being able to wander Michigan Avenue, stop in at the Apple store to play with the new iPad and buy some stuff at Watertower. I would say that Hotwire/Groupon are the way to go for this place.  I think single rooms with a King-sized bed usually go for around $300, and that simply is too much for what you get.  The room was rather small, and as a result the furniture was awkwardly placed, with the TV oriented perpendicularly to the bed and difficult to watch from the bed.  But for $99, with access to a gym and a pool (neither of which we used--it was a laaaazy weekend)?  Definitely a deal.",3
2189,"In short... decent room.... terrible service. I was in Chicago last week on business and my company put me up here. I wont say it was terrible but I have experienced better. It is a good thing I didn't have to pay for the stay or I would have been really mad. I had a standard room, it was clean and nicely decorated. In another review I saw someone complain about a chair with stuffing spilling out. I don't know if I was in the same room, but I also had a chair with stuffing hanging out. However, the leather that the chair was covered with was amazing, I only sat in that chair. I don't blame them for not getting rid of it and I don't think that it could be repaired. The internet is outrageously overpriced 14.95 per 24 hours. I was in desperate need of internet so I bit the bullet and signed on (I am responsible for incidentals). They had to take my card for incidentals and said they would put a $50 hold on my account. The second day I was there they had put additional holds on my account. I went to talk to the front desk about it. I am a veteran of the Restaurant industry and I know that treating people badly never gets you what you want, so even when complaining I am always calm, polite, and patient. In discussing the issue with the front desk they were polite and attentive but ultimately treated me like I was stupid. Kept saying there was nothing they could do about canceling the hold, I would have to call my bank. In the end I realize that the issue resulted from my not being informed. At check in I signed a form, I asked to see a copy of that form, it clearly explained there would be a $125 hold placed for each day that I stayed. A little excessive if you ask me. But why couldn't the front desk just explain to me that that was hotel policy? I would have understood. Instead they acted like they had no idea, and claimed there was nothing they could do. I was there for two nights, and did not want to pay $30 for internet access, so I only signed on the one day. At check out I made it a point to mention that the only incidentals would be the one day of internet, and confirmed that the holds would be credited back to me less one day on internet. Then the front desk tells me the internet was complementary! WTF it would have been nice to know that when I checked in!!!!!!!! I don't know if breakfast came with the room, because I didn't ask and they certainly don't volunteer helpful information.",2
2190,went to Breakfast on a sunday we had made a reservation and it was not ready when we arrived on time. It wasn't that busy so I was a little surprised. the tater tots on the buffet were also a little surprising?,4
2191,$19.95 a day for wifi.   I dislike being ripped off.,1
2192,"This is the first real hotel I've had the pleasure to stay in. I think I've been ruined for life. The room is really nice, and the bathroom is amazing. There is a tub and a glass shower.  In the bathroom there are Crabtree & Evelyn products, which is really nice. (If you got the shower with a curtain, its because you've been put in a handicap style room- kind of a plus because of the extra space) We ordered room service our first night in, and while it was expensive, it was the best room service we have had to date. Real flowers on our table? Real silver? Im not kidding. Our server who delivered it even wanted to serve us... but Im just not ready for that level of commitment yet. The pool area is amazing. Its a mosaic tyled junior olympic size swimming pool. They have a great fitness center as well, and offer reflexology and massages by appointment. I dont want to leave.",5
2193,"I was in Chicago on a business trip and stayed a full week at this hotel. From the moment of my arrival, it was clear that the hotel staff were there to cater to my needs. All staff were polite and extremely helpful. Check-in was easy, the room was not big, but it was clean and very comfortable. The views were amazing! The hotel is on the Magnificent Mile which is central to excellent restaurants, night life, transportation and makes exploring the city on foot very easy. I loved it. I'm definitely returning to this hotel.",5
2194,"The Intercontinental Hotel is a ""nice"" place to sleep only because there are beds and that is more comfortable than sleeping on the floor.  I know I am being harsh, but for almost $300 a night (and that is with a group discount) the bed best be one that inspire me to sleep as soon as I look at it.  This requirement was not met.  The bed was not comfortable and the pillows are too soft, I could barely sleep the full night without tossing and turning. I am not a picky person when it comes to hotels because my eyes are closed most of the time I am in my room.  When I am not asleep, I am watching television.  This is were the 32-ish inch flat panel screen ""should"" be great, but the feed was standard definition analog stations. When not in my room, I was attending the conference I was in Chicago for.  Most of conference rooms were good, but some seemed to be extra wide hallways.  The reason i did not do anything else in the hotel, like go the gym, is because everything cost extra.  I have never been to a hotel where everything (including the gym) was a la cart. The food provided for the conference was good, but the bar closed too early. So in summary: Too Expensive Everything A La Cart Uncomfortable Beds Good Food Bar Makes for Early Nights",2
2195,"My company hosted a gala in there this past weekend and man this place is beautiful! Can't speak for the rooms and overnight stays, but the event nooks are awesome. littered with old school charm",3
2196,"Overall: I just wasn't impressed by the results for what I paid. Pluses: -Very Clean -excellent concierge, front desk and bell staff. Minuses: -I don't mind paying for internet, but this was useless slow internet.  They had 2 tiers.  256 Kbps for 15, and 1 GBps for 18.  The first night, i cheaped out and suffered for it.  The second, I upgraded and still suffered.   -When I travel, I like to unpack and be organized so I can find things.  That way, I can pack my laundry into my suitcase as my trip goes on.  Unfortunately the hotel (at least for my room) is devoid of dressers.",2
2197,"I'm from Los Angeles so perhaps my expectations are unrealistically high...  The good news:  the staff is very helpful, the location is ideal and the rooms are decent.  However!  They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING and I'm talking E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G!  I'm surprised there's not a $2.00 fee to look out the window.  They charge you $5.00 to watch last week's Saturday Night Live, a show that aired for FREE.  The upcharges are obnoxious.  I wouldn't stay here again - it's a total ripoff.",2
2198,"Love the pool at the Intercontinental Hotel on Michigan Avenue.  The pool is back in business after being shut down by the city of Chicago for a few months (like many other pools in the city).  Well, now the most famous pool in Chicago is back and so refreshing...not small kid friendly so bring water wings, floaties, etc for the small kids.  Health club staff, Robert and Tereza, are exceptional.  Always friendly and courteous....a great asset to the hotel.  Locker rooms are clean and have dry saunas in both the men's and women's sides.  Always good for a sweat!  Would be great if they could remove the massage room in the men's locker room and replace it with a steam room.  It's too noisy in the locker room to have the massage room next to the showers.  Ask to have your massage in the more private space.  Also, the health club is getting all new flooring and new equipment this week.  Can't wait to try out the new state of the art equipment.",4
2199,"Not your typical InterContinental hotel. Yes, the architecture is nice,  but.... The rooms are tiny There is no furniture to store my clothes The check in staff is grumpy The door staff is MIA I'm there now, and cannot recommend this hotel.",3
2200,"This review is about Chris in the catering department; he is amazing!  Chris has been helping us plan our wedding at the Intercon and he has been such a pleasure to work with!  He is very responsive to emails and has never seemed annoyed by the endless questions I have to ask.  We haven't had our wedding there yet but if Chris is any indication of how our wedding with go, then I have great hopes that all will be wonderful!",5
2201,"The Intercontinental feels like home to me, considering (that aside from the Convention Center), I've spent the majority of my 72 hours here. The stinging pain of 7 am debriefings is palliated slightly by breakfasts in the majestic Moorish ballroom, with its view of the city skyline. Although my boss will freak at my $35 room service tab for a glass of wine and French onion soup, it was served with Midwestern hospitality (pronounced with a hard ""a""). Personally, I love hotels!  Heaven is ordering room service and watching The Sopranos. I deducted a star only because the water pressure is slighly weak and the loud a/c, which interferes with sleep.",4
2202,"I attended a wedding here in the Grand Ballroom which was absolutely magnificent...I told my friends that I'm having my wedding reception here!  Everything is so elegant and pristine.  We had drinks and unbelievable appetizers (in another gorgeous room) before we were moved to the Grand Ballroom.  I can't wait to visit again.  Hopefully, I'll be staying in one of the hotel rooms...Presidential Suite...?   =)",5
2203,"My company hosted a 3-day seminar here so I had a room in the newer wing of the hotel for 4 nights on my boss's dime. The three stars represent my persepective as a paying customer, not as someone with an expense account (I would give them four stars from that perspective). First of all, the staff here are fabulous. My room was spotless every night when I returned to it. The banquet staff who catered our seminar were cheerful and seemed to honestly care that we were getting good service. Food was kept hot and replenished regularly, and the service was seemless. In that respect we were well taken care of. The service itself was definitely 5 stars. I do feel, for this caliber of hotel, that the management nickles and dimes its customers, however. My room was almost three hundred a night, and along with that cost, I had to pay $17.99 for wi-fi access, a bottle of Evian in my room was priced at $7, a 375ml bottle of Clos de Bois in the mini bar was priced at $24 (come on man! this stuff is just two steps up from jug wine), and they wanted $5 for a toothbrush, which most hotels give away for free as a courtesy to harried travelers who forgot theirs. We didn't bring enough power strips for the seminar and was charged $25 per day to use one of thiers. Had I the time, I would have just run to Office Depot to buy one instead of spending $100 of my company's money that could have gone into my bonus check. Lame. The location is very convenient, with lots of stores and restaurants nearby, but the area is a bit to hoity toity for my tastes over the span of 4 days. Michigan Ave. was off the hook last night with the Blackhawks Stanley Cup win - every sports bar in the area was spilling Chi-towners into the streets to hoot and holler about it. Just know you will be in the thick of things here. Also know that the hotel bar is quite popular. I actually could not get a seat at the bar one night, it was so crowded, but I ended up taking a cab to a less-toney part of town to drink anyway and be with my ""people."" Worth staying here if you aren't footing the bill for sure. Maybe a bit much if you are.",3
2204,"I've stayed at the Intercontinental many times and have had almost universally positive experiences. You absolutely cannot beat the location - it is super central and the higher floors have a great view of Michigan Ave., the Chicago river and the Wrigley Building. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms are nice and spacious.",4
2205,"I always recommend this hotel to my friends and family when they visit Chicago. It's not as trendy as most of the hotels I like, but the rooms are very nice and it's an amazing location (especially for those who love to shop). My parents have also found hotel rooms here for as little as $159/night, which is quite a good deal for a nice hotel in Chicago!",4
2206,Horrible customer service!,2
2207,"Stayed here over the weekend 2/11/12 and I will say that for the most part, I enjoyed my stay.  We arrived in Chicago around 11 a.m. and were able to check in right away. Check in was fast and my husband had no problems.  (We typically stay at Intercontinentals and have had our share of problems with checking in on past vacations.)  The room was clean and decent - had 2 full bathrooms and we had a view of Michigan Avenue from the 10th floor which was nice.  The location was great and it is right across the street from a mall and right by all the North Michigan shopping areas.  I was impressed with the bed - it was very comfortable.  Bed and pillows were perfect - and for me, that doesn't happen very often.  The hotel has a place called Eno which is a place where you can sample wine, chocolates, and cheese and the Michael Jordan Steakhouse is also inside.  Valet and doormen were very helpful which was appreciated.  The only downfall of our trip and the reason why I didn't give the hotel 4 stars is because it was very loud as I was trying to go to sleep.  The walls appear to be very thin and the group in the room next to me were being very loud - laughing, talking (I could tell you every word in their conversations...) and just having a good time.  Now I understand that I am in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night, however, I am a customer too and I feel that at 1:30 a.m, I should be able to get some rest.  I called downstairs to ask the front desk what could be done and she said she would send security up....around 2:30 a.m., the noise finally stopped.  It wouldn't have been a big deal if I didn't have a train to catch at 6:00 a.m.  But anyways, that was the only thing I didn't like, that it took security almost an hour to get the people quieted down.  Good hotel otherwise.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Right now the pool is closed for renovations and hotel valet overnight is $54.  Wowza, good thing we took a cab.  Cabs are aplenty in this area so that was no problem, but Michigan Ave. is very trafficky, so you may pay more because you sit in traffic a lot.  Also, the hotel in general is a bit noisy because cabbies like to honk their horns as if it's gonna make anyone move faster, and that can be heard from inside the hotel at times.",3
2208,"This review is not for the hotel but for the event space. Their main ballroom is just beautiful!! It is magical. When we were outside, having cocktails, I wasn't all that impressed. Then when our party was allowed to proceed into the ballroom, phwooaar! It was love at first sight. The dance floor is big, the columns impressive, with two sweeping stairwells that curve oh-so-sweetly. I think they have a small platform too, perhaps for a band, or just some drunken exhibitionists who want to do the electric slide for everyone to see? It is a really beautiful space for an event - I highly recommend it for a big party. __________________________________________________­_ UPDATE 6/9/08 : my girl friends and I went to the wine bar in this hotel last night  because it was close / convenient. I did not find the seating arrangement  ideal, as we were jammed in between two parties (a drunk, touristy group, and an awkward first date). I'm all about a ""howdy"" meet-your-neighbor communal table, except...not in a wine bar. Wine bar is for intimacy and intrigue! How can you get that when you hear every whisper, or non-whisper, to your left and right. However, I will forgive them somewhat because they had great chocolate (pepper! jalapeno! raspberry!) and decent cheese selection (Blue Haze, yum) and I had a really rather sublime Oregon pinot noir that came in just the most delicate bowl of a glass. Ahhh, bliss. Then we kind of wandered into the pool and fitness center to check out their pool. Wow, it's awesome. Very Egyptian meets Spanish tile. Very Indiana Jones meets King Arthur's Court.",5
2209,"Definitely one of the best locations on Michigan Avenue.  While it's not the center of luxury, the prices certainly reflect the amenities.  Rooms are cozy and clean.  Elevators are relatively quick for a big city, boutique-style hotel.  The credit card authorization amount for checking in (per day) is ridiculous.  Management should really take note of that policy and re-think it.  I'll definitely be back, over and again!",3
2210,"This is probably one of the best hotels in Chicago.  The Intercontinental has a fabulous location on Michigan Avenue, and it has excellent service and is very nice.  The hotel lobby is extremely nice and has a very important, upscale feel to it, while the rooms are nicely decorated and are very clean and comfortable.  I haven't seen the pool but I heard it is gorgeous, and it is directly connected to Zest Restaurant which I've heard is fab.",5
2211,"I've never stayed there, but the bartender made a kick-ass Kir Royale, which gives it 4 stars in my book.  Plus, the boys in the bar were very cute.",4
2212,"This is such a nice hotel! A couple friends and I had a girls night out (er, night in, since we were all a little tired on a Fri. night) last weekend. I will admit I used the wrong set of elevators, and I felt like a huge dork.  Well, I wasn't paying attention to notice two sets of elevators (on opposite sides of the hotel).  Oops. We didn't check out the restaurant/bars in the hotel, but they looked pretty interesting to try at another time. Our room was nice, and we had a decent view of Michigan Ave. Is it weird to comment that the bathroom in our room was well lit? I will, anyway, but it's only because I like a bright bathroom, esp. in hotels. A good hotel to recommend to out of towners....well, also to those in Chicago!",4
2213,"Stayed there this weekend for a wedding we were going to. Wedding and reception were in the building! We did not vallet - we had family in town that took our car for the night.... 54 bucks for a day is obnoxious. When we checked in, we had a King Suite reserved.  We were traveling with an infant & two baby sitters in tow.  The room was nice, but there was no seperation between the sitting room and bed room, eventhough it appeared so on the website.  They also said there were two bathrooms... while this room had one.  My husband called the front desk, and they told him that nothing else was available.  Boo... but we would survive.  I also had read somewhere that there was a fridge available in each room.  One more call to the front desk reveiled the fact, that only the mini bar is available.  I was informed though by the room service man, that if I opened the bar, removed items, but left them with the bar, we would not be charged, because it was not one of those lame pressure sensitive ones.  Yay!   So, my husband went to check in with some friends about the quickly impending wedding (1 hr away) and on his way back to the room he checked at the desk and was able to get us the room that we were looking for!   TIP - after booking we joined the frequent guest club... so when they asked my hubbie if he belonged they gave us the upgrade. The new room had a bedroom with french doors separating and two bathrooms.  The only downside - it was on the smoking floor.  The floor was not bad though, air cleaners in the hallways and in the room(as long as they are on)... so i was not feared for my 6 month olds lungs, and my smoking baby sitters could smoke in their bathroom - with the fan on. The room was very nice.  No complaints - with the comment that the shower head's back was missing. Huge bathroom off the bedroom.... smaller one off the sitting room! Five huge pillows on the bed.  Super comfy bed.  Big TVs.  Late check out available (We needed it after the great wedding that their wedding co-ordinaters throw together!)",4
2214,If it wasn't for the location this would be a one star review. Hotel staff is just not what you expect from a Michigan Avenue experience. Hotel is crowded with foreigners primarily Europeans. The hotel is nice but not consistent with the price. Our room temperature control was broken and had to have engineering fix it. We spent one very cold night. They charge $18/day for Internet access and wait until you hear this... $12 to use the treadmill at the fitness center. This rule must go since it is just ridiculous. Again location makes this a good choice but the Marriott across the street is a much better choice.,3
2215,"The InterContinental is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago, and it has a great location on North Michigan Avenue. The main lobby, a modern concoction that is not particularly memorable, helps to connect what amounts to two buildings smushed together. Try to look around at some of the older public areas and the exteriors and you will be impressed by an assortment of fine details. The indoor swimming pool is beautiful, and my corner room was terrific.",5
2216,"It's a great place to stay for a holiday weekend shopping trip.  The Historic, or south tower is the former Medina Athletic club.  Be sure to check out the junior olympic swimming pool and browse the conference and meeting rooms in the Historic tower The interior decorating in this tower is definitely unique.  Room service, while expensive, is very good.  The lounge is comfortable and the staff is very accommodating.  I'll definitely go back (and not just because I can stay for free)",4
2217,"I concur that 3.5 stars just about nails this place. It was just ok really. i will give kudos to the bellman as well as the helpful concierge. As a matter of fact, I really liked our waitress in the wine bar too, so maybe I will give SERVICE a 4 star and the hotel room itself a 3 (nothing too special). the location was great, smack in the middle of anywhere you want to go along the ""Magnificent Mile"" and easy enough to grab a cab anywhere else.",3
2218,"Taking advantage of a groupon coupon I decided to use this for Valentine's Day, so the price was right for what is typically a pricey hotel.  The staff here is very friendly and nice offering us a late checkout, but we had to go to work the next day.  The room was nice and plush.  The bed was comfortable.  Our view wasn't that great, probably the worst of any other hotel I've stayed at in Chicago.  It was smaller than what I was used to but it was just nice to get away.  I was a little surprised that they didn't have free bottled water considering it's more of the higher end of the Priority Rewards end of the chain, and we got bottled water at a Hotel Indigo.  I like that there's a Starbucks attached to the hotel.",3
2219,"Loved it! Ok...it has best location...right on Mich ave right across from the yummiest food place, the Purple Pig.  This was our second time staying here for one of our anniversary. Long line to check in but we got there n checked in. Got our room but found it to be wrong. They upgrade us to historic room. Best deal ever.  We got totally isolated within one corridor, there was just our room and one other.  There were even steps up to our door which had its own personal door bell.  Cute.  Loved the huge entry way and separate shower and bath.  Room was twice as big as the previous room with a great view.  Service was just awesome.  Will have to return next time.  Oh, our room was supposed to be $1500 and we got it for less than $200?  AWESOME!",5
2220,"Cannot beat the location, entrance right out to Michigan St. Smiling Doormen made us feel welcome. Beautiful and classy lobby. Check in took awhile, seemed to take about 15 minutes per party but I guess that's just good guest service right? We were in what I believe was the older part of the hotel. Room was very small (which we expect in Chicago), and carpets were worn. Bathroom was very clean and seemed to be more updated than the actual room itself. Old TV (no flat screen). Starbucks in the hotel was convenient. Took forever to get our car from Valet parking but our vehicle eventually arrived without a scratch so all's well that ends well. Planning a return trip to Chicago soon and not planning to stay here. Lots of other places on the Magnificent Mile to try!",3
2221,"A fabulous place for anyone to stay!  Its huge, super nice and right on the magnificant mile!  If its your first time to Chicago, staying here would be a good start!",5
2222,"I stayed one night at this hotel and I really wasn't there that much during that time.  Our room was really small, it had one king size bed and a couch that was big enough to sleep on but the cushions were very hard and not very comfortable.  The view was nice but it's far enough from the lake that even if you have a lake view, there are lots of buildings and construction in the way of the view.  The location is great, right on MI Ave and somewhat in the middle of Water Tower, Navy Pier and State St if you are walking.  The bathroom had 2 different levels of lights and the shower was pretty was nice.  The Crabtree & Evelyn bath products came home with me.",4
2223,"Simply gorgeous, inside and out, the views, everything is just outstanding. Fabulous downtown location, breathtaking views (especially if you stay in the old tower). The bar is fun with great drinks, top notch bartenders, and comfy couch/chair seating. The chocolate restaurant/wine bar is fabulous and an experience you should definitely have. The room was huge, the bathroom was huge, everything was updated nicely, and a very large flat screen tv- the chocolate truffles were a really nice touch too!  All of the staff were truly exceptional, and they went out of their way to ensure a lovely stay.",5
2224,Great location but parking is ridiculous! Front desk agents were robots and make me feel like i'm just another reservation.  Room was nice but nothing special.  I'd look elsewhere for the price.,3
2225,"This is a perfect place to stay in Chicago. You will definitely feel like a celebrity because of the grand decor and service at this hotel. Its beautifully designed and decorated, making a trip to Chicago even more fun. And while you sleep like a celebrity, you can shop and eat like one too along the Mag Mile.",5
2226,"I stayed in this hotel for a week. I thought overall the hotel was good. I was irked that they have the balls to charge $12 PER COMPUTER, PER DAY for Internet. I consume lots of ice, and I was disappointed that the ice is only on the 7th floor. The room was a decent size, and they have a good plasma TV. Actually you should bring your media players because they have all kinds of connections including HDMI!!! Whoohoo! The place has a Starbucks in the building, and a nearby Walgreen's. You have to pay for the gym, but the pool/sauna is free.  Not bad.",3
2227,"One of the best hotels in Chicago, the Intercontinental boasts old world charm with contemporary elegance. The four-story lobby, which features a grand staircase and bronze embellishments, makes you feel as if you were a movie star. After a long day of shopping on the Mag Mile, you'll have to cool down and take a dip in the gigantic pool. A must see for all those traveling from abroad!",5
2228,"Yeah, the room decor is outdated - but the room size compensates. The customer service was wonderful. I dont know how much the employees are getting paid, but it must be enough to act like they genuinely want you to be there, and they want to wait on you. Do yourself a favor and just explore the hotel. The architecture is amazing; beautiful Victorian marble water fountains are in hallways, and I understand all of the architecture is original. If I had to complain, my one complaint would be the food in the hotel restaurant. Overpriced and not delicious. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend the intercontinental - and of course stay again.",4
2229,"I don't see what the big deal is.  I've stayed at this hotel twice, and the rooms are super small and nothing special.  I think the ballrooms are nice, as I have been to a wedding here, and a company event here as well.  But other than that I don't feel like its worth the money.  I haven't had a bad experience with the staff, but I didn't feel like they were over the top extraordinary.I wouldn't stay here again unless it was free.  I think there are lots of cooler hotels in Chicago.",3
2230,"My sister had her wedding here a few years ago and I was very impressed.  Everything turned  out perfect and my family was thrilled with the service. I'm biased since it's my own sister, but I definitely think it's one of the nicest weddings I've ever attended.",4
2231,My parents stayed at the Intercontinental the last time they visited Chicago and they loved it. It's a very nice hotel with large guest rooms and in the perfect location on Michigan Avenue. They are planning on returning to Chicago next month and want to stay at the Intercontinental once again.,4
2232,"NOTE: This review is for their meeting and event services only. I was responsible for meeting with approx. 60 attendees and was not impressed at all by the meeting services.  Every request we made was either denied or finally fulfilled, after an eternity of discussions.  When reviewing rooms for our upcoming session, we voiced our concern that they are not big enough.  Finally, the event coordinator had facilities place tables in the room, so we could visualize whether or not we could fit our people.  We determined that we couldn't which resulted in the manager stopping by and telling us that we could easily fit them and since he doesn't share our concerns with us, he will not make another room available for us.  Now that's what I call customer service...NOT.  Accommodating is not a word in this man's vocabulary.  Apparently it didn't matter that we had already spent a pretty penny there and were going to do the same at the upcoming meeting.  Needless to say, we pulled our upcoming meeting from the Intercontinental and instead had it at the Four Seasons (hallelujah!!!).",1
2233,This place is great. We had a problem last time we were suppose to stay. They made up for it this time it great they up graded are room to a penthouse on the highest floor. It had 2 bathrooms. It was faboulous. I would defiently stay here again. Great view of all of Chicago.,5
2234,Love the decor!! I've had tea here with a client of mine who just happened to stay here on her business trips. I absolutely Love this hotel. I've been here so much I believe the Service Staff are getting to know me personally (they know that I love black current Tea or just classic V/T's for coctails) .. The decor is really nice and the service is fantastic! ..,4
2235,"Classy, clean and just all around excellent service. I stayed at this hotel on the magnificent mile. What can I say just wonderful things about it. It is quiet yet sits on a street where there is great shopping to be had, lovely restaurants and abundance of bars to wet your whistle. They got a nice pool that cooled me down in that hot, muggy weather. I got to say this is a real nice hotel.",5
2236,You've got to check it out.,5
2237,"The hotel is very nice and the staff is very attentive.  We stayed in the Historic Tower and the views were spectacular.  We had a direct view of the Trump Tower and the River.  My only complaint is that the internet is very slow, but that seemed to be a common theme throughout Chicago when using my iPhone. The hotel is in the middle of everything - shopping, food, some decent bars. Also, the indoor pool was great.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.",4
2238,"i stayed at this hotel a couple weekends ago with my family (who were in town visiting)... my mom thought she would splurge for a nice hotel on michigan ave to make their visit extra special.  she bragged that she found us a four and a HALF star hotel- fancy from where i come from. we got in the room- bleh. the a/c barely cooled the room on a warm/not even hot summer day. bathroom was a little outdated and 'used'... not the cleanest ive ever seen.  and the staff- like robots. location is great, yes, but there are cheaper and nicer hotels in the city.",2
2239,"Hotwire listed this hotel as 4 1/2 stars, frankly it hardly qualifies as 3 stars.  While the location is fantastic, the hotel itself leaves a little to be desired. I got a great rate through hotwire, but if I would have paid the regular rate I would have been furious. The decor was tacky with peeling wallpaper and stained carpet and there was no mini bar or fridge in the room. Our friends in the room next to us had a mini bar, but we did not. The maids did a horrible job at cleaning the room and did no more than pull the covers up over the bed. Also, there was no umbrella in the room....if you are staying in a rainy city like Chicago you should have an umbrella in the closet! The room was very small and standard. There is nothing elegant about this hotel at all, Hotwire needs to update their rating.",3
2240,"Stayed there for three nights starting July 16, 2009. Got a very low rate on Hotwire and then was upgraded because my brother knew somebody that knew somebody. Overall it was awesome. Beds were comfy, it was quiet. Location is great - but you have to figure out how to get to the red line station ( cross the street, go down unmarked stairwell, walk 2 blocks...). Pool was refreshing, but very old-school and not set up for hanging out. Starbucks in the lobby was great. Location was perfect.",4
2241,"We stayed in one of the executive double bed suites. Absolutely marvelous marble bathrooms...lovely shower...Rooms was decorated beautifully. We had large screen TVs in both rooms. The toiletries were wonderful...Had room service in the morning and the Eggs Benedict was EXCELLENT...Service was prompt, efficient and friendly. Couldn't have enjoyed it more. We'll be back this next weekend....",5
2242,"For starters, this is a beautiful hotel on truly prime location (just across the wrigley building). The exterior is flawless and there is even  a starbucks inside (major plus in my book). Now, the service is OK at best. I was in a hurry to go to a meeting one morning and got lost. The flow of the meeting space is horribly designed. I then asked for help from employees who could not help me. To top it off apparently some elevators go to a certain floor and  I got mixed up there too. The rooms were too small for my liking and I heard they finished renovating... hmmm I think they need to start over. My lasting moment was meeting their GM, Edward Andrews. Best words to describe him is rude and sloppy. How in the world he got his position is beyond me. Sum things up, historical hotel with character but it definitely needs some fine retuning from the top down. Not very impressed and won't be staying here again. Restaurants were yummy so if you want a quick bite or some starbucks go here otherwise don't even bother wasting your time there.",1
2243,"Great location!  I used to walk by here all the time when I lived in Chi-town.  For those of you who love their Starbucks, the chain store has displaced the former Zest.  I was shocked, but I guess Starbucks turns more tables and makes more money than your average hotel restaurant.  Last year we stayed here and had a lake view.   That room and bathroom was larger.  This year, we got room 941 which is a corner room facing Michigan and Wacker in the distance.    Lovely view, esp. at night when the top of the Tribune tower changes color.  The bathroom is smaller than I remember it to be, but no matter.  We are usually out and about.  My only complaint is that the bathroom doesn't have an exhaust fan.  Love the huge mirror in the bedroom- if I could only get one for my home.  The elevators are a PAIN, esp. during a busy, holiday weekend.  The pool is a must visit because it is gorgeous.  The bath products are now Floris (wonderful herbal scents, made in France, from the UK).",4
2244,"This Chicago hotel is a classic, but had seen better days until the recent renovation of the historic building.  I was in town for a meeting at the property otherwise I probably would have selected somewhere else. When I checked in and the receptionist indicated my room was in the 'historic tower"" I got a chill up my spine.  She most have noticed because she then went on to explain the recent renovation.  While my room on the 17th floor was still a bit oddly shapped, it had in fact been lovingly renovated.  The hotels old signature grill work and other decorative pieces (see the ballrooms) are still in place, but the guest rooms are modern and comfortable.  The pool, if you haven't seen it, is certainly worth a visit.  The hotel location with a door right out to the center of The Magnificent Mile makes its location unbeatable.  With a great new wine bar (serves great wines with nice little cheese, olive or sweet plates), the hotel is once again on my list of favorite historic properties.",4
2245,"Overall, this is a good hotel with an awesome, transit-convenient location.  My 3-day bus pass got plenty of use because of all the buses that stop near this hotel.  We got a great deal on Hotwire for a 3 night stay, which is definitely the way to go.  The major issue was the stupid fan/venting system that would not turn off!  They had a digital thermostat in the room to control the temperature, but even if you turned it ""off"" the vent just keeping running. LOUDLY. As in, 2 of the 3 nights were miserable because there was no sleeping to be had.  Yes, we should have asked the front desk, but the first night I had no idea it wouldn't turn off, the second night I was so exhausted that I just passed out, and the third night we asked the room service guy who said he could call engineering after unsuccessfully trying to turn that damn fan off.  Sigh.  But the room was clean, the bathroom was nice, and everyone we dealt with were super helpful.  One weird thing: They have a little basket of snacks atop the minibar for sale, and mixed in with that, is an ""Intimacy Kit."" I don't know why, but I was a little creeped out by condoms/lube sitting in between snickers and doritos.",3
2246,"Loved, loved, LOVED our stay!  We are Ambassador members, so we expected a lot from the get-go, but the Intercontinental went well above and beyond.  The location is stellar, of course.  Check in was perfectly smooth, we got a nice upgrade to a bigger room in the historic tower (which meant we had a 27th floor view of the beautiful city), and we were treated to the news that internet would be free for our whole stay.  Hooray!  Housekeeping was great, and I really loved the bath products they provided.  One day, we were chillin' in the room and heard a knock on the door.  Avon calling?  Nope, it was a complimentary bottle of wine (I suspect because we had been having issues with our A/C, which they fixed quickly).  Another night, we returned to our room to find a plate of chocolates and two snifters with Bailey's.  I ordered room service at 4 AM just so they could heat up my pre-marathon food, and they had me ready to go in under 15 minutes.  The only minor glitch was a somewhat inattentive server at the bar during our last night.  I was really sad to leave the Intercontinental - can't wait to go back and stay again!",5
2247,"I attended a wedding here this past Saturday night.  I had never been inside this hotel and I have to say that I thought it was beautiful.  The wedding reception was held in the Grand Ballroom, which was a round room.  There was a stairway leading above the room which was open so you could see the second floor.  They had candles all the way around the stairway and the second landing.  It was just gorgeous with the low lit room.  The tables were beautiful and they had festive red wine goblets since it is so close to Christmastime.  The food was absolutely delectable.  Spicy Pumpkin Curried Soup, next came Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato towers with fresh Basil and Balsamic.  They then served a Raspberry Sorbet and then for the main course, Filet Mignon with Baby Carrots and Asparagus and a side of Risotto.  Being that I am a vegetarian I got a whole plate of that Yummy Risotto.  The wine was delicious and was flowing all night long.  That is why I had to rent a room that night.  No driving for me.  Anyway, I got sticker shock the next morning when I had to pay $50.00 to get my car out of the lot.  I know we are on Michigan Ave. and all, but geez the room had already set me back $300.00.  Anyway, aside from that, what a nice event.  I would recommend for anyone to have a wedding reception there.  Classy, elegant and just a wonderful time!",4
2248,"Not impressed at all!  I have stayed lots of hotels in the city and would NOT return to this one.  Customer service was horrible.  People could barely be bothered to help you...from the front desk to the bar staff.  It was pathetic.  While the historic tower was nice, be careful as they are currently doing renovation, and they begin working very early in the morning, everyday of the week.  Not at all impressed",1
2249,"We got a great deal on this hotel through Hotwire. We were headed to the Shakespeare play and wanted to enjoy a stroll.   Our room was in the new section of the hotel so it missed all of the ambiance that we had heard about from others  It was a nice room with soft sheets and lots of pillows and a decent slice of view of the lake.   My husband and I discussed why we would not rate it higher.  It was lack of customer service.  A bit of a wait at check-in but not horrible. Okay we can get past that but here is what is missing...detail.   We valet check the car and have a great guy, super friendly, chatting with us but no detail on how to get the car.  My husband had called about the valet service for the car but were not told that it was going to be  $54 for the night which seems a bit pricey but.  When we checked in we questioned where is the fitness center and got the info but again no detail on the fact that there is a fee.  Truthfully we felt sorry for the Fitness Center staff person because she caught the grief of numerous people who were surprised that there was a fee...just bad customer service.  Yes, the gorgeous pool is free and that is a bonus. We check the suitcase after we check out and get the warm fuzzies from the bell stand and were assured that we would be taken care of but when we get the suit case we are surprised tht the car was downstairs and spent awhile waiting downstairs for it...seemed like they could have had it all set up without wasting our time.   The $7.00 fee for the Evian bottle and the $14.00 fee for the internet and all of the pricey bar stuff were laughable.   Eno the wine/cheese bar is a four star.  The staff person was spectacular.  She really knew so much detail about the wine and cheese and helped us  make a great choice on the wine and  the cheese. The Zest menu for brunch was not memorable.  Yes, the food was okay and the service was great but it's Chicago and we expected a lot more. However, the old tower has some beautiful views and architecture.  So grab  a glass of wine and wander...",3
2250,after shopping this is the perfect place to crash. i stayed here one night and didnt want to come home! the pool is ginormus! and the beds are so soft. i had like i a presidential suite...good times,4
2251,"Worst hotel I have ever been to... I would have rather stayed in a dinky motel than this place ever again. The service was terrible, parking is mad expensive, I felt like I paid for a Tiffany's and got a Walmart. The woman on guest services was always  in a rush to get off the phone. The pool closes way too early and that is the only good thing about the hotel. Our room was uncomfortable, they crammed a sofa in there which was a complete waste of space considering we didn't have any leg room between our bed and the sofa. The bathroom was pathetic for a four star hotel and worst of all the toilet seat had brown ""stuff"" on it still ... grossed me out so much. Our tv didn't work so they had to send someone to fix it.... The guy was the only nice person we talked to at the hotel. We got this hotel for my fiancé bday and it really put a damper on our minivacation.",2
2252,This was barely a three star. The only redeeming quality was the comfy bed. I got the historic tower aka old. It was terrible. I couldn't even look out the window because it was a little square window over my head. It was more like a prison window. You also have to pay for the gym which is cool but they should tell you ahead if time so you don't need to go up and down the elevator to gain access. Very disappointed.,1
2253,"I have never stayed here, but I frequent the hotel bar often.  The martinis are very expensive, but they have the best complimentary olives and nuts I have ever had.  I just come here for the olives!!!!",4
2254,"This was a top contender for our wedding.  The ballrooms are beautiful.  The packages were definitely on the high end of our budget but they were not  too outrageous as far as downtown hotel wedding package rates go...  We worked with Chris and thought he was very good - friendly, responsive - a good salesman.  The main reason we did  not select this hotel for our wedding was that the room rates were too high for the dates we were looking at.  At least half of our guests are coming in from out of town so we needed to find room rates that were a bit more affordable.  Otherwise - a great spot!",4
2255,"work brought our satellite location crew into town for the weekend and everyone camped out at the Intercontinental. i was lucky to have gotten to stay here since i am local but i summed it up as a comped staycation. the hotel is really two hotels. i stayed in the tower and i saw both sections, and like it better than the newer section. the hotel offers commanding views of downtown so opt for the highest floor possible. throughout the course of the weekend i had fully explored the entire hotel. a few of us at at their zest restaurant. it was quiet and had a very american menu with nothing too ambitious. while it was expensive, the quality of the food and service unfortunately did not match the price. ENO on the other hand was very nice. their impressive wine list was deciphered with ease by their knowledgable waiter and glasses were complimented by some of the finest cheeses i have ever tasted. i felt very relaxed because the atmosphere was not pretentious. i believe the menu might have had a few sandwiches but we didn't try them.",4
2256,"My husband was in town for a 2week project and this was the ""recommended"" hotel by his customer base on its location.  He called the hotel to book the reservation and was routed to the 800 reservation desk.  We could get the room for less but ended up paying $40 more per night and was told so we would have free internet and free access to the gym.  When we showed up for our room and learned that there's a promotion going where you paid $25/night  on top of your regular room rate and you would get free internet, free access to the gym, free breakfast and free calls for the entire stay.  We felt we were mislead by the reservation desk and tried to talk to the front desk to add the breakfast to our package.  We were told the 800 reservation center is a third party company they use so whatever the deal we get from them has nothing to do with the hotel.  We were dumb founded by the remarks made by the front desk staff and felt although it is a decent hotel, we would not recommend to anyone.",2
2257,"Ahhh, Marriott chain, I have come to really appreciate you! * Firm mattresses * Great pillows * An awesome city view from our 31st floor room * Super early check-in availability, which we were not expecting at all * Flavored ice water in the lobby * Yummy Bath & Body Works products in the bathroom (they smell like Fresh Sugar) * Full Starbucks location in the lobby * FedEx location on the second floor * Bar in the lobby Even though your bedside outlets are only accessible by moving the bedside drawers, we had no fridge in the room, and the water pressure in the shower is pretty low, I'm still a fan!",4
2258,"We had a pre-wedding dinner party at the Marriott on Michigan Ave, and we were absolutely floored by the extraordinary level of commitment shown by every member of the Marriott staff. Kristina Cappazoli helped us plan out our event, and was amazing right from the get go. Each time we interacted with her, we felt more confident that the dinner would go well -- and it did! We continue to get compliments from our guests on how wonderful everything was -- the food, the ambiance, the service. It all added up to an unforgettable night, and we owe thanks to Kristina for helping us make it happen. Special shout out to Cheryl B, the amazingly talented pastry chef who designed our wedding cake. She came up with some excellent designs, and was willing to adapt to our tastes and preferences. More than one guest came up and told us it was the best wedding cake they had ever tasted. If you have to plan an event in the Chicago downtown area -- I'd wholeheartedly recommend the Marriott, especially if you get to work with Kristina and Cheryl!",5
2259,"GREAT location, that's worth it in itself. Clean rooms, comfy beds. They have a nice bar in the middle of the lobby, and a Starbucks as well. Our concierge (Matthew, I believe) was incredibly accommodating and gave us a jump the line (and free appetizer) coupon to Gino's East (YUM), which was much appreciated by an out of towner like myself. This Marriott is walking distance from tons of shopping (Zara, Topshop, H&M, etc) and dining spots. I would definitely stay here again.",4
2260,"Good hotel, great location and nice on-property amenities for business (FedEx Office, Starbucks).",4
2261,The hotel is a great location on the Magnificent Mile and across the street from Nordstom's!  Praise the lord the Marriott Downtown hotel had the availability since I was scheduled to have my event at the JW Marriott (ahem Legionnaire's disease - no thanks!).  Anyway it all worked out the catering & hotel staff is top notch here.  Everyone is super friendly and helpful.  Plus they have an abundance of meeting space.  The hotel rooms are small and needs updating.  But who's complaining...this hotel is great for meetings.,4
2262,"I was extremely surprised that i was checked into a room #2107 friday 5/25/2012 where the room was hotter than outside 80 degrees, smelled like old wet carpet and when you turn the light on you can see the dust on the desk and on frames etc . The desk the LCD was on was chipped. I felt like i was in a motel 6. The blue chair, it was white smugges/stuff on it. I'm thinking this can't be happening. This must be a bad dream. Wow! Now don't get me wrong love the Marriott and I have stayed in some of the Marriott hotels in different cities. But this is a first I experienced this at the Marriott especially downtown and I'm still in shock. I called their front desk/ays dept and informed them it seem like no one hasn't stayed in this room for a while.Even though  I had turned on the room temperature 50 degrees at 7pm, at 4am the next morning it still felt like it was 85 degrees in that hotel room. The gentleman front desk/ays dept stated that if i would like to have an engineer to come and fix it. I'm thinking at 4am in the morning and my fiance and I will have to get up and put cloths on because they placed us in a room they knew was not used in months and that the air condition didn't work. So i said no, because it's going to be an inconvenience and checkout is at 11am so I stated that it wouldn't help. The gentleman explained to me that the building is old and needs some minor repairs and he apologizes. I'm thinking WOW!!!! But then, an Express checkout/bill was placed under my door. LOL!!!! But I was not offered and continential breakfast or a refund or anything. LOL!! Wow!!! Not even an room change was offered. Lmao!!! I know this is not the type of service that Mr. Marriott will ever agree with. Mr. Marriott always has pride his self and the corporation on cleanliness and providing exceptional service and great customer service.",1
2263,"If you are a type A personality do not stay here. You will find things about this hotel that bother you and you can't figure out how to make it not bother you. I stayed for 4 nights on the 38 floor and went to a conference at the courtyard Marriott down the street. Pros: Wifi worked all over the hotel for me There is a Starbucks in the hotel (with limited hrs of 6 am to 8 pm) Great location on the strip, especially with all the new stores popping up on the street Room service was super nice and generous (although food sucked but since when has room service ever had good food?!) Morning concierge staff was nice and helpful Air conditioner worked GREAT on the hot nights I was there Huge workout room Cons: Room did not have the most pleasant smell (smelt like feet) Infrequent hot water availability (I wear a pliable splint that needs to be heated up and had to sleep one night without it) A wet pillow case was left in the room by cleaning service Check-in concierge was extremely rude Overall, the hotel was in an amazing spot! I won't lie, it was nice when I went shopping and had a quick stop in between. But in reality, I felt like I was at a super 8 or something of that caliber. There was one morning when I left (8am) and before my door even closed, a cleaning staff member jumped in to start cleaning the room. I understand you have a job to do but at least wait until the door is closed and use the room key! Warning, if you are not a big fan of noisy lobbies then stay clear of here. The hotel bar is in an atrium and all noise there is amplified. I didn't mind it but in the morning it was strange. If you have stayed with Marriott before, you might be disappointed. If you simply don't care about much in a hotel, stay here...you'll be fine and won't care about the same things us anal-type a personalities do!",2
2264,"One of my favorite hotels in CHI- it's your standard cookie cutter Marriott as far as the rooms are concerned, but the location is excellent, right in the middle of Michigan Ave. Also, the staff are really friendly, a cut about the standard Marriott. Lastly, the concierge lounge is pretty big and serves up a good spread. Overall, a good place to stay in downtown unless you want to spring for the Westin.",4
2265,"I stayed at this hotel for a conference the week of June 4. The conference facilities are nice, and what one would expect from a hotel located in a downtown district. The rooms were clean, and updated with a contemporary look. The lobby is large and open. The pros: -location -staff is very helpful and friendly -lobby bar is lively and serves decent drinks The cons: -the wifi access throughout the facility is spotty and extremely cumbersome. Being there for a conference, I was also working. I needed reliable access for the multiple devices I travel with. One can login as a guest in one's room, but when one tries to login on the conference levels, the same network is either unavailable or unusable. Same is true when trying to access via the lobby -- there is a separate network, apparently, for each of these areas. My iPhone was virtually unusable via wifi outside of my room, same for my iPad. The 3G access is awful as well. Text messages between myself and a colleague (also staying at the same hotel) were spotty -- either not arriving at all or taking several minutes to arrive. If you're considering staying here as a business traveler, I would recommend one of the many other options in the immediate vicinity. Obviously, based on the above, I place a premium on broadband internet access which has colored this review. Fast, reliable access is a must for me and the hotel fell woefully short in this regard. That said, it was a perfectly acceptable experience outside of the wifi issues, and based on the moderate price, might be a good choice for those looking for a room in the heart of the magnificent mile. There is extremely easy walking access to multiple great restaurants, and the art institute is just a nice stroll down Michigan Ave away.",2
2266,"I try and stay here every June for The World Trade Fair - NEOCON. It's the perfect location right on Michigan Avenue (NR Wacker) where all the shops start and right next to Nordstrom also walkable to the Merchandise Mart. The rooms are small, but comfortable for one person on a business trip for a couple of nights. Very comfortable beds and bedding. The customer service I found to be good. The AC was leaking in the floor outside the bathroom in my room and the carpet was wet. The maintenance guy was up within 10 minutes with the bell boy with rugs and asking if I wanted to switch rooms.",4
2267,"We had our September 24, 2011 wedding at the Marriott on Michigan Avenue and I cannot say enough great things about the staff we worked with. From the inital planning stages of our wedding to the day of the big event and even days later, I could not be happier with the service we received from everyone we crossed paths with. The bellmen were friendly and helpful. Maintenance and housekeeping accommodated all of our extra requests, the bartenders and wait staff were quick, courteous, and efficient. Special shout out to Amy Stage and Kristina Cappazoli from the Event Planning team. They are both so great at their jobs and they made the process of planning a wedding painless and ENJOYABLE. their knowledge, expertise, and willingness to go above and beyond made our wedding so spectacular. We still to this day get compliments from guests on how wonderful the food was at our cocktail hour and reception. People who say wedding food can't be elegant and delicious haven't eaten at a wedding here. We had four dinner options and all were fantastic and delicious - the horseradish crusted salmon was succulent, the filet of beef was perfectly cooked and paired with the most amazing red onion confit, the cranberry cornbread stuffed chicken breast was juicy, and the vegetarian paella was a hit with my vegetarian and vegan friends. SERIOUSLY, the entrees and sides were the best I've had at a wedding to date, and i'm not just saying that because it was my wedding. One last shout out to Cheryl B, the amazing and talented pastry chef. She made the most beautiful and delicious 5 tier wedding cake with three different cake flavors and fillings. The cakes were moist and tender while the fillings and buttercream were light, fluffy and delicious.",5
2268,"Had a great weekend in Chicago; hotel location is perfect, but that's about all it has going for it.  Room wasnt ready till 5pm on check in day.  First room was moldy smelling; walls are paper thin, lobby is bright, loud, and uninviting, pool is fun, but tiny. room AC not up to par.   Bill- the GM - appears to have no sense of customer service/customer satisfaction skills.  WIll definitely try another hotel next time, and would not recommend this. I expected more - Very disappointed for a Marriott",1
2269,"We stay in a Marriott over 200 nights a year and this is by far the worst we have been to! We were checked into a dirty as well as awful smelling room. Then we called to get a new room and it took them almost an hour to find us one and kept telling us to wait in a room that smelled so bad I was getting a headache. Then they only activated out keys for one night so we we went all the way up to our room the second day for the key to not work. We took it down and the manager was extremely rude!!!! The only thing he could say was and I quote ""I hope it gets better for you."" Everyone here is rude but the manager was by far the worst. we would never stay here again and we would never recommend it. The rooms weren't even that great. Next time we are in Chicago we will definitely be staying at the JW Marriott.  This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.",1
2270,"We stayed here last weekend for the IGI gymnastics girls meet and they catered to us very well.  The staff was great - and I mean everyone I encountered or talked to were very attentive and responsive to any needs we had.  They not only answered our questions but they also engaged in real conversations like real people.  Very impressive. The three star rating is only because I have been to much nicer, bigger and newer hotels.  One thing that really did bother us was that the pool smelled very strong of Chlorine.  I know they have to keep it at high levels but this burned my nose and throat just walking onto the floor it was on.  It was so bad we decided to not let our daughter swim in it. Valet parking was expensive but then again this is Chicago and it was expected.  The Valet service is super at this hotel. I ordered a pizza from room service and while it was not the best pizza I have had it was also not the worst.   All in all this is a nice place to stay.  Just don't swim.",3
2271,"If I would have typed a review for the Marriott a year ago I might have given it 5 stars, but this last trip wasn't all that great. I spent thanksgiving here, and it was just a ok. I was a little turned off being able to hear other guests peeing in their bathroom, the concierge loung was closed for 2 days which REALLY bummed me out, we usually hang out there in the evenings, and play games....but nope not this time, I love the location, but standards weren't up to par. Why is there no free WI-FI???? only downstairs ?? Not cool Over all the stay was so so, I'd like a little better stay for the money we spent to sleep here.",3
2272,"We stayed here for a couple days and if I wanted to be centered in this area again, I'd do it again. But super touristy is not my thing. I'd rather not dodge suitcases with children sitting on them while trying to get outside. You look at other reviews on here and think the bathrooms must be small. If you've ever lived in a one bedroom apartment, you'll enter your room and then laugh. Seriously no different than any bathrooms I've ever had in an apartment, why would you expect anything more in a hotel room? The room itself was great, we had a view over Michigan Avenue on the 36th floor. The bed was so comfortable, and we had plenty of space. Also pretty sure any reviews complaining about elevators are VERY outdated. There are 6 ""low-rise"" elevators that go to the 28th floor and then 6 for the higher level floors. There was almost always one sitting in the lobby to head up, and if there wasn't, you barely had to wait...unless you were the idiots who weren't aware you had to press the button and not just stare at it because you don't have elevator buttons on your farm in Iowa. If you're logical enough not to bring a car here, there are so many buses that come right nearby and it's an easy walk to many different places. Concierge lounge was pretty meh. The drinks were hardly discounted like they are elsewhere (wow, a whole $11 for a cocktail instead of $13 down at the regular bar!). The breakfast wasn't that impressive either and we ended up going elsewhere for it after morning #1. The bar was always pretty busy, we only went there on Christmas for a drink before dinner. They have a couple local beers on tap, which is awesome and they really want you to know they make their blue cheese stuffed olives for martinis.",4
2273,"I was staying at the Marriot for a conference in October 2011. I brought my wife along for a little mini-vacation. Checkin was smooth. Our room on the 15th floor was clean, small, but quite serviceable. The bathroom fan was either missing or inoperable. That was the only thing I found 'broken'. The bed was quite confortable and the blackout drape very welcome. There were really no complaints about the room... but for this: Being a geek I was surprised that wireless was only available on the first few floors not in the rooms. Instead there was a hardwire. The conference comp'd the internet access but I must rant anyway: YOU BLITHERING IDIOTS! In case it had not occurred to you, this is the 21st century. Internet access for most of us is not an 'optional' luxury. WTF is your problem Marriot nickel and dime'ing people for net access? I'd trade the f'in TV access straight across for the net access. No mini-bar, not that cared. We requested a fridge for my wife's medications and it was in the room when we arrived. Very nice. The front desk staff, concierge, and bellman were all well trained and cordial. The bar downstairs was reasonably priced for a 'hotel' bar. The catered conference food was really not very good. No matter, we ate out most nights as the location of the Marriot is IDEAL for a foodie looking for Chicago good eats All in all a solid 4 star performance. Not super luxury, and still pimping net access, but a solid establishment.",4
2274,"I stayed here when I was on business. The lobby is huge (large bar area in the middle of the lobby). They even have a Starbucks inside the lobby...not a fake coffee only SB's either...a legit SB's with all the fixins. Location:  Very convenient to shopping, restaurants, tourist attractions and a leisurely stroll to the ""loop"" or ""miracle mile"". Rooms:  Their rooms are very cookie cutter when it comes to big cities. But they are definitely bigger than ones in NYC. The bathroom is very tight quarters...door hit the toilet, yeah, that small. Shower is good size. The rooms are clean and beds comfy. Overall: It's a good place to stay whether on business or pleasure. The bar in the lobby area does charge ""hotel"" alcohol prices but it's spacious and lots of TV's to watch sports...",4
2275,"If you're not use to city noise,this might not be the best choice for you. You could here sirens all night long. Also no WIFI in the room... Really? It's 2011 Marriott. this is a dated property for Marriott but you can't beat a location on the Magnificent Mile",2
2276,I stayed here for a total of 8 nights during a recent work trip. We had a room block so the rates were decent (around $200/night). The location is really convenient since it's on Magnificent Mile with shops and restaurants within a short walking distance. The rooms are average.  Clean.  Nothing that spectacular.,3
2277,"Attended several meetings in this hotel and would have to say: ""meh, I've experienced better."" Although the rooms, lightening and acoustics were positive the food is nothing to get excited over. If you need to hold a business function and want to impress, please consider another establishment. Good luck!",2
2278,"LOCATION is the best part of the hotel. GREAT location. Walking distance to some great restaurants (which was key for me because I spent a week here for a conference that did not serve food so I was on my own for every meal - and I hate hotel food). The bar/lobby area was AWESOME too - totally vibrant, lots of people, nice vibe. I brought my laptop down there because I had no WiFi in my room - which is my #1 complain with this hotel. I can't remember the last time I was at a hotel where I had to plug my laptop into an outlet! #FAIL My other complaint is the cable - hardly any channels - no Bravo, no VH1 - I look forward to business trips because I can watch some trashy reality TV and decompress from stressful days. But not here. However, the fitness center is GREAT! Weight room and an aerobic room! One of the best I've ever seen. Which is great because I ate my way through Chicago!",3
2279,"I spent a week at the Marriott recently for a conference, staying, eating, and drinking here for 5 days. There is a lot about the hotel that is good -- even wonderful. But there are also some downsides. The front desk, concierge, and bell staff are phenomenal. They are friendly, attentive, and move the seemingly endless lines very quickly. They are that same combination of assertive and nice that characterizes most Chicagoans, and they remind me why I fell in love with Chicago in the first place so long ago. The maid staff falls into this category as well, when you run into them, and everyone of these people deserve a hefty tip and a round of applause. The lobby showcases Rush bar, a rushed place that is constantly packed with patrons and guests of the hotel, and the staff flurries about as quickly as possible, slinging overpriced drinks while holding a terse smile and their breath. I can't blame them for their stress, but they need a few extra helpers on hand. The rooms are basic but nice. No flat screens or iPod docks to be found, but the beds are comfortable, and the blankets are plentiful. I asked to be on an upper floor and was given a room on the 39th, with a lake view, which was lovely. However, the windows either don't seal well or are too thin, because it seems there is no sound dampening at all between you and the Magnificently loud Mile at your feet. The detractions I have for the hotel are more on the conference side. The food, while pricey, is supremely bland. I had salmon one night, chicken the next, and a vegetarian dish the following, and they all tasted exactly the same. I found this disturbing, to say the least. In addition, the conference rooms are freezing. When you are sitting on your duff for 8 to 9 hours a day, your circulation needs a bit of help from the temp gauges, and these rooms do not afford it. Bring a coat. Better yet, bring a sleeping bag. I would stay here again, but I would not plan another event here. I recommend it for a pleasure trip to the city. The location can't be beat, and the surrounding shops, restaurants, and walkable places are worth every dime.",3
2280,"We booked our room here through a Priceline bid process, so we did not pick it, but we got a single night for a room for two for $90 plus taxes and fees, which we thought was a stellar deal! As other Yelpers mention, the location of this hotel is absolutely the best quality about it. We had excellent train access to Wrigley Field and could walk to wonderful restaurants as well as waterfront activities. Getting out of Chicago in the morning was super efficient, driving down Ontario to I-94 for freeway access. We did have some trouble getting to the valet parking entry when we first arrived, as that entry is on Rush street, and when we went past it, it took us awhile, with the one-way streets and the river, to loop back around. The lobby is incredibly busy and hopping, but even so, we managed to check in very quickly on a Sunday. We also had access to our room before the posted check-in time, which was a wonderful treat. We had a room on a  high floor with a king bed, but we didn't have views of the lake (ask for that!). The room was not large, but it had everything we needed and was beautifully appointed and very comfortable. In fact, overnight I was sick with a migraine and throwing up, and this is the one time in my life when such suffering away from home did NOT make me wish to be home in my own bed. Everything was very comforting and comfortable. Again, I noticed this Marriott did not include a hairdryer in the room. (I've noticed this recently in Marriott properties.) I brought my own, so I did not mind. Also, the WiFi is NOT included in the room price. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, which we appreciated, and we found all the staffers to be very professional, energetic and attentive. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I have the opportunity.",4
2281,"This review is specifically for the fifth floor banquet hall.. If you know you will be attending a meeting or symposium here, I highly suggest you swing by Starbucks beforehand to get your favorite drink in a Venti cup and a big yummy pastry to get you through the morning, because I'm sorry, Marriott - dry apple strudels and a choice between house blend or decaf is not my idea of a quality breakfast. When you're competing with places like the Union League Club, which serves three-course meals to its conference attendees, that's just embarrassing. Also, bring a sweater - the banquet hall is cold!",2
2282,"I stayed at the Chicago Marriott Downtown on the Mag Mile during a recent business trip to the Chicago area.  The lobby area of the hotel is very nice and a wonderful mix of modern and classy.  The bar is pretty nice and for a hotel restaurant, the restaurant within the hotel was pretty good.  Plus, there is a Starbucks in the lobby. Additionally, the location almost cannot be beat.  It's on Michigan Avenue in the heart of almost everything.  You have a great view of the city, you can walk just about everywhere, and it is possible to have a lake view as well. The rooms are an average size, but the bathrooms are tiny.  And by tiny, I mean European tiny.  Look I'm a guy and I don't really need a lot from a bathroom, but when I can barely stand in the bathroom and close the door... then the bathroom is way too small.  Plus, the shower was super weak in water pressure output. The sheets and bed were comfortable and a nice size.  i'm only 5'9"", so I don't need a king bed... and probably couldn't tell you whether I was in a king bed or queen.  They're both more than enough bed for me. Overall, I had a nice stay.",4
2283,"Spent a week here for a work conference and extended for a girls' trip for a couple days.  Very convenient location. Shops, bars, restaurants are all within walking distance.  Taxis came quickly.  Service was friendly and helpful.   The rooms were decent; bathroooms were a little smaller than I would have liked (hey, I was sharing with another woman!).   The fact that they had a real, full-on Starbucks in the lobby was a HUGE plus.  To me, nothing is worse than having to attend day after day of a grueling national sales meeting with bad coffee.  Every day started off right here!!!  A bar being in the center of the lobby meant you were never far away from a cocktail the second work was done, either.   I haven't stayed anywhere else in downtown Chicago so I don't have much to compare it to in the city but it was a great location at a decent price for a big city.",4
2284,"It's definitely right in the heart of downtown Chicago shopping.  Lobby is very nice with lots of seating witha bar and Starbucks.   Rooms are very small and the bathroom even smaller.  I rated 3 stars because it was just an OK hotel, certainly nothing to write home about!",3
2285,"I should say that I type this on behalf of me and only me in case anyone knows me or figures out my organization :-) My experience with the Marriott was absolutely exceptional in terms of event planning. I work for a nonprofit organization that chose to move its fundraising gala to the Marriott from another Chicago hotel. Being a new venue, and ne to the organization and planning this particular event the combination of Amy (Sales Manager) and Christina (Event planner - I don't think that's her exact title) made everything easy and seemless. They were wondreful to work with and the night-of, Christina practically bent over backwards to go the extra mile for us, that's for sure! I really can't say enough nice things- from the tasting to the planning to settling the bill, everything went very smoothly. I woudl say if you're planning an event (conference, dinner, wedding, etc.) this is a good bet. The location is perfect for those who work/live downtown and for those visiting. It's pretty much in the heart of everything. The recent rennovation has made the hotel very colorful and modern, yet still very tasteful. The ballrooms can be modern, elegant, whatever you want them to be. The dinner was amazing and if you get a chance, be sure to include the desserts all made by hand. They are absolutely to die for! Best pastry chef ever! Apparently, everything is made in the hotel and is locally sourced as much as possible. The hotel even has its own butcher shop. I'm going to stop now because I'm starting to sound like an ad. If it balances out the review a little, I will say that the rooms were nice, but not exceptional. You had everything that you needed including a nice big bathroom, but otherwise, I would say they were pretty average. Great views, though. Ok, now I'm done.",5
2286,"Location, location, location! My cousin and I recently stayed here for 3 nights on a weekend getaway trip. Because of the popular location we didn't need to rent a car. It was adjacent to The Shops at North Bridge, public transportation (bus/subway), taxi stands, restaurants, and pretty much anything you could possibly need. The lobby was always full of people since there is a bar and a Starbucks. After the first two nights we switched from a fairly small, yet comfortable and clean room to a bigger hospitality suite. It was basically a standard room with an adjacent living room (bonus Murphy bed we didn't use), a small kitchenette and two flat screens. Both of our rooms had spectacular views of the lake from the 44th floor. Being the needy gals we are, Concierge, the Elite desk and the front desk staff always took fantastic care of us, providing disposable razors, extra rooms keys, shuttle to O'Hare, etc. And the turn down service was a nice perk. Thanks for the chocolates.",4
2287,"The Marriott had some really great plusses, especially location-wise, but I just wasn't a huge fan given these reasons: 1) Rooms were small with full sized beds. 2) I hated the fact they had two sets elevators - one that went to the higher floors and another set that went from 1-28. I'm sure there is an excellent logistical reason for why they did that, but it was a pain if we wanted to visit other people in our party. 3) No mini-fridge in OUR room at least (we found others had mini-fridges in their rooms) but their rooms had one bed as opposed to two? Perhaps that was the difference? 4) Small bathrooms. Not to mention, our toilet kept running the entire night. 5) We had luke-warm water the last morning we were there. 6) SMALL pool with a smaller fitness center (but the weight room was located in a different location which was quite spacious). Though all in all, the Marriott was a pretty nice place to stay. They had a real Starbucks in their lobby (but its not 24 hour). Free wifi on the 2nd floors and lobby. The food offered in the hotel was also REALLY good. We had a banquet there and the food was exceptional. They utilize farm fresh products and even have beehives on the roof, producing their own honey! Not to mention, the LOCATION was absolutely amazing. We were within walking distance of the art institute of chicago, the bean, as well other great Chicago attractions (ahem the food?!).",3
2288,"We stay here every year in May for the NRA show. (National restaurant Association) Great location, right downtown. The lobby is huge - lots of activity with people socializing, etc. The rooms are a bit small, but not bothersome. Work out room is good as well. The bar has great appetizers and drinks. And the staff is all very helpful. The Federal Express office could of been better. We had a package we were waiting for, we walked down to see if it had arrived. nope. We tried a few times, nothing. Finally we said we need to put a trace, they said they would. They didn't. So we did. We went back down to the office - a regional fed ex guy was there, heard our story and started to help us. It got delivered to another hotel next door. So he walked over there with us. All is good. we got our package. But then we got a call at 3:00 AM, from fed. express saying they were still looking for our package. So apparently after he left us - he didn't finish up with his own company and let them know we found it. (Maybe more training is needed - all the way up the ladder.) But they are apart from the Marriott - so for this review. We will stay again in this Marriott, just as we have been for the last 10 years.",4
2289,"This one goes out to Chicagoan, Caroline A...  Who may soon become a New Yorker. Thanks to JetBlue delaying our flight from 8PM to 3AM, we finally arrived at our hotel by 6AM.  Although we had reservations, we were told we were lucky that 2 rooms were still available due to the Air & Water Show that weekend. Minutes later, we walk into our room...  Seriously?  No, really?? Yes, I'm tired...  Is this dream?  C'mon now! Our entire Marriott Downtown Chicago, Magnificent Mile room, including bathroom & closet, could have fit in the master bathroom of our J.W. Marriott Summerlin room in Las Vegas!  See review & photos: http://www.yelp.com/biz/…  In fact, our bathroom in Chicago is smaller than most of the bathrooms I've seen in Manhattan!  The door cannot swing open more than 45 degrees because the bathtub gets in the way! *Split second flashback to my hotel in Japan* Well, the view has got to be good, right? The window spans the width of the room & measure approximately 5'5"" in height.  The view isn't breathtaking & it certainly helps that we're more than 20 stories up.  The glass only slides open about 2"". You guessed it.  We're paying for location -- Step one foot out of the hotel's revolving doors & you're on Magnificent Mile. Yay: Spacious, tasteful lobby.  Nice curtains & sleek lamps. Nay: Tacky hallway carpeting.  No fridge, mini-bar snacks or safe. The lone, liter bottle of Evian in the room will cost you $5. 24 hours of internet will run you $14.95 The outdoor roof area is under construction until October 2007. We decided to extend our stay in Chicago past the weekend, BUT I could not tolerate the lack of space another minute!  We moved to the Sofitel nearby, but only after I inspected our room first.",2
2290,"While I have not stayed in the hotel, I recently attended a conference here and was amazed by the level of service. These people do it right and are extremely helpful and friendly.  The conference was on floors 6 and 7 and it seemed that there was a member of staff to help navigate at every turn.  The breakfast spread looked yummy and the coffee stayed on all day.  The boxed lunch was more than enough food and done very efficiently. After the conference, I was even able to get some work done in the lobby, using their free wi-fi. I would gladly recommend this hotel for any corporate event.",4
2291,Stayed here again for a business trip.  Still a 3-star review. It's a standard Marriott with all the basic and necessity.   Few things during this stay: 1) No TV remote in room 2) Shower didn't work for the first room 3) New room - no hot water for the shower,3
2292,"Oh Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... I love your 300 thread count Signature linens that gave me a restful and comfy sleep. And your towels that didn't smell funky. I love your adoption of Mayor Daley's green initiative by housing 200,000 honey bees on your rooftop to produce honey for the hotel and sell to hotel guests. I love your registration clerk Melissa who gave us a fabulous room on the 39th floor that provided an amazing view of the lake. I love your house made potato chips cooked fresh daily. I REALLY love your homemade pickles that have a banana pepper zip to them. I love your close proximity to everything Chicago! No rental of a car needed. We walked everywhere. Front entrance is on Rush. Back entrance is smack dab on Michigan Avenue. Close to the river. Within walking distance to Navy Pier and Millennium Park. I love your lobby bar and the loungey, comfy furniture where we would partake of a nightcap after a day of sightseeing before we hit the hay. Yea, internet is extra and the rooms lack fridges, but you know what? This is a big city. They want you out and about enjoying the sights and sounds; not holed up in your room being a hermit. That's why I love the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile!",4
2293,"This hotel is perhaps the best place to stay for your value. Let me emphasize that I've stayed at a lot of hotels in my time working in Chicago. I've stayed at: Conrad Hotel on Monroe Westin on Michigan Ave Westin on River North Residence Inn on Michigan Courtyard on Grand Palmer House on Monroe This place is still on Michigan Ave, but more like in the middle. It's got Ethel's Chocolate Lounge as a neighbor. You can get to any restaurant you want from this location. I stayed for a full 6 weeks and my room was always clean and neat when I arrived and cleaned well when I returned, and I'm a slob in hotels. When I had a complaint about charges to my room they were promptly taken off without a lot of hassle. Kudos to this hotel. This is where I wish I had stayed all the time.",5
2294,"Well if you looking for clean motel with a nice lobby bar then this is your place, but you might have got that for a lot cheaper at a Motel 6. Look here is the story if you are any type of a business person don't expect to have WiFi in your room only in the lobby. Come on folks it is 2011, which resulted in me trying to use my Verizon Cell phone hot spot which was also horrible. Let see if that fails maybe I can watch a little TV, woops again no HD TV signel, no menu on the remote this can't be it is 2011. So if you want and expensive place to stay with no electronic abilities then this is your place.",2
2295,"There is one word to describe this hotel.  Functional, at best.   As a business traveler who stays at Marriot's all over the world- this hotel is just okay in my book.  Now granted- they are in the process of remodeling and they will have another chance to impress me when I stay here again in July, but for now?  Functional is the best I can say. From the time you pull up to the entrance- and you wait and wait and wait for the valet to come and get your car- to the mess in the lobby from the remodeling (bang, bang, bang!) to the front desk staff who acted like they were bothered that I was there, this place needs a major overhaul. The guest rooms are small and the one I was in had not yet been remodeled so it felt tired and old.  Room service for simple items took forever and no one ever did show up with the extra blanket that I requested. I also attended a banquet here and although the space was large and remodeled, there are certainly better banquet facilities in this city.  The banquet food was cold and tasteless and we couldn't get a refill of our water or wine glasses throughout the entire evening.  When we asked for additional rolls because there were not enough for everyone at our table- the server told us that it was ""planned that way"".  What?  They planned to have 5 rolls for a table of 8? On the positive side- this hotel is in a great location at Rush and Ohio close to all that a tourist may want to do in our fine city.   But as for me?  I think I'll let them finish their remodeling and give it another shot this summer to see if the ""facelift"" that they are doing goes deeper than just the surface.",3
2296,"My brother used to stay at this location on business and he recommended it to me and although you pay a little extra for the area, its still an okay price. The bar is very well stocked, the service was friendly and quick to serve and the seats were very comfortable. But since its in a big open space and near the side entrance it can get chilly sat there if the heat isn't cranked up at night. I wish the Starbucks was open a little later, but with so many others surrounding the hotel, its a minor complaint. I was a fan of the restaurant- both breakfast and dinner was delicious but its was rather overpriced. The gym was perfect both in stock, cleanliness and smell. The wi-fi 'deals' apparently improved vastly since the refurb so that no longer effects my rating. And of course the room itself, was...well standard Marriott. Big comfy bed with plenty of extra pillows and blankets and the bathroom had a pretty decent shower. It was among the cleanest hotels I've ever stayed in and the friendliest. Will definitely recommend this location to my mother (and shes even pickier than me!) if she visits me late next year.",4
2297,"I was impressed with the Chicago Marriott Downtown on several counts. * Perfect location * Amazing concierge service * Comfortable beds * Extensive health club equipment * Kick-ass lobby The location simply can't be beat.  Halfway between Water Tower and the Loop on Michigan Avenue means that the hotel is suited for business travelers, shoppers and tourists.  And since it's adjacent to Grand you're a few blocks away from the Red Line and along the free trolley route to Navy Pier.   Again, the location is simply unbeatable.   The concierge service was awesome.  They went above and beyond with helpful tips for sightseeing, restaurant recommendations/reservations, and even brought up a phone charger to my room for my use. The beds and down comforters were quite the highlight.  I overslept a few times, and like to think this was the reason. While the pool and hot tub were standard and ordinary, I was surprised to find how awesome the health club was.  I expected to find three treadmills, two barbells and a situp contraption.   To my delight I found a cardio room of 20 machines, and a completely separate free weight area with about 40 machines, barbells and dumbbells -- in a hotel??  That's almost as good as any nearby gym. And, yes, the lobby is busy, well appointed and not too stuffy.  Tons,of plush furniture flanked by a bar, Starbucks, and the busy din of travelers milling about. While there are better hotels in the area (Park Hyatt, Peninsula, Drake, etc.), we all can't afford that - so this is a good compromise.  All in all, it was a postive experience in a recommended hotel.  I would stay here again. My only complaints would be the general noise and loudness of the area, the hotel's lack of WiFi and the cramped hotel room bathrooms.  Even being 43 stories up, the noise of the streets below still felt a bit loud at times.  For a popular convention hotel such as this not to have free WiFi is kind of embarrassing.  The bathrooms are TINY.  I couldn't even open and shut the door without completely maneuvering around the sink and toilet.  This bathroom rivals NYC for petiteness.",4
2298,"A must-stop on your Magnificent Mile shopping if you gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-go-right-now. The perfect blend of clean hotel bathroom, busy lobby so-you-won't-get-noticed-by-anyone environmental distraction, and not-quite-attentive-enough doormen/bellstaff who won't bother you about using their facilities. Highly recommended.",4
2299,"We stayed here over the past weekend for a wedding.  We got a sweet discount for wedding guests, which was really the only reason we could afford to stay here.   The good: - LOCATION!  We were able to walk everywhere, which was great - Starbucks and bar in the lobby - the view! Our 39th floor room had a lakeview, and floor to ceiling windows with which to appreciate it.  It was by far the best view I have ever had in a hotel.   - Our room was comfortable (king size bed), flat-screen tv, good water pressure, no smells - the elevators are fast, which is great when you are up almost 40 stories The bad: - would have liked a mini fridge and free internet, but no one is perfect - the tv lost the cable signal for about an hour; however, there was a pretty severe thunderstorm going on (of course, that's why we wanted to watch tv and see the weather...) - parking was difficult.  We opted to do the off-site garage parking for $33/night (expensive, but what can you expect downtown?).  The first garage next to the hotel we pulled into was full, but made us pay $6 to get out. Gee, thanks.  We accidentally went by the next one, and when we tried to just do a lap around the block, we got stuck behind a parade that had shut down most of the area.  So it took us about an hour to turn around and get back to the hotel to park again.  The validation process was easy, however.  But next time we will probably just pay the extra to valet.   If we can afford it, we would definitely stay here again on another trip to Chicago.",4
2300,"What a great hotel, located centrally in downtown Chicago, close to any place you'd want to be, all within walking distance, or a really short cabride away. This particular hotel has a lobby that is always packed with people, with a bar and seating areas in the wide open of the lobby with the registration desk tucked away.  The bellboys and concierge folks are friendly - and the the rooms are nice. Their suites were an interesting concept.   A 2 bedroom suite was actually one huge room with bar and a dining area/living area, and a single hotel room attached, sort of like a guestroom.   The views from the 43rd floor was breathtaking  - all of Chicago RIGHT THERE... WAY DOWN BELOW.  Given my fear of heights, this was not the best set up for me, with floor to ceiling windows, but it was indeed beautiful. A little inconvenient was the way their elevators work.  With 6 elevators, you'd think there would be more elevators working the 45 floors, but it always seemed to be my elevator stopping at every floor to pick more people up on the way down.  Strange.... The bathrooms are a bit small for the size of the rooms, and while they had granite countertops, that was the only noteworthy thing.  Toiletries are supplied, and there is a blowdryer if you want.  But no bathrobes or other special items you'd find at what I would consider a 5-star hotel. The bed at Hyatt McCormick was more cushy - but that said - with my back problems, the beds at  this Marriott gave me a better night's sleep and I felt great the next morning, whereas at the Hyatt's bed, I always woke up in pain.  I'm not sure why.... but the Marriott bed was SUPERB for me.  Go figure. The entire hotel is non-smoking, so that should be kept in mind if you smoke.......... Room Service is efficient and fast.  The coffee was actually quite good, served in a thermos, with two glasses of water accompanying it, and arriving within 30 minutes of ordering.  GOOD. In any case, the location can't be beat.   The hotel in itself and the rooms are nice, and the views are fantastic. If staying in Chicago, and you're wanting to be close to the nightlife, restaurants, etc - - this would be an ideal choice.   Incidentally, it is right across the street from Joe's Prime Steakhouse, which I yelped earlier. http://www.yelp.com/biz/…",4
2301,"Agreed. Location is great.  But there are also a lot of other hotels in the same area.  I stayed at this location for a convention being held at the venue.  If I had a choice I would have stayed elsewhere...for the following reasons: - Rooms are tiny.  They have updated the decor but doesn't make up for the closet feeling room. - Separate charge for internet service.  If some motels can provide free wifi why can't you when I pay 3x as much for a stay here? - Split elevators.  They have separate elevators for floors 1-28 and another set of elevators for the higher floors.  Confusing if it's your first day there or you switched your room several times like I did. - Broken ac/heater functions.   - Foul smell bathrooms.  Like they used a dirty cloth and no cleaning solvents to wipe down the inside of the bathrooms.  Ewwww On a positive note, the staff was wonderful and really accomodating.  If only the building and amenities reflected the cost and service - I would be a happy camper.",2
2302,"We stayed at this location for a conference for 5 days in June 07. The location was nice but I was not impress with the hotel at all. I rather stay off of Michigan Ave. if it meant we can stay at a hotel where it is cleaner and spacious. We arrived during the conference and it took awhile for us to check-in. Unfortunately, it was during high school proms, the lobby was swamped with 4 different proms the weekend and the attendees of the conference (McCormick Convention Center). I was not impress with the wait in the elevators and because it was so crowded with unsupervised teenagers and professionals, getting to the top floor was a hike. The hallway was very narrow and gloomy with unattractive 70's carpet. The room was very tight. It was two double with a 'view' but it was not much of a view. The got us excited during check in but the room/ window was against a wall so we can only see out at an angle. The bathroom was very ugly. The tub was standard and small. Very dated. The toilet was old and the seat was chipping so I can't tell if they cleaned the toilet or not. The closet door did not slide; we called someone to fix it and not one came by to fix the door during our stay. (5 days of neglect). The iron did not work so we had to call for another one. We needed to iron our clothes for work. That was also a drag. Bar was small and dingy. The desk did not know of late night restaurants. Getting a cab was about 20-30 minute wait. I was not impressed at all. The city is full of fun things to do but at the end of the day, we dreaded coming back to our room. I have to go to Chicago every year for the hubby's conference and this is one hotel I plan on never returning to. I felt like I was in a run down old Vegas casino-hotel. ****Update**** as of Summer 2008, this Marriott Downtown location went through a major renovation. Looks amazing and with a sexy bar - t.v.'s everywhere. I would stay here again if Amalfi's booked.",3
2303,"The lobby in this hotel was very nice and the food at the restaurant was excellent. The hotel staff was friendly and the breakfast room service was right on time. The hotel rooms were fairly average sized, but the decor was a little nicer than most Marriott rooms. The room has a big desk and a lot of bathroom counterspace, although the bathroom itself was on the smaller side. They only have wired internet in the room and it costs $14.95 as part of their ""wired for business"" package that includes domestic phone calls.",4
2304,"I am no hotel aficionado, but I had the opportunity to stay in this particular hotel for my first visit to the Windy City.   The location is awesome. Central to plenty of great restaurants, you are walking distance from shopping, and really anything else you may want or need. I even walked to the shore of the lake, it was beautiful. There is a full bar in the lobby, which seemed cool to me at the time, but I never got a great vibe from it. However, the bartender there was very kind and remembered me from the night before. Very tip-able staff. My room was beautiful, and very clean. Plenty of amenities. Kind of a small bathroom and nothing spectacular, but it got the job done. Downsides... No free wi-fi = stupid! The positive to this was that it forced me to learn how to connect via bluetooth through my cell phone... nerd central.   Like other posts have said the valets were a touch on the inattentive side, but they were all right.   One thing that really annoyed me was that most cabbies had no clue where this Marriott was located! There is another Marriott within walking distance so I think it is rather confusing... but really. That isn't the hotel's fault, but it is something worth mentioning. The ball room was great for the awards ceremony I attended, and again the staff was very accommodating. Worth a shot if you want to stay on the mile, and definitely a great place if you are on a business trip.",4
2305,"Excellent location obviously and the shared areas are pretty nice but the rooms are underwhelming. Did have a yummy crunchy french toast at the restaurant and the bar has an excellent selection of local brews. All in all, not bad, but far from great.",3
2306,"I went to a wedding reception here.  I will admit I did not expect much because this place seems to have been under construction for forever and I just didn't have high hopes.  It was a lovely reception, however.  The room was very modern, with a nice cool reception area outside to step away from the dance floor and cool off.  The biggest problem was that you had to ride up a very slow, cramped elevator to get there.     The soup here was...remarkable.  The best tomato-basil soup I've ever had.  Second-best wedding soup I've ever had (that would be the cream of artichoke at the Hotel Intercontinental about 12 years back).  I don't know what the magic ingredient is, but it must be pixie dust or leprechan gold shavings or unicorn kisses.  It is served with a marvelous bread top that defies description.  I just cannot say enough about it.  I would do unspeakable things to have that soup again.  I think I'm going to start calling the hotel to see what I can barter for more of this soup. Also, the wedding was beautiful and lovely.  I assume the first dance, cutting the cake, etc. was nice but couldn't look up from my soup.  I'll have to watch the video.",4
2307,"We stayed at the Marriott Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile while in Chicago on a business trip. The staff was wonderfully friendly and helpful, and the hotel is centrally located ~ step outside the doors and you're right on Chicago's Magnificent Mile. We stayed at the hotel right before the holidays and the lobby was resplendent it it's holiday finery. The tree at the center was absolutely gorgeous! Our room was tastefully done and comfortable and had all the business amenities one might need. The staff was helpful and quick to respond. I would highly recommend this hotel to others.",4
2308,"This is a review of their banquet facilities only; my graduate school alumni board, of which I am a member, recently held an awards ceremony at the Marriott and I think that it wound up being what is expected from a top-tier banquet hall, but with a few outstanding perks: *The entrance immediately gives you a feeling of being somewhere important. You walk in the door to a stair entrance down to the lounge/lobby and bar area, which is very welcoming. *The first course, a tomato bisque crostini (crostada? crostadelicious is all I have to say) was impressive- rich tomato cream soup served in ramekins covered with a pot-pie like flaky crust. Pretzel rolls and a variety of others complimented the first course really nicely and had me excited for the rest--dinner (chicken/mashed potatoes) and dessert (tiramisu) were fine but not noteworthy. Average wedding food fare. *The decor: strange jellyfish/bubbly like chandeliers that weren't so weird as to be distracting, but were still pretty enough to comment on. The room decor and lighting overall were pleasant. Also, to enter for dinner, a guy walked around with a mini-vibe set playing to get our attention to announce that it was time to sit down. Old school style.   Otherwise this was a pretty average experience. The house red wine at the bar upstairs (7th floor was where we were at) was Estancia, which I have found is becoming increasingly common. It's okay but not preferable. I'm sure that has to do with our budget as well as the Marriott's own choice. Anyhow, it's a nice venue with a few defining factors and it served our purpose quite well. I would use it again.",4
2309,Been here many times over the years for conferences.  Enjoyed the visit lives up to expectations for Marriott.,4
2310,"Yes, it's late morning and I should be working on contract issues and rifling through heaps of paper but I'm entitled to a break!  Besides, I'm basing this review on my stay at the Marriott Downtown for a couple of business meetings last week so it's completely work related.  Ugh, yeah, that's it... In any case, as other Yelpers have already noted, the Marriott Downtown costs as much as it does due to its location!  Two nights and you're looking at throwing down half of that rent check if not all of it.  Yes, the Marriott certainly is on Michigan Avenue (aka the Magnificent Mile, which isn't so magnificent when you don't have any ducketts to spend) and it's in the middle of a lot of goings-ons but the interior is quite a labyrinth of amenities.  I felt like a Hobbitt looking for a gold ring!   Upon arriving, it took me a good 20 minutes to find my room.  I asked about 4 other people and they were lost too.  Well, I found it, finally!  I have to say that I LOVED the view.  However, it was considered a Club Room upgrade and I didn't see how.  The room was rather small.  I mean, I can't complain but then again when I'm paying a couple limbs my last two nights there, I would have loved something a bit more grand than what was received. So, why did we pick this place for such a large business meeting (approximately 300 attendees!)?  It is one of the only hotels in Downtown Chicago that can accommodate parties of that size.  Oh, to top it off, let's confuse guests even more by having an escalator from the 7th floor spit you right out onto the 5th floor!?!  Wow, really?  I have to cut them some slack though because the staff was really nice and helpful.  However, along with check-in, they should give hotel guests a Tom Tom GPS navigation system to find their way around.",3
2311,"Stayed here this weekend with some friends. Cannot beat the location for Magnificent Mile shopping and dining!   Beautiful large lobby with a bar and a Starbucks.  Rooms are small (the usual for this area at an affordable price point of $145 per night) but very clean, beds plush.  Great flat screen TV.  Bathroom is TINY though, door opens and is within inches of the toilet which is awkward but again, clean with is important.  Bath and Body Works ammenities are nice too!",4
2312,"So I guess I was definitely paying for location since the website made the rooms look majestic - plush beds and gorgeous views of the Chicago skyline at night. Unfortunately, for $199 a night internet deal (back in 2003), my room I rented for 4 of my friends to celebrate my birthday was super tiny. Also, when I set up reservations, they asked an odd question where I had to put another person down for the credit card hold.  So when I checked in they requested my card and my friend's card which didn't make any sense since I was the person who was paying the whole bill. Anyway, it didn't really matter since we only needed a place to crash. Afterwards, the billing was screwed up and I noticed on my bank statement that I was double charged for the room so I had to call my bank for them to withhold the charge and speak to  a Marriot resident regarding the billing error. Marriot didn't give me much of a hassle regarding the fees but a little attention to detail would be nice.",2
2313,"This review speaks completely to the Marriott as a venue to host a meeting or event. I was here for a conference and I must say that I was impressed by some of the renovations. The colors look very modern, hip and trendy. The layout of the hotel can be a bit confusing but the hotel did a great job of placing signs to assist those who may have gotten off track. The food served for every meal, break, and the reception was great and well thought out. It didn't feel like the hotel food of ""yesteryear"" . A few negatives: the hotel didn't anticipate the need for hangers for the coat racks on a cold November day so people were tossing their coats on top of the racks while staff stood about and eventually got more hangers. Escalators were not in service and the stairwell needed to access the floor where the sessions were being held was kind of scary and dingy. Lunch serving staff seemed very unhappy, many people weren't offered drinks with their lunch or coffee. When I walked up to the hotel I was not greeted by any staff or offered any assistance though i'm sure I look baffled since I was looking for a specific entrance.",4
2314,"Yes, the location on Michigan Avenue is great, there is also a fairly busy bar scene if you feel like mingling with out-of-towners, but the decor of the place is a little crazy.   The bathroom is small and the room service food wasn't great and the worst part is that I asked for breakfast to be delivered between 7:45-8:00 and they came knocking at 6:30 (that's 3:30am in California).   Notable fact-if you need a FedEx Kinkos they have one on the second floor of the hotel, they'll also charge you a $55 service fee to deliver boxes, you've already paid to ship, to your room from their second floor facility. Wow.",2
2315,"We came here to hang out in their lobby lounge after working the Piven Theatre benefit a few weekends ago for our staff/volunteer after party. First off...the ""Very Berry"" is maybe the best thing ever. It's a deliciously dangerous drink with real pieces of fruit. I'm not even sure what's in it (some acai vodka, some other random liquor, some juice or something), but it was to die for. I believe it was $13 (not sure...I didn't pick up the tab, fortunately)...not sure I would ever justify paying that much for a drink, but if I were going to this would be the drink to do it. We ordered a variety of food, and some of it was pretty decent (the BBQ chips topped with cheese and bacon) , but others not so much (flatbread pizza...not a fan of their sauce)...probably because it wasn't an actual restaurant (that I'm aware of), but mainly just a bar. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed, with some curtains between the long sofas for privacy between parties. We had like 20+ people with us, so that wasn't an issue. It was a pretty nice place to have an afterparty after a crazy busy day/night of fundraising for the arts. My feet were killing me and I would have been happy anywhere I could sit down, but I'm glad they chose the Marriott to host us. Aside from the lobby lounge area, I haven't seen any other parts of the hotel, so I can't comment on that, unfortunately.",4
2316,Airline boarding pass kiosk in lobby. Express checkout is through speed dial and TV menu. If you call for late check out there's a fee.  No wifi in room.  The front desk can cash checks or change currency.   There's a business center and baggage storage.  If you smoke in the room they charge $250.  Same day dry cleaning if you submit it before 9:00 am.  They will refer a babysitter if given a day's notice.  Wired-for-business Internet is $14.95 per day.   24 hour Fitness Center on the 9th floor   Concierge can send mail through DHL and UPS.  Ice machine on every floor. They'll leave you a voicemail at the room if you receive a package.  You can hear the club lounge from the elevator.,4
2317,"Really conveniently located hotel with lovely rooms.  I was here one night earlier this week, and the beds were the most comfortable hotel beds I have been in in months.   I also liked that they had a busy bar scene on Tues night around 11pm- looked like a lot of biz folks were at the hotel and that was nice, since it's also tourist season and it sucks to travel for business and stay at a hotel filled with families.  Makes you miss home even more :) Also, room was large and the hotel was right on the Magnificent Mile, close to tons of good restaurants and SHOPPING!",4
2318,"I stayed here  w/  a friend during the labor day holiday. It's definitely the best location for a hotel if you want to be right in the middle of downtown Chicago. There were about 2 conferences going on in the hotel during my stay. So of course you will be taking the local elevator during the peak hours of the conference due to people going back and forth. It wasn't as bad as one would think. The hotel staff was definitely friendly during check-in, walking around the hotel, and check-out. they cleaned the room everyday immaculately, to the point I thought I walked into a new room. The room was GREAT! The view from the 35 floor ROCKED (although a bit scary b/c the window goes from floor to ceiling)! The only drawback is that $33 a day parking...def a hott mess! We stayed 6 days so that's $198...so not what anyone wants to pay on top of staying at over $100.00.",4
2319,"Really nice hotel.  As a Marriott employee I stayed here a few weeks ago on my sweet holiday discount, and I have to say I was impressed. Really small rooms...but what can one expect in an older building in downtown Chicago...",5
2320,"I was here for an Industry Conference (11/6-7/2008) but I didn't stay here since I'm ""local"".  However I will comment on the lunches we were served and the liquor. First day's lunch was actually an amazing piece of work, however, since it was the ONLY lunch option for the day and I don't like eggplant, well, I was really hungry after lunch. After a normal salad, we were served up truly a beautiful dish of Eggplant Parmesan.  3 Medium thick slices of eggplant were breaded and fried and then stacked with a ricotta/onion mix layered in between.  Melted shredded parmesan was on top and a spicy marinara was draped on and around the dish.  Truly magnificent if that's what you like.  Dessert was a slice of Eli's Chocolate Chip Cheesecake. Second day's lunch was much better.  We started off with a cream corn chowder soup (it was a chilly day too) and then it was a Cobb Salad with really fresh ham and turkey sliced on it.  Dessert was this awesome lemon meringue tart that was to die for. Both our private open bar and the bar in the lobby of the hotel served up a wide variety of bottled beers and extensive wines.  There pretty much wasn't anything you couldn't handle. Also, free wi-fi everywhere in the hotel is always a plus, especially when you're a guest for a conference and you're not checked in.  Valet was slow as heck, but I parked in the lot just to the northwest of the hotel for much cheaper.",3
2321,"I've stayed here twice, once for work and once on vacation.  Overall it's a nice hotel with a great location and I would stay on future trips to Chicago.  Here are the highlights: The Good: Lobby Bar There was a surprising amount of amusing antics in the lobby bar.  It was great to sit back and watch people drop game, especially those that shouldn't be.  It was packed Friday and Saturday night. Starbucks There was a line in the morning, but you can't beat the convenience of having one in the lobby (or one right across the street, or one two doors down.....) Location Walk out the back door, walk down Michigan Avenue...... Staff Nothing but great things to say about the staff.  Everyone that we encountered was just fantastic The Bad: Elevators If you were on floors 29 on up (which we were) there was always a significant wait for the elevators.  There was a bank of eight elevators servicing these floors, but only two were running.  Someone told me that the staff claimed this was temporary, but I had the same issue on both visits, which were eight months apart. Street Noise Maybe I'm just a country bumpkin, but there sure was a lot of street noise coming up to the 37th floor.  It may have just been our particular room, bu it seemed like the seals on our window weren't tight and a lot of outside noise was getting in. Overall it had been a good place to stay and I envision staying there again when I go back in September.",3
2322,"This place was ranking high on my favorite full-service Marriott's until the last evening....get this, they don't turn the heat on until it's in the 40s outside.  Chicago, rainy, cold, windy, whatever...and 53 degrees at 5PM and I get told they won't be turning the heat on for the evening, and that they suggest to turn off all ""heat"" buttons on our in room fan because that will just blow cold air.  Would you ever think to ask if a hotel had heat?? I wouldn't, and have certainly stayed in some less than desirable places.   Yes, this is a good location, and yes the free bar/lobby/2nd floor wi-fi is great, and the bar area is fantastic (lined with granite and marble, also chilly when the temperature drops) but when it's cold, nothing else matters. Comment from the manager- ""Call me and I'll bring you some hot tea and blankets when you're ready to go sleep.  A discount on the room won't make it any warmer."" Apparently, the heat was eventually turned on, but this is an old location, so we never noticed the difference.  Seems as though Chicago buildings need a minor revamp (and I bet they had heat at the Ritz).",2
2323,"Love the fact that the Marriott sits right in the middle of downtown Magnificent Mile where everything is walkable - shopping/restaurants, Wendella Boat Rides, Chicago Tribune, Chicago River Walk, etc. Convenience always helps when you are on trips!! If you don't mind staying in a small room (not your standard Marriott spacious hotel room but managed to get by with 4 people), then go for it! There is a bar and open lounge area right when you walk in and a Starbucks inside right next to the concierge.",3
2324,"The Marriott is located right in the center of the Miracle Mile..... Great location!!!!!   Rooms are comfortable, but not trendy or fancy. Stay here for the awesomw location........and some decent views of the Chicago skyline.",4
2325,The location of the hotel is the major selling point for this hotel (which gets a plus one star) Located right on Michigan Ave which has a lot of restaurants and shopping. It also is several blocks away from the Chicago Art Institute (I walk fast so if you walk slow or don't like walking take a cab). The staff is very friendly and courteous. The views from your room on the top floors are pretty cool (request that if you are staying). The lobby has a bar right there which serve excellent strawberry mojito ($15). They have a lot of elevators but can still be an issue during peak times (7:30 AM and 5:30 PM) with it running slow or filled with people. The rooms are not as large as most standard Marriotts but that is usually expected for hotels within a city. They had water issues where they didn't have very hot water or if you are taking a shower the water would get cold then when you turn it up suddenly it's gets scalding. Despite some annoyances it's a nice stay.,4
2326,Wonderful service and perfect location! I loved how everything was walking distance! :),4
2327,"I would like to first say that I am a huge Marriott fan.  I've stayed at lots of Marriotts all over the country, and have rarely been dissapointed.  I was this time.  Our room smelled like a nasty old cigarette, even though supposedly it was a non-smoking room.  The bathroom was so small you could barely close it to go to the bathroom.  There were a couple of hairs in the shower, before we ever used it so they weren't ours!!!   The only real saving grace to this hotel is that the location is pretty much perfect.  And there's a Starbucks in the lobby which is nice. Wouldn't stay here again.",2
2328,"Small rooms and bathroom. Outstanding customer service, we got in late, about 11pm on a Thursday, im gluten intolerant so i packed food knowing i would not be able to find anything to eat at that time of night. My food required warming up in a microwave. The room had a mini-fridge but no microwave, my husband called to the front desk staff to see if there was a microwave somewhere which we could use. They said there was not one in the hotel, when my husband explained the situation, they said they would see what they could do. Shortly after making the phone call, a staff member showed up to our door carrying a microwave which he left in our room for us. I've never experienced such a thing and felt so grateful!",4
2329,"Not Marriott quality.  Poor management, poor customer service, no follow through on customer service.  Specifically: -internet sucks -manager doesn't follow through on action items -management makes no effort to compensate clientele for inconveniences -management makes no effort to address discrepancies in bills until I pointed it out right at check-out Soooooo, if you're thinking of typical Marriott quality, don't think of this place.",1
2330,"This review is for the public areas and meeting facilities only.   I just finished a two day class at this hotel which was held in its meeting/conference facility.   I loved it.  The entire hotel layout is beautiful.  It's bright, a bit busy and modernly decorated.  All of the staff who I had interactions with, from concierge to the cleaners I passed in the hallway, were friendly and attentive.  Although we were only provided coffee, tea and pastries in the morning and soda in the afternoon the spread was still exceptional.  Everything was fresh and tasty, the coffee and hot water were refilled and kept hot.  I passed another meeting room that had amazing a spread for lunch and then a spread that included cheese, ice cream or fruit for their afternoon snack (I was jealous but refrained from stealing their food).  There is also a Starbucks in the hotel that makes quality drinks (unlike many hotel versions) so there is no need to hit the Starbucks across the street (like I did on my first day) before you arrive.   Another plus is it is in a very central location for shopping and eating downtown.  I was very tempted to shop at Nordstrom during my lunch break.",4
2331,"It's a great budget option if you're really looking for proximity to the Loop and Mag mile. We spent a night here just to get away, and overall I was pleased. The hotel is bustling, the service is attentive and efficient, and the space is very clean despite heavy traffic. The room is very small, and we paid extra for a 'large room', but that doesn't bother me for a short stay with 2 adults. However, the room really lacked basic amenities: no mini fridge, blow dryer, silverware or glassware. Just would have been nice to know ahead of time, so I could have planned a little better. Nice space, and I would stay here again. I can't imagine having kids in the room, though - just too small for a family space!",4
2332,"Definitely not my favorite hotel to stay if I expect to find peace and quiet.  The lobby area and outside the rooms is very busy all the time and therefore, quite noisy.  The location is convenient though.",3
2333,"My fiance says I shouldn't make Mormon jokes while we're checking in at the Marriott.  Maybe that is why Mom's room had all kinds of stuff in the bathroom (q-tips, cotton balls, shower cap, etc.) that we didn't have and she had chocolates on her bed!!!  Damn them giving me the special Atheist room!   There are some fine features about this hotel: 1) It couldn't be in a better location.  We walked all over this lovely city and could easily catch a cab at a moment's notice if needed. 2) The elevators in this joint are CRAZY fast.  I don't know if they are run by space rockets or what, but if you can catch one that doesn't stop on every floor to pick up other people, you won't believe how fast they move.  3)  The hotel has been recently renovated and the room was very clean and fresh feeling.  4)  The staff members were all very nice and the operation was insanely efficient considering how big and wildly busy the place was. Not so lovely things about it would include the following: 1) Feather pillows - hate them.  It would be great if there were are alternatives so that you don't feel like you are resting on a pile of birds.  2)  The hallways are seriously over air conditioned.  They could settle down with the A/C and save some of that money to send to the church.  What are they thinking?!  3) Bad hairdryers - Low is not warm and high is insanely blowing your hair all over the place.  Mom agreed on this one.  4)  The windows seemed like they were not double paned or not thick enough.  Our room faced Michigan Ave. and even though we were on the 32nd floor, it was so loud with sirens and cars honking.  We were there for the July 4th weekend, which was probably an especially loud time.  It just seemed like there could be better windows to make it less noisy inside.  I need some peace and quiet to curl up with my Book of Mormon and read more about the angel Moroni.",4
2334,"I stayed here for a convention over Memorial Day weekend. Like other reviewers mentioned, the location really cannot be beat. It's right in the middle of everything, and it was an excellent location to explore the city from. From my experience, the staff is incredibly helpful and kind. Downsides are definitely the lack of mini fridges (!) and the size of the rooms, which were a definite squeeze for me and the 3 other people I stayed with. There was almost no space for our luggage, which was a problem. What irked me most though was probably the paid internet. This place isn't cheap; if a Motel 8 has free wi-fi, why doesn't this hotel? Overall a good experience though. Would recommend.",4
2335,My girlfriend got us a room here last night and she requested a high level room and was granted just that on the very top floor not only was successful but to top Melissa (front desk) sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne. It was a great start to am amazing night. I highly recommend this hotel. Thanks!,5
2336,"I arrived a bit early for a dinner meeting one Sunday, so I stopped at the Chicago Marriott Downtown Hotel to review my notes and sip on some Cosmopolitans.  I'll tell ya.... the bartender really knew how to mix a Cosmo!!  I had 2 cocktails and they served glasses of nuts with the drinks.  I was alone but I had a nice time.  Really could have stayed there all evening.... but my time was limited.  Hey, I highly recommend the bar area in the lobby of the Marriott.",4
2337,You are definitely paying for location here. I would say that this is a pretty standard hotel that happens to be in the middle of Michigan. I wasn't taken back by the lobby although the lounge was neat when we stayed. It's under renovation now. The rooms aren't over the top and the desk service is hit and miss. I would stay at the Hyatt.,3
2338,"The Marriott is OK but pales in comparison to the numerous hotels in the area that are frankly better. The lobby fills up with people, probably because the rooms are so average in size and quality. The revolving door along Michigan Avenue is automatic, but turns slowly so there is always the desire to push it along (not a good idea). The location of the hotel along Michigan Avenue is good, and the Kinko's on the second floor is not as busy as other locations in the city.",3
2339,"I stayed at the Marriott this weekend because I had friends in town and I wanted to stay downtown.  The hotel was pretty nice but the rooms are tiny (although gorgeous view).  The bathroom was barely big enough to turn around in.  I was a little disappointed with the room itself, but the service was really good - extra towels in less than 10 minutes, the concierge was nice and fast and the front desk staff was helpful.  If you're looking for a hotel downtown this one is definitely worth a try - I would stay here again, but I would think twice before stuffing 4 people in a room.",4
2340,"Gorgeous property.  Magnificent lobby.  Great rooms.  Free breakfast downstairs at the restaurant for higher status members.  Great concierge food.  Right next to the mall.  Walking distance to everything.  Only annoyance I've found is that bath tubs are slow drains, meaning 30 sec after turning on the water your feet will be under water.",4
2341,"I attended a special event here and have to say that it was pretty nice. The lobby entrance was a little chaotic and not clean because of construction, but the conceirge staff directed me where to go for my event.  The banquet and event floor is really nice and airy. The dark red and yellow carpet complements the rich wood lining the walls. The event that I attended took up all most of the ballroom.. The ballroom matches the hallway as well. In general, the facilities were nice. The lunch that they served us was pretty good I have to say. For being hotel conference food, it was good. They served chicken parm, ceasar salad, and steamed veggies. It was a tasty, light meal that was decent. For the cocktail reception, my first cocktail was pretty strong, but the second one was a little sweeter. Out of all of the food they served, the chocolate brownie was killer. It was a good mix of sweet and rich. Best hotel chocolate brownie that I've had. In general, the hotel banquet facilties were nice and clean. The food was pretty good too.",4
2342,Perfect location for shoppers but not the greatest hotel in terms of quality of rooms.  The lobby was amazing and so was the staff.  The rooms on the other hand were just dull other than the views out over the city.  We turned the couch around and had a bottle of wine looking out over the city at night 33 floors up and it was perfect!  Overall best location for a hotel for shoppers but your paying for just the location not the quality of rooms.,4
2343,"Clean, great area if you want to tour the city because you are right on Michigan Ave, fair price (I got my deal on http://Hotwire.com for $110!) and awesome service! Beautiful lobby. Are flexible. Stayed for 4th of July so it was really busy but they took good care of us!",4
2344,"Wonderfully located to all of the Magnificent Mile shopping and dining, as well as the Rush ST entertainment district.  Easy access to Lake Shore DR or I-94 and the Loop as well.  The valet and bellhops work hard to get you in and out of your car which can be tricky since they only have one lane in their pull-in area.  Yeah, the $48 valet parking is pretty steep, and there are lots of garages nearby, but come on, this is downtown Chicago parking is a bigger bear than those guys playing down at Soldier Field, you may end up spending less with the valet if you want in and out privileges.  The lobby is gorgeous.  Contemporary without feeling cold.  Elevators (at least the high rise ones) are fast and efficient.  Every staff person I came in contact with was courteous and professional.  The rooms aren't huge, but large enough.  Comfy beds.  Shower had great water pressure (pet peeve of mine).   Here's a tip...if you want a great view high up request a feather free bedding room.  We were on the 39th floor on the Michigan AVE side which gave us gorgeous views of the Mag Mile skyline.",4
2345,"An upscale hotel with nice rooms, very comfortable beds, good concierge, and the best location possible.  The Michigan Ave. location is as good as it gets, and it was nice to be able to step out in the middle of the shopping district.  I'll definitely stay here in the future.",4
2346,"The service is wonderful here - the room looks like it could be 'freshened up', but they are renovating right now, so maybe that's next.  The view is amazing - I'm looking out at the lake right now.  Not only are they quick with service, they also followed up to be sure that the housekeeper I had requested came. However, room service menu both very pricey and pretty lame.  Far too many good places to eat nearby - no need to waste your time/money inside.",4
2347,"I recently stayed here while attending a local convention.  The room was okay, but I did not like the fact that they charged $14 a day for internet service.  Perhaps this is common in Chicago hotels, but it seems like it should be included in the room cost.  So if you are a business traveler, keep this in mind.  Also, I found the bathroom and room a little small, although comfortable.  Overall the lobby was great, and the staff were friendly and helpful.  You certainly will enjoy a beautiful view of the City of Chicago from your window.",3
2348,"This is the first time my family has stayed at this facility. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. However, even though we booked the room weeks in advance, my wife and I were given a handicapped accessible room even though neither if us is handicapped. I commend Marriott for having these rooms available for those who require such accommodations however the room was very ""user unfriendly"" for both my wife and I.  The coat hooks on the back of the bathroom door made our clothes drag on the floor, the shower had no shower curtain which allowed water to splash all over the bathroom floor during my shower (my wife refused to use the shower).  The pillows on the bed were not the traditional rectangle pillows as they were square and not nearly big enough. Also, given the price we paid for the room we were amazed that Internet access was $14.95 and not included in the room price. Given the above I would not recommend this hotel and we will not be booking a reservation at this Marriott location in the future.",1
2349,"There are a few things I like about this hotel, and a few things I absolutely hate. The lobby is a nice open area. + The employees are helpful and nice, even house keeping was nice! + The hotel is easy to get lost in. - We requested king size beds, we got twins. - WiFi is not free, despite it being 2010. - (It's 14.95 for ""fast 256k service for 24 hours"") The rooms don't have microwaves or refrigerators, seriously? - The room is small, it compares to a $40 room. There's some obnoxious banging that happens outside the door every 10 minutes or so, and I can hear a buzzing noise coming from the room below. makes it pretty hard to sleep. The food that the hotel restaurant serves is strange/unappetizing. -",1
2350,"Marriott is my favorite regular hotel for business trips, and I stayed here often before relocating to Chicago.  The best feature of this Marriott is its location, in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and so close to great restaurants and shopping.  The free Navy Pier shuttle is across the street on Grand and Rush, and the Westfield Mall anchored by Nordstrom is a stone's throw away.  I will say the concierge lounge in this location (2nd floor) offers so-so food compared to most other Marriotts.  I love the exercise and weight room behind the pool area (treadmills are in a separate room right beside the elevator bank); equipment is state of the art and I have never found it crowded.  The quality of the rooms is on par with most Marriotts; this location is a little older and shows its age in that regard, but furniture and cleanliness are good.  Wifi is free in the lobby but not in the rooms (unless you're a gold or platinum member).",4
2351,The absolute best location in Chicago. close to everything and nice rooms. Had to take a star away since it's not wireless internet yet. overall a great location though,4
2352,My husband and I stopped here for breakfast while walking around on Michigan Ave one morning.  It was so delish!  We both had the breakfast buffet.  The pancakes were superb as were the breakfast potatoes.,5
2353,"My family has been staying at Marriott's since my dad started his career. We used points to stay here, and wow has it gone down hill...they need to stop building those stupid Springhill Suites all over parts of Bumblef*ck Indiana and Kentucky, and go back and invest in some of their most significant properties.",1
2354,"We looked at this hotel for our wedding.  We could not get a date that worked otherwise we would have held it here.  We worked with Amy and she was great.  Very responsive and worked with us on price.  The hotel is in a great location, has a decent sized pool, big bar, rooftop deck, and the price for parking was a bit better than the other hotels we looked at.",4
2355,I've stayed here a couple times and had good experiences. That said I've only stayed on the HHonors floor which is almost like a mini hotel inside the big hotel. It even has a separate check in area on the floor itself so you don't have to deal with the main check in area. The only thing I don't like about the HHonors floor is that the free breakfast is continental only while you usually get a free hot breakfast at most Hiltons with the HHonors floors. The hotel itself is in a great location and has all the usual amenities you would expect. The rooms themselves are average sized but look to have been very recently updated. The views from the lakeside ones are great although I don't think they are worth the extra money they charge.,4
2356,"We used Priceline to get a deal here - this was the most expensive hotel on my vacation, and it wasn't worth the extra cost, but everything costs more in Chicago anyway.  Internet charges, bag hold charges, insane parking charges... these things are pretty standard for an expensive hotel (I'm paying more, so give me less! Logic!)  Cheaper parking is available at surrounding garages for about $25 overnight. We did however LOVE that our two-bed room had two bathrooms.  Greatest thing ever.  We also got a decent view of the Sears Tower.  If you get a good deal here, go for it.",3
2357,"*Extremely disappointed* I booked the Hilton solely because of the University of Chicago shuttle deal, where you can stay and get a free shuttle to and from the university. I knew I would be going to Hyde Park quite a few times and the shuttle was worth it. When I arrive, they tell me that because I checked off the AAA rate, they can't give me the U of C deal, which they did not state on their website. So, I tell the agent I will pay the difference in rate. Nope. It's an ""online only"" deal. Fine, then I want to cancel and rebook online. Nope. The front desk agent Morgan was extremely rude and rolled her eyes while talking to me. If you hate your job, get a new one! ---- The room itself was fine. Clean, soft towels, king sized bed, flat screen, good bath products... Also did not like the $2 per item coat check. But I did like the coffee shop in the lobby and the general liveliness.",1
2358,"The staff here is awesome. Honestly, so nice and good at their jobs. I cannot sing enough praises for this group of people who graciously handled 4000 Harry Potter fans running a muck for 4 days. The rooms are nice and really clean and the location is awesome, right across from Grant and Millenium Park and just a couple of blocks from the lake.",5
2359,"Stayed there this weekend and was impressed with the service, everyone seemed to want to make my experience memorable.",4
2360,"I'd recommend asking for a room on floors 9 and above.  These are the newly renovated rooms which are very modern.  They also have rooms with two bathrooms so you could request these if you are sharing and prefer your own bathroom.  The hotel is across the street from Millenium Park, a few blocks from the Magnificent Mile and close to tons of restaurants and bars.",4
2361,This place is mega gigantor. It's like a city within chicago. Some towns dont hold this many people. For the price performance value it's hard to beat for a large city. $125/night with weekend stay is pretty solid. The location is another plus. Being near the lake on Michigan ave within walking distance to a ton of things and near public transit. Im sure that's why they are popular with the conference crowd. For me a decent bed and clean bathroom is the gist of what I need and this hotel delivered that. There's tons of shops and eating joints within the hotel too so if you really want to just hole up and not go anywhere that's also a choice. No free internet is a bummer though.,4
2362,"For 280 a night Internet should come with the room, not separately.  Also, a fridge didn't come standard although I was able to get one when I asked. Usually I would give props for a clean room, but the blood stained towels the first day kind of ruined that. The last straw for me was trying to change my checkout day.  They wanted to charge me for a night even though the hotel is full capacity and they won't lose money from my not being here.  They did come down by half, but I still feel ripped off.",2
2363,"I appreciate that this was the cheapest standard hotel option (i.e., no hostels, b&b's, inns, etc.)  to be found in town at $143 a night, and I absolutely appreciated that our 2 double-bed room had TWO bathrooms, but I found so many cheap annoyances.   First, why couldn't we have proper queen beds, which has become the standard in most American hotels?  These were definitely doubles, and can be a bit cramped for two.  Also, how much is in-room internet?? The room includes a computer with some pre-loaded tourist information, but why not offer up internet if you have it installed? Finally - greatest pet peeve -- $2 to check a bag with the concierge?? That is incredibly unjust and makes this ""Hilton"" feel so cheap! Other than those complaints, I had a good night's sleep right across the street from the Art Institute.",3
2364,"This was my husband and I first visit to Chicago and we really did not know what to expect, but we had a blast and relaxing stay.  The Hilton Chicago is a gourgeous and elegant hotel.  Our room was huge, clean, comfortable, and with a breath taking view.  We had four windows in our room with a view of Lake Michigan from each.  We also had a view of Grand Park, Soldier Stadium, and the museum.  Not only was the hotel a beautiful experience, the staff was amazing.  Everyone we encountered was friendly, accomodating, and professional.  Although all the staff was great, there were two staff that was outstanding and went over and beyond to make sure our stay at the Hilton Chicago was the best.  The first person we encountered when we arrived was Alicia, guest service agent.  She is the sweetest person with a welcoming smile.  We were so tired after our early morning travel, but Alicia put a smile on our faces that lasted throughout the trip.  Words can not describe her beautiful and warm personality.  Thank you Alicia.  The second person we encountered was Antonio.  Antonio is an energic young man who is full of life.  He assisted us with our bags and you can tell that this young man takes great pride in his job.  That was refreshing to see.  I would highly recommend this hotel, because it is truly a 5 star.  I have read the other reviews and it is unfortunate that some did not share my experience, because in my opinion a bad experience is not the norm for this beautiful hotel and the warm, beautiful staff.",5
2365,"US Presidents have stayed in this hotel. This is a good place to stay if you're more interested in going to Grant Park and the Museum Plaza. We chose this hotel because of its location to be close to the museum but far enough from the hustle and bustle of shops in the Magmile. This hotel is part of a history and the decor was dated but I think that's what makes it a little bit charming that its not all linear and too modern on the public areas. I loved the view of the Lake. One thing, they need more concierge on their staffing. They had one concierge on a Friday evening and I thought it was just annoying that we had to wait for over 15 minutes just to get a small map of downtown. Our stay here was great and we always had service in our room so there wasn't much to complain since we were out most of the time.",4
2366,Terrible experience. The hotel was on strike which made it even worse. Would not stay here again.,2
2367,"I would have given it four stars, but the nickel and diming just got to me. There is no reason to charge 25 bucks a night extra plus tax for an executive room and wifi and fitness equipment access when I can get free wifi at a holiday inn and use fitness equipment too.  This was just a ripoff. Don't park at the hotel.  There are several self pay places right behind the hotel.  You can pay 45 bucks a day at the hotel, or you can pay 22 bucks a day.  You choose.  And it's a short block. I prepaid for the hotel via hotwire, but they still asked for a card for incidentals and put a $300 hold on it.  They could have at least told me what they were doing when they were doing it.  I found out in checking my balances online. The room was nice, but some things unnecessary.  My room had a huge flat screen, two double beds, and two full bathrooms.  We didn't really need two full bathrooms, though it's a unique touch. Newly renovated rooms.  The metro train runs and is audible from the room.  This might really bother some people, but it didn't bother me or my son.  We sleep like rocks, and there's something about the sound of trains that I actually find kind of soothing.  We are also night owls anyway, and the train stops running after like 2 or 3, so it didn't impede our sleep. The inside of the hotel is great.  The place is is like a titanic ocean liner without the sinking.  This is a grand dame hotel with a lot of history, celebrating its 85th year this year.  I't's decorated very nicely.  Presidents and celebrities have stayed here.  The penthouse suites are something like 2700 square feet.  It's a splurge place.   I got a lower price on hotwire.  I think because it's so big (1544 rooms), they always have some rooms available and so need to go that route.  I almost booked it on http://hotels.com, was thrilled to get it for much cheaper on hotwire, though the wifi/fitness equipment charge took away some of the discount (http://hotels.com had various packages that included different things such as parking or wifi, many different head spinning combinations to confound).  Anyway, I think I still got a bargain. I'd recommend it to any first timer to Chicago, so they can have a grand experience. For subsequent visits to Chi-town, stay at a place that offers free wifi and free or more reasonable parking.  But we really enjoy the grandness of it, and were happy to be there.",3
2368,"Got our room here from HotWire as one of those ""surprise"" choices where you don't know what you're getting - and it paid off. Stayed here for our first visit to Chicago. Room was great (16th floor). Staff was friendly. The level of decadence doesn't quite equal something like the Paris hotel in Vegas, but it was solidly elegant and comfortable. Great location for what we wanted to do (to tour the loop and museums basically). Easy train access about two blocks away. We walked most places. Major plus being right across the street from Millenium Park. The only negative I can think of was parking. The night we got there the self-parking lot filled up so we had to valet park (which was expensive imo, $57/night). I know parking is just plain expensive in the loop, but $57 seemed extreme to me. The skinny? I'd stay here again provided I got a good rate again.",4
2369,"Alright, friends.  I'm going to be as straightforward as possible.  This place is a dump.  It's just gross.  I'm tempted to leave it at this, but I feel obligated to let you know why this place is an avoid-at-all-costs establishment. The premise of my stay at the Hilton was a work trip for BF about a week ago.  His firm paid for his room, and I got to tag along (yay trip to Chi!).  I usually stay at Embassy Suites (another Hilton chain, ironically), but since one cannot argue with a free hotel stay, one goes where one is told. As I mentioned, this was a business trip, and the convention was held in the hotel, so it was packed. We walked in and pushed through the barrage of company polo shirt clad attorneys, and wives that stepped right out of a Talbots catalog, to the reservation desk.  I noticed a few people taking photos of their kids in the lobby, which is sort of a grand foyer kind of deal.  I presume most people think that this is a gorgeous area; I'll just say it's not my taste.  Were it 1984, and I was Janet Jackson on tour, I probably would have been a little more impressed.   We make our way to the reservation desk, which appears to be reminiscent of a Cedar Point queue line.  After our long and strenuous quest, we make it to the desk, where we are asked for BF's credit card, for the purpose of ""holding the room,"" and the card was not to be charged. Keep this tidbit in your mind, folks.  Since the room was supposedly prepaid for, we were a little confused, but obliged, so as not to hold up the line any longer. (Insert ""That 70s Show"" transition with BF and I dancing in acid washed jeans and over-sized shirts) We return to check into our room. Whoa! Throwback. This place had obviously not been updated since the 80s. Not to mention the fact that I don't think the AC had been serviced since the 80s, since we walked into a brick wall of heat immediately after stepping off the elevator. Once we actually get into our room, I acknowledge the small amount of nostalgic charm, and since I had just rode back from Wrigleyville on the El, after many beers, I head to the bathroom. It's fair to mention I'm quite a germophobe.  I spray everything with my TSA approved bottle of Lysol, and whip out Clorox wipes.  This place was enough to make BF (the complete opposite of me) cringe. First off neither the drain in the sink, nor the tub, worked.  The toilet was a push-lever model, straight from the industrial building store. Nothing appeared to be cleaned well, as I noticed water marks everywhere. The towels were dingy and some had dirty spots.  Shudder. Like the drains, the AC didn't work either.  I had called maintenance, who was supposed to send someone up ""right away,"" however they were a no show.  Perhaps they were attending the soiree that the housekeepers were having in the linen room down the hall.  Everyone was having a grand time... laughing, being merry, being obnoxiously loud. It reminded me of the sort of party Gatsby could pull off.   Day 2, and our maid, who, I think may have both been deaf and not an English speaker (honestly, not trying to be mean here), came to clean.  Except the fact that I was in the room. Sleeping. One would expect the housekeeper to leave a sleeping guest lie. Not so. She carried on with banging things around in the bathroom, and then discovered the drain. She apparently couldn't clean the bathroom with the malfunctioning drain, so she decided to tell us we needed to call maintenance right then. BF was trying to explain that we were napping and would call later, but she was insistent to the point that she came into the living area of our room, picked up the phone, and tried showing us what she wanted by dialing a bunch of numbers and then slamming the phone down. We politely tried to shoo her out, and she finally got the hint that we were trying to rest. Day 3, maintenance finally comes, and explains to me that the AC is not broken, but rather there is a secret trick to making it work!  Alas, my troubles are solved!  How stupid of me, I should have known that you have to press two buttons down, while turning the thermostat down, waiting for the screen to say something, and then releasing the buttons. Very user friendly.  He also fixes the drain at this point, but makes a huge mess. I called to have them clean it up, but again, nobody came. Checking out was the highlight of the trip. Until we realized that BFs card was charged for the room. They proceeded to ""fix"" the problem by transferring the charges to his boss's card, until two days later, and a charge is showing as an overdraft. They had not fixed anything, and we find out that not only did they charge BF's personal card, they charged the firm card, and the partner's personal card. That's quite an amount, mind you. After many phone calls and excess time spent, everything was adjusted finally. Needless to say we will not be staying here again.",1
2370,"We stayed here one night using a deal we got on Expedia. A parking package was included which really came in handy. the hotel was absolutely lovely. It has such a classy vintage feel throughout the whole building. In the lobby there's a really cute cafe that serves Starbucks. We stayed on the 8th floor which conveniently was on the same floor as the pool. Unfortunately the pool and hot tubs were run a muck with children, but the deck outside of the pool is absolutely amazing. the view is breath taking. We originally ordered a room that was a single full-sized bed. THe man at the check in counter upgraded us to a room with 2 beds no charge because he said it was a larger room. The room was very clean and so was the bathroom. No complaints. The location of the hotel is totally perfect. A 10 minute walk to millenium park and the museums. Grant park is right across the street.",5
2371,"We stayed here a few nights for a graduation in Chicago. It was a great location and quite nice being so close to all of the Chicago attractions. The room was clean and quiet, and the check-in process was quick. My only gripe is that it is an older hotel and you just get that old vibe from the place. But if that doesn't bother you, it's a great place to stay.",4
2372,"Talk about Historic.   Just taking the elevator to my room, the tv screen is spitting out all these facts about the hotel....   Quite impressive.   I walk into my room (which has a double bed), and its the size of a small apartment.   The receptionist told me that some of the double bed rooms are twice the size of king sized beds - and although I like King beds....   This was nice.     The new renovations have added some new technology to the room - and this computer which is all ""High Tech""... is annoying as hell.   First off - the internet is NOT free.   They don't tell you the price, but a small warning comes up saying very sneakily that you agree that all charges can be placed on your room....     You can clearly tell that this software is just another ad revenue for the hotel since most of the ""recommended"" places to visit also happen to advertise on it.... Hmmmmm  interesting.   The parking situation is stupid expensive!!  I understand you are in Chicago, and it's a freaking commodity, but $50 per night!!!    I was there for a week!!!!   Great room, nice views, friendly staff..... TOO expensive!",4
2373,"I will admit it, the Hilton in downtown Chicago is not my usual go-to for accommodations in the city. It's the place that, when on vacation there I would always see it and sigh and think, when I have enough money I would love to stay there. So, this past weekend, while in town for a wedding, my fiancé and I decided to treat ourselves and get a room here. Now, let me say up front, that the entrance lobby is very impressive. And the suites that the bridal party were in were absolutely gorgeous. Even our floor and room were rather tasteful, if you like modern-chic. Also, it is very clean, as one should expect of place with such a high reputation. Hence why I gave it two stars instead of one. Now, the bad. First of all, a lot of these have to do with price. I am stating this up front because yes, we did understand that we would be paying quite a bit. Hence the whole ""we decided to treat ourselves"" bit. What I didn't know, and wish I had, was that despite the fact that you pay twice, even three times the amount on a room here compared to most places, our money only went about half, even a third as far as it does at those other places. 1) There is no included wifi. You must pay for it, and there is no wired connection option. Considering the cost of wifi or a wired connection, this seemed extremely tacky and cheap 2) No breakfast. Of any kind. You either pay the overly extravagant prices of the restaurant connected to the lobby, which is mostly a bar and dinner place to begin with, or have a coffee and breakfast at Starbucks. Not very classy for a place like the Hilton. 3) The room, despite being exorbitantly expensive, was incredibly small. We were so cramped, we had to pack our stuff away in the silly wardrobe/closet they give you, or risk several stubbed toes or possible broken bones from tripping over our weekend suitcases. (Note, these were small enough to be airplane carry-ons). 4) This size issue was also an issue in the bathroom, the shower of which was so small that if you dropped something, you would have to open the door to bend down and pick it up. 5) Yes, it was clean. In a there's-no-mold-or-bugs way, but the ceiling was dusty and full of cobwebs. 6) View. Even though this hotel is in the center of Chicago, right across Michigan Ave from the park, we got to look at a brick wall...and our neighbors. 7) Without telling us, up front, at the desk or otherwise, they overcharged our credit card to cover a per night deposit. I don't have a problem with this in principle, but it's a good thing we weren't close to our limit because not knowing that that would go on there, even temporarily, could have caused some major problems. 8) No help with parking. I know that most hotels charge for parking, especially in downtown Chicago, but several I have stayed at give a discount or some sort of thing for their guests. Or at least a price that is competitive. However, this didn't end up being a huge problem, since we just saved $20 a day by parking in the Millennium garage instead. Good thing we did too, because apparently the extra cost of parking at the Hilton didn't make your car any safer as one of our family member's had her car broken into while parked there. Basically, the hotel was rather nice. But expensive. And I don't mean in a ""you have to pay to get nice things way."" We actually got much less for our money all around than we do at our usual vacation spot (the Embassy Suites). Basically, you stay here if you have so much money you enjoy spending it unnecessarily. Your money buys you the location, and the prestige of telling cab drivers ""The Hilton, please.""",2
2374,"Gorgeous public spaces! The history of the building was fascinating. My room was on a recently renovated floor, and everything looked brand new - except the bathroom door which apparently hadn't been repainted since the '80s. It's a pet peeve of mine that when you're staying at a nice hotel and the TP in the bathroom is the cheapest, lowest possible quality. For almost $200/night, you'd think they can afford Charmin. Anxiously awaiting the day upscale hotels enter the 21st century and offer free wi-fi and simple printing options.",3
2375,Turd. Super cheesy decor. Bad clientele on our stop. Wouldn't recommend to anybody. Concierge station was closed for some reason.,2
2376,"I got the opportunity to stay here for a night and was quite impressed. Everything from the touchscreen computer in the room to the lobby to the comfy bed to the staff made my stay memorable. When we first got into the room we ordered some room service (grilled chicken sandwich) which came very quickly and turned out to be delicious. The bathroom was a little bit outdated and dusty, but the shower was great and the shampoo/ conditioner products they had were amazing! The view from the hotel room was beautiful. We were in a corner room on one of the top floors looking onto the lake and down S Michigan Ave. If you can choose your room I definitely recommend this side of the building. i would stay in the Hilton again if I ever need to!",4
2377,"Old school but great.  Or should I say old school and great.  Had the privilege of staying here for four nights for a conference.  I come to Chicago a lot but have never stayed here.   Love the history of the place.  In the elevator, the small screen has a rolling quiz about the history of the hotel.  Queen Elizabeth was there, it was housing for soldiers in WWII -- tidbits like that.   The room was nice and cozy...not small, just comfortable.  I had a wet bar that I used just for leftover pizza.  No microwave but that's okay.  Bathroom was fairly small but the windowsill was perfect for a place to keep my many toiletries so that was good.   Had a great view of the lake.  The executive lounge for breakfast and snacks was wonderful.  I fell in love with the multi-option coffee machine!   It's a bit of a walk to shopping and a lot of the restaurants around Michigan Avenue.  Kind of a hike from the river.  In any season but winter, no problem.  However, there are other places nearby including the great Lou Malnati's on State Street just a couple of blocks behind and over -- go there!",4
2378,Here for the Cub's Convention. Did not get to see or stay in a room...........but I can say that the interior of the hotel is amazing. Consider this a museum and just walk around and LOOK. The Grand Ball room is extraordinary. Try the Irish Pub here..............ask for Paddy.,4
2379,"Great hotel, clean, modern, full-service hotel in perfect location. No complaints at all!",4
2380,"The interior in this place expired two decades ago.  Peeling paint on my bathroom ceiling.  The ice bucket is right out of 1980's as all the decor.  Charges for everything.  Internet @ $15 dollars a day.  Seriously, I get much more modern accomodations with everything included at a Red Roof Inn....  The Red Roof would even have a Fridge and microwave.  This place just has an empty cabinet where the must have one been a fridge... It is clean even if used up.  However, it is 3 times the price of equal or better accomodations around.  The TV's are at least modern...  If the convention I am attending wasn't being held here I would seek better accomodations for less money. Pathetic compared to what someone would expect fron a Hilton....",2
2381,"Wow, what a view we were treated to! I chose the parking package and upgraded to a lake view room, which was well worth it! Aside from the M.C. Escher like parking lot, everything else was superb. Our room was on the southeast corner of the 19th floor it had a gorgeous view of the lake and south down Michigan Ave. The room had a 42"" LG flat-screen, king size bed, and plenty of space. It also came equipped with a touch-screen computer that acted as a guide to area restaurants, attractions, and hotel service which made getting information easy and convenient. We ordered room service that evening, and as always, the service was impeccable. One little thing that stands out, and it's such a small one, but Hilton Hotels chose Peter Thomas Roth skin care products for the bathrooms and if you haven't had the opportunity to try any of them out, then do so! I cannot say enough how clean and fresh the products make your skin feel. I know, I know, this was supposed to be a hotel review, but hey!",4
2382,"This hotel was great for the location - our room had a partial view of Grant Park and Lake Michigan. However, the hotel and the rooms were in dire need of a remodel when we stayed here in November 2011. it looked like there were some renovations going on in the lobby, but our room was pretty dated. Luckily we booked this place through Priceline and got a good deal, but if I were paying the regular rate for this hotel I think I would have been pretty disappointed. The hallways were kind of dimly lit here, so overall it just wasn't a very inviting hotel. One thing that I did like was that the room actually had two bathrooms, which was something I hadn't seen before. The beds were only double beds though, so I would probably rather have had bigger beds than a second bathroom. I don't think I would purposely book this place on my own, but if I got a good deal on Priceline I wouldn't object to staying here again.",2
2383,"I stayed here this past weekend and had a room facing the lake. It was a nice and cozy room. I had access to the Executive Room for a continental breakfast which was nice. The staff members were friendly.   I like  the location of the hotel, across from Grant Park and I enjoyed the view of the lake and the city.   I didn't get a chance to experience the in-hotel restaurants so I can't comment on them but I will the next I stay hear.",4
2384,"This is the only place I stay when I go to Chicago for work. LOVE this place! It has easy access to I-94, parking is only $43/night. The staff here are very friendly. Rooms are quite nice. Some can be quite small, but they are well kept and very clean. There are many restaurant on the premises as well as around the hotel. They do serve starbucks coffee in the morning, which is always a plus. There is a gym on the 8th floor- I have yet to find time to use it but I hear it's a gem. It's currently undergoing construction on the first floor, but even with this, I'll be going back... Good service is hard to find, especially in a big city!",5
2385,"Don't stay here.  This hotel overbooked and sold our reservation to someone else before the check-in period was over.  We called and asked if we could check-in late, Customer Service said no, and that we had to be there before check-in was over to get the room.  Our rehearsal dinner went late and we had people to drive home, so we knew we were most likely not going to make it in time.  My then-fiance rushed to the hotel to check-in (and arrived prior to check-in time ending), and they had already given the room to someone else.  You would think the Customer Service Rep. would have the insight to see if the room was still available before sending us on a wild goose chase, or agree to hold the room for us!  After discovering that the room was given away, they refused to give us a refund because we didn't cancel 48 hours in advance!!!   Thankfully, we booked through Expedia and they thought what had occurred was ridiculous and processed the refund.  I would give this hotel 0 stars if I could.  This reservation was for our wedding, and the Customer Service Rep did not care.  We were not pleased - we took a cab home and slept off our hangovers in our own bed.",1
2386,"They were repairs done on the hotel (outside), I believe. The noise woke us up very early.",2
2387,"Wow, what a disappointment!  Don't want to be vulgar, but this place is a real s**t hole.  No doubt. The Hilton name implies a certain level of quality.  Yeah, but that died when Conrad Hilton passed away.  Hilton is going down rapidly and this hotel proves my point. In a city like Chicago, with all the top-shelf hotels one may choose from, this is one to avoid like the plague! The carpet in the common areas is filthy, worn and threadbare.  The chairs in the common area as the same:  dirty, worn and threadbare, and so 40 years ago.  The styles are out-of-date, the colors are sad, the paint is blistering and peeling, and overall the hotel is just depressing!  And yes, I know the historic background to this hotel and no, the 'out-of-date' motif is not my misunderstanding of the property's history.  Trust me, it's awful! The bank of elevators is stunning in its lack of thought and design.  There are ten elevators, five on each side.  As you press the ONLY elevator request button (yes, one button for all ten elevators) one notices the paint that is blistering, cracking, peeling, dirty, nicked and overall more like you'd expect to see in a horror film psychiatric hospital.  And  the detail of the ceiling's woodwork?  It's been painted so many times the relief and detail is filling in with layers upon layers of paint.  Yuk! The room itself has a nice modern flat screen television with beds that are 30 years out-of-date, bathrooms that are out-of-date and feel unclean containing soap and shampoo selections that disappoint.   The breakfast buffet in Buckingham's is another disappointing feature.  I went there three times as there was little other choice.  On Saturday I could tell the oatmeal was left over from Friday, as were the 'eggs' if you want to call them eggs.  How could I tell?  They were dry and almost had a crust on them from being in storage overnight.  NOT appetizing. The exhibit halls are dungeon-like as they are down in the bowels of the hotel. Columns block walking paths and views.  The exhibit halls become a labyrinth and, as a result, it is difficult to find much of anything.  Here for a meeting?  Good luck!  Planning a meeting here?  AVOID it. Overall, this hotel is simply as sad and depressing as it gets.  This is the type of hotel where one would expect to find the businessman (or woman) swinging from a bed sheet while hanging from the shower head in a last-ditch effort to escape this depressing property. Quick!  Run!  Run to any other hotel in the city as there  are many, many better hotels charging a similar rate.",1
2388,"I stayed here for 3 nights for a work conference, from Sunday to Wednesday. My room was quite nice. Large 42"" plasma and welcome center terminal, although the room itself was a bit small. The gym and pool are on the 8th floor, and the first 3 floors are mostly conference rooms. This place was absolutely packed with conference attendees while I was there, since there were 3-4 other large ones. Entire hotel has 1500 rooms. Wifi is ridiculously expensive, but luckily our company covered it. Parking is also ridiculously expensive (about $50/night), so you're better off parking in one of the many garages nearby. Food during the conference was pretty good, as was service.",4
2389,"I was a guest at the Rainbow Push Coalition Women's Luncheon yesterday.  The purpose of the luncheon, the panelists and the guests made it a superb event.  However the food was less remarkable.  The starter was a warm cream soup which no one could identify but did look like there were shaved pieces of mushrooms but the broth was non-descript - so agreed my tablemates.  The entree was a chicken breast salad - breast atop a piece of arugula filled with cous cous, a slice of carrot and zucchini and cubed parsnip with a vinaigrette which I poured over a few greens.   I am allergic to chicken which was fine since the breast was scorched beyond recognition - which my table mate pointed out to me since I was not eating it - I reassurred her it was no big deal due to my allergy.  The rolls were quite generic.  The saving grace of the meal was the raspberry sorbet and I am guessing the flavor here - cherry ice scoops with a few frozen blue berries.  Absolutely delicious!  Frozen solid but once melted enough well worth the wait.  The banquet staff served the food and cleared in a timely mannor in a robotic fashion - no smiles, no indication I could ask for anything else I might like - like decaf coffee.  But all in all it was about the essence of the luncheon and not the food - thank goodness.  So if you are thinking of a banquet at the Hilton and Towers I would say that if price point is an issue, this could be your place but be careful to do a tasting and try to keep it simple.",2
2390,"the husband had a conference in the city, and his organization picked up the tab for the hotel and the parking.  rad.  ""free"" instantly makes a lot of things better.  this hotel was no exception.   the parking garage was ample enough to accommodate our car every night of the week we stayed, which included st. patrick's day weekend.  even with the hotel being booked to capacity, we still had a spot.  this has not always been my experience in downtown hotels, even if it isn't a holiday weekend. the front desk staff were very pleasant and helped us liked they loved their jobs.  that was impressive alone.  my husband and i are hilton honors members, and that made a big difference at check in.  there was an enormous line of probably close to 40 people waiting to check in at the normal check in desk.  we were able to bypass it all, and go right to the honors desk.  we were up to our room in minutes.   the room was nice.  a little dated, but nice.  we were unable to book a room with only a king size bed, so we were in a room with two double beds.  the room had two full bathrooms too, which was pretty rad, because if i don't have to share a bathroom with my husband... it's a great day. there are several pubs and restaurants in the hotel and a snack bar that is both open early and closes late.  it's nice for a quick bite or a cup of coffee.  it serves starbucks coffee.  if you prefer caribou, there is one just down the block though. all in all, this is a nice hotel.  about standard price for spendy downtown hotels. if you're not from chicago, and don't know the city -- i'll tell you, this hotel is located in an awesome tourist area.  it's well within walking distance of the lakefront.  i am a runner who took advantage of that during the visit.  (there is a path that runs from the south loop to loyola unversity on the north end for runners and bikers.)  you are also walking distance from adler planetarium, the field museum, and shedd aquarium.  if you are looking to go out or get a decent dinner, the south loop is not what it used to be.  having lived in chicago for many years, i am always surprised how neighborhoods change and evolve.  in this case, the south loop is very different than it was even 10 years ago.  there are a lot of bistros, cafes, and bars for all kinds of different tastes.  going to the northern tourist destinations, like water tower place, will involve a fairly hefty hike (but it's through the city, so if you don't mind a trek, it's a nice walk).  the el is within blocks of the hotel though, and is so easy to navigate that there is no reason to pay ridiculous cab fare.",4
2391,"As Bill B said on 10/20/11, do not waste your money on this place. I paid around $250 a night for a small room with a King sized bed The bathroom was clean Sheets were clean Minimal amenities My room had no mini bar just a half fridge that was empty and not even plugged in. Room service selections are minimal and not too tasty...breakfast faired a bit better because lets be real, scrambled eggs are hard to mess up The absolute WORST was their terrible internet service which they make you pay through the nose for ($8 an HOUR!!!) which kept cutting in an out during a business meeting. I travel to Chicago frequently and I will NOT return to this hotel EVER. This place is a tremendous disappointment and for the money you can stay at a nicer more up to date hotel with better amenities, service, and internet that works. I consider this place a major FAIL",2
2392,"This is the only hotel I stay at when hubby and I visit Chicago each year. we love that they have a large indoor pool, gym, and hot tubs - great spot for me to unwind and relax.",5
2393,"Looks like they renovated / updated their rooms.  Overall it was definitely an update for the better.  I stayed here before in a much larger room, but our experience this time was a lot better considering many of the items in our room back then including the furniture, the TV (a tube tv) were outdated. Rooms now features a fairly good sized flat screen tv, computer that has your name on the title screen, which was a nice touch.   I like a more modern approach of using that computer (sort of like a kiosk) to look for nearby attractions, see room service options, look for restaurants and numerous other things.  It gives you more info about what's around and what to do around the area. The downside is that in order to use the web browser, they charge a ridiculous amount.  In this day and age, when we are hooked on technology, I sort of see this as nickle and diming.  Really annoying. Anyway, I got the parking and room package at a decent price so it was nice to go in and out of parking without hassle.   Overall, I'm satisfied with our stay.  Got some good rest and I actually booked to get away from the burbs and spend some time in the city with my wife on our anniversary.  This place served it's purpose and everything was solid.",4
2394,"This place has been totally remodeled. The rooms are awesome, and there are nice views of Grant Park and the lake. This is now nicer than most of the hotels on N Michigan Ave. that cost twice as much. They just need to get some more restaurants and shopping nearby.",5
2395,"As an out of towner, this was a lovely place to stay for a short trip.  There were tons of pubs and restaurants within walking distance, not to mention the park.  The room was clean, the amenities were about what you'd expect for a Hilton, and the beds were like clouds!  Be careful though, the parking situation is pricey - $45 to do it yourself and almost $60 to valet per night.  If you find the Hilton through a bargain website, make sure to add parking to your price.   *tip* if you DID happen to valet, don't pay to have the hotel hold on to your bags during that extra time after check out if you still want to see a little more of the city before you leave - the valet folks will bring your car around, put your bags in, and then park it again so you can explore baggage free.",4
2396,"Whenever we stay in Chicago we stay at the Chicago Hilton - what a grand old majestic hotel. Across from Grant Park. My family of 4 squeezes into a single room with double beds - BUT that type of room has 2 enormous bathrooms with marble. Rooms are clean and since it's an old hotel with thick walls - quiet. Like the other reviewers stated - staff is friendly and very good, but prices for amenities and restaurants are outrageous. But that's a great excuse to get out and shop and restaurant hop in Chicago.",4
2397,"Very elegant hotel in the South Loop of Chicago, right off the Harrison subway exit on the Red Line. Very good location, with easy access public transportation. Our room was big and clean, with a wonderful view. We actually had two views, one of Lake Michigan , the other of downtown. I would request a corner room, we stayed in room 1169 if you would like to request that room. The only downfall is you have to pay an extra fee for access to the gym. It was $15/day and when I peeked in there wasn't anything spectacular. The pool is an indoor lap pool with two jacuzzi spa but it has a nice outside area where you can lay out. The service was friendly and fast and the hotel bar is fully equipped. I would definitely recommend this hotel to visitors of Chicago who want a convenient hotel. It was walking distance from Buckingham Fountain and right across Grant Park.",4
2398,"I stayed here for a staycation and was really disappointing.  We were on the executive level so we had access to refreshments and a continental breakfast.  The executive floor is crawling with kids who are un-supervised.  I'm fine with kids but there were no adults to be found to supervise them and then no one was staffing the executive room on the Hilton side.  It was rather frustrating.   The beds were worn down and the bathrooms were pretty small.  Ours only had one bathroom, but I've heard some have two.  The room itself was also small.   There was a stain on our sheets so we ended up sleeping on the to sheet because by the time we realized the stain it was midnight and we were exhausted. I guess I just think for the cost of this hotel there are better options in this city.",2
2399,"Great hotel! Went to Chicago for Lollapalooza. Stayed at this Hotel because it was across the street from the concert. When the girl at the desk realized I was in town for the concert, she upgraded me and gave me a suite on Michigan Ave overlooking the whole venue! Great, big clean suite. The people who worked there were really cool.. 2 good bars down stairs. Great food, as well!!!",5
2400,"Stayed here last February and again this New Year's Eve eve for a friend's wedding. The reception was at Zapatista a few blocks away. The good news for us is that they allow dogs, even big dogs. For a fee of $50, we could take our 50lb+ Labradoodle (or so the rescue said) puppy with us.         I know from our last visit that the hotel gym is great, the biggest gym I have seen in any Hotel, a real gym, not just a universal machine and a couple of treadmills. It had power racks, rowers, full range of dumbbells and plates (more but my memory of a year ago is faulty).        We had the breakfast buffet in the morning. It was free and ok, but not exciting. I get excited about a good breakfast buffet. I think any calories consumed before 11am do not count.       The location of the Hotel was great for our purpose, but it is a little south of the real downtown. It is right across from the park and very close to the Grant Bark Park, which we used.       The rates were great for both stays; $80 for the first stay through Priceline and $180 for the second stay (that includes the $50 dog fee).",4
2401,"Though I've never stayed in this hotel, I've been here for a dinner event and really enjoyed myself. The food was good, the service was good, and the venue is quite elegant. Definitely take cues from other jilted guests -- carry your junk with you or lock it down. Though it may look it from the inside, you're not in Oz and your crap will get jacked if you leave it out in the open. Take a tad bit of personal responsibility and you won't find yourself trying to get the hotel to reimburse for your lapse in common sense. Seriously, I read that review and wonder if it's the same woman whose kid hit my car with a shopping cart and then gave *me* the stink eye when I asked her what gives. Also, the acoustics were good.",3
2402,"for the 280 a night we paid (includes taxes), not really a great value.  kind of dated interior, noisy being right above the train lines, old crappy hvac.  not to mention 45 bucks a night parking.",3
2403,"This Hotel is Not great at all. Shitty staffs, well RUBEN and his fat security Anthony. Along with some geeky Asian guy. They gave me and my family a hard time checking in. So we still manage to get a room there and the room was horrible. Double tree is far more nicer than this crappy hotel.",1
2404,"First off, I reserved my room and accidentally reserved the room for 2 nights - Friday and Saturday. The bad thing was my flight came in Saturday so I called the hotel and explained they could give my room to someone else on Friday and I would just eat the cost and still stay Saturday. When my boyfriend and I arrive at the hotel the front desk told me that they cancelled my reservation because I didn't show up on Friday. I told them that I spoke with someone about the mixup and after about 15 minutes of standing at the desk the manager comes out. They said it was their fault and gave us a room. I was almost in tears from frustration but they finally set us up with a room so I was happy - for a little while. After exploring the hotel we went back to our room and tried to turn the heat up but it wasn't working so we had to call up maintenance to fix the heater. It probably took them an hour to figure out the problem and fix it. My boyfriend and I stepped out for 10 minutes to pick up some alcohol and when we came back the room smelled like burnt hair. Gross! It was getting late so we just decided to spray a bunch of my perfume to cover the smell. I was so stressed out that we decided to leave the Hilton and find another hotel. The overall look and feel of the hotel is great, but unfortunately my experience was not so 'hot'.",2
2405,"Having won my Chicago HQ off of Priceline for $67 a night, I was a bit disappointed when it was unveiled.  For hotels, I'm more of a contemporary modern type of guy and the photos for this place were definitely ""historical Old World"" luxury.  But, the old gal can surprise a jaded Pink Mafia member like me.   I had woken up at 345 AM to make a 7 AM flight (Why the heck did I do this on my vacation?) and then used public transit to get into the city.  I walked the remaining 5 blocks dragging my suitcase through the streets of Chicago for all to see.  Sort of a paleta man but with underwear, t-shirts, and shoes instead. Entering the building from a side entrance, the place is monstrously big (taking up a whole city block) with dark carpet and wood everywhere, shops, various public rooms, meeting rooms, and staircases galore.  Finally, I hunted down the front desk which was equally big.  But, Sara was warm, cordial, and professional - with her tone, she was able to scale down the hotel so that all that mattered was our chat. There are 14 elevators to take you to your room:  4 of them are reserved for the HHonors members' floors while I, as a member of the riff-raff, had to 'fight' for one of the other 10 elevators.  In my 2.5 days there, I never had to share one with anyone so those of you wanting to hear about ""Elevator Fight Club"" will be disappointed. Requested a wired internet room (only 30% of their rooms are capable of this - but all are WiFi enabled).  You get choices of broadband internet:  premium, advanced, basic, and hourly.  Rates per day:  $19.99, $17.99, $14.99, and $2.50 respectively.  Yes, no free internet.  Yes, it is nuts.  Forewarned is forearmed. My double/double room had 2 full bathrooms at either end of the room.  Why?  I don't know.  Reading up on the hotel, it turns out that only 300 of the 1,544 rooms have this double bathroom thing going on.  So, for you bathroom-philes, here's your personal Nirvana.  Request and enjoy.  Just for kicks, I took turns using each bathroom.  Hey, I was on vacation. The bedding and linens are upgraded with Sealy Serenity beds, high-numbered thread counts, and a good assortment of new pillows.  The bath fixtures are gold-colored so popular decades ago but functional.  My standard huge armoire had an old-school TV in it.  No in-room safe, though.  I declined the mini-bar key so if there were bundles of cash or jewelry from the Titanic in there I can't tell you. It was stuffy when I opened the door so, being a resident of the South, I knew that the first order of business was to turn on the air conditioning to the maximum setting.  When I returned from lunch two hours later, it was still unpleasant.  I called the customer care hotline:  Ann promptly answered within 2 rings, apologized when I explained the situation, and promised to dispatch maintenance immediately.  He was at my door within 5 minutes and fixed the issue within 10 minutes.  Ann called back to follow up within 5 minutes departure of the maintenance guy.  I thanked her for the prompt service and follow up.  This was a memorable part of the great service - they really do care, even if you low-balled them on Priceline. Fronting South Michigan Avenue and Grant Park, there are plenty of buses and cabs available if you want to get to other parts of the city.  The ""El"" (elevated train) is a few blocks away.  The well-designed Millennium Park, the stupendous Art Institute, and the amazing Cloud Gate sculpture (commonly called ""the Bean"") are also an easy 15-minute walk away.  Overall, the Hilton Chicago is a good value for $67 per night for even a non-traditional guy like me.",3
2406,"Location. Location. Location. This hotel sits on the ever famous Michigan Mile, and is within blocks of  the red line and other trains. It's within walking distance of Grant Park, Dunkin Donuts, restaurants, shopping, banks, museums...do I keep going?   Size. Size.Size. Be warned, this is not your mom and pop hotel. It's massive. Conventions are held here year round.  I stayed during some kind of a real estate banking gig, and I was almost swallowed by the seat of suits...not that I am complaining. Bigger is better, and in this case you can bet the farm on it. My room was spacious. 2 beds, and 2 matching bathrooms. Yup, 2 matching bathrooms! Girls need not worry about having to share sink space. The Extra's: Customer service was stellar. The housekeeping staff, the room service, the front desk, the bell hop, and even the guy opening my door and getting my cab. I was impressed. Originally, I checked into the 12th floor but was not too thrilled about the smoke smell in room.  Not sure if the past guest was smoking or the 10th floor was creeping through my vent.  I called the front desk and was moved promptly to the 17th floor. I appreciated the immediate attention to my concern.   The Filler: -1 star for $50 dollar for late check out fee to 1PM and $75 to 3PM. Yeah...wait what? I also didn't appreciate having to pay a $2 fee for each bag I stowed.  It helped, but shouldn't this service be free? Nonetheless, this hotel is historic. It's spacious. It's old school. It's friendly.  Respect the game, and enjoy the craziness. If you got the cash, stay here.",4
2407,"I didn't stay here, but the Lyric's opera ball was held in the Grand Ballroom of the Hilton Chicago. This is an older building with beautiful architecture.  Ornate accents, grand staircases and beautiful details, the theme is Victorian classic.  The Grand Ballroom is really beautiful and ideal for a bar mitzvah or wedding. The exterior of the hotel is just OK. For hotel food, it was very very good.  We had a petite filet that was cooked perfectly and scalloped potatoes that were superb.  The dessert stole the show.  A dark chocolate and pistachio mousse cake was amazingly rich and delicious.   House champagne was a bit sweet, but decent.",4
2408,"I would not recommend this venue for any type of professional event or conference.  This review is of my experience as an exhibitor at a professional conference in July 2010. The 3 day conference was held in the Grand Ballroom for over 300 professionals in private equity, investment banking and mergers and acquisitions.   As an exhibitor/vendor at a professional conference, the main goal is to display your product or services to attract the attention of the conference attendees.  For 3 days I was at the hotel from early morning to early evening working as an exhibitor for one of my clients.  Because I am self employed, I brought my own laptop to use at the conference table.  This was to be used to show attendees the web based services that my clients had to offer.  There were over 20 exhibitors in the Grand Ballroom and many of them had laptops, lcd screens and other electronic equipment on their tables.   There was zero communication from the Hilton Chicago to inform us that we should have any concerns when leaving this equipment unattended. On the third and final day of the conference, I had my iPhone plugged into my laptop to charge and spent the morning at the table.  I had gotten up a few times to network around the room, and left the computer on the table, just as I had the previous two days.  Around 10:45am I got up to use the restroom and returned to my exhibitor table to find that in less than five minutes, my laptop and attached cell phone had been taken. I immediately reported this to security.  They were very slow in the process of questioning me and when I asked them about the security cameras, they informed me that the ONE camera they had in the Grand Ballroom does not cover the section of the room where my table was.  This piece of information alone screams DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THE HILTON CHICAGO.  How can a hotel in Chicago on Michigan Ave only have one security camera in their GRAND BALLROOM?  Not smart, not secure, not safe. In most situations I would never EVER leave my belongings unattended.  In a situation where you are in a professional work environment and your equipment is being used for work, there should be a feeling of security.  A person should not have to pack up their electronic equipment every time they need to use the rest room.  After over a month of communication with the hotel security, the only resolution they had was to compensate me for less than half of what it would cost to replace the items.  Their insurance policy stated that the loss was not covered because I was not a guest of the hotel.  (any person who walks into that hotel and pays to walk into that hotel should be considered a guest) I was treated as if I was neglectful and irresponsible yet they offered to partially compensate me to shut me up?  Bad business practice in my opinion.   Unprofessional, unethical and unsecured.  Highly DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1
2409,"Although I did not stay at the Chicago Hilton, my employer had two galas in the ballroom in late October. All I can say is my oh my, do I wish I had the cash to have my wedding in this place! Stunning from floor to ceiling, with glitzy gold and mirrors everywhere to reflect the shimmering light. I could do without the disco ball, though; odd decor choice for such a beaux-arts-type venue.",4
2410,"I'm such a loser.  I was supposed to book a suite here 6 months ago for the election and I freaking forgot.  Not to fear, using my HH Diamond status, I pulled four, yes FOUR, rooms on my HH points from this totally sold out hotel a mere 4 days ago so we could go to the Barack rally in Grant Park and not have to deal with the Thunderdomish traffic getting out of the loop afterwards...I love you Hilton Honors Program! The rooms are a bit smaller than at other Hilton locations, but very nicely appointed and comfortable, they appear to have undergone renovation recently.  Internet is $14.95 per 24 hours, which I find to be rather exorbitant, but it is very fast. This Hilton still has a single smoking floor, thank god, so smokers, book away!   The Executive Lounge on the 24th floor has a great view of Grant Park and is a comfortable place to spend some time.  The attendants are very friendly and they keep it stocked with soda (Coke!), coffee, tea, bottled water, cookies & snacks all day.  More substantial snacks are available during the Honors Reception from 5-7 each evening, but this is one of those Hiltons that actually charges for cocktails during the reception, so boo on that.  If you are a Hilton Diamond, skip the lobby and check in on the 24th floor, no lines and the concierges up there are very fast and friendly. Several restaurants on the property, including the infamous Kitty O'Sheas, Chicago's unofficial dem rallying point during election cycles and my personal favorite place to watch election returns.  Food at all the restaurants is above average for hotel fare, if a bit pricey.  I really like the prime rib sandwich at Kitty O'Sheas - quite nicely done for a hotel bar, tender and you generally get the meat cooked the way you request it. Excellent staff overall, they did an absolutely amazing job dealing with the capacity crowds on hand for Obama and maintained a friendly and helpful demeanor in the face of crazed and drunken Dems celebrating the end of our political exile.  Although the Drake is still my favorite Hilton property in the city, this is a close second and a great option if you are looking for a nice hotel in the loop.",5
2411,Thanks to Jenny Z. I got to stay in one of the four rooms she got from her Hilton Diamonds Reward Program and just the fact that they pulled four rooms for her the night or two before the rally makes me like them even more. The room was nice. I thought it was larger than other rooms I've been in but can't say how it compares to other Hilton locations. Also the beds were unbelievably comfortable and the bathroom was huge. They had a well stocked mini bar but the key was hidden from me and I was not allowed in. How well I guess we did have a tub of booze anyway! The hotel staff was very nice and tried to be as accommodating as possible. They were so busy but everyone was very nice and took things in stride. I arrived via cab and as soon as I got out I had four different men wanting to help me with one bag. They opened the doors and directed me to check in all with smiles on their faces and a ton of people with more luggage than I walking around everywhere. If I can expect this kind of service at every Hilton I will be a very happy girl!,5
2412,"WOW!  I stayed here this past June for a company event.  I was up in the very very nice Presidential Suite for two nights.  This place was awesome!  I had the lake view from my room, 2 beds, 2 bathrooms.  Of all the places I've been to in the United States, this is the best hotel ever!  Room service was prompt, the food was delicious, the employees were extremely friendly and courteous. If you're looking to book a company event, this is a great place to do it.  This place will make an impression!",5
2413,"Reminiscent of the gradiose hotels of the early 1900s... Beautiful high ceilings, gilt wood, lobby, pool (though it closed early), two smaller hot tubs, work out center, and room with city views. My boyfriend and I recently stayed there on valentine's day (which is a thursday, so...) for only $90 through priceline. The hotel just isn't at capacity in the winter and you can get great rates. We wandered through the spacious, empty lobby and stumbled on a grand ballroom, complete with balconies and elaborate, glass chandeliers. Great space for a wedding. Be aware... parking is almost $50 a night, truly a rip-off!! But the location can't be beat. Other downsides: most of the hotel's restaurants close in winter and Kitty O'Shea's, while open until 11 for food, was just not that good. But extremely affordable! Breakfast menu from room service was the only real disappointment, boring and veerry basic We were placed on the ""Executive Floor"", which I would almost certainly request if you can. They are higher floors with much better views. Little details in the service make a big difference to me. For example, I called to request tea in the morning and they brought up an enormous selection promptly, complete with creamers and to-go cups. I felt like Michael Jackson!! that's what they would give Michael Jackson. People say his star has fallen, but wouldn't you just poop yourself if he was staying in your hotel?? A note - You can buy passes to their gym/pool, not that I would ever work out in a million years. But some might. Some might. A 3-day pass to extensive facilities within walking distance to the Loop was $15, extremely reasonable. Back to the room: Warm colors, dark wood, smallish space, freshly tiled bathroom, white linens and comforter. Cable, but no DVD player. USA Today outside our door in the morning and check-out via phone from the room topped off the night. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. To hell with modern decor!",4
2414,"I was here for NYE 2006/7 and did the whole ""stay at the hotel/go to the party in the hotel"" thing. An awesome idea, if I do say so. Not having to worry about how you were getting home was awesome. Knowing the bed you were going to sleep in was probably made by fucking angels was ALSO awesome. And the fact that the double rooms have two bathrooms was super convenient and a really nice touch. We had one minor issue with the hotel, and it revolved around them charging us for things we didn't take from the mini-bar, but that was resolved with a quick trip to the customer service desk. I'd stay here again, but only if I suddenly became very wealthy and can afford to do so. The price is really the only thing keeping this place from a 5-star review.",4
2415,"This is a very nice hotel, an I got an unexpected bonus. First off in clear violation of the Hilton booking rules, I reserved the cheapest room possible for one person...with the intent of having about 7 people stay in it. We needed a place to crash after a friend's birthday celebration. They either didn't realize when I led the field trip up to the room, or just looked the other way. In either case...cool. I have Hilton Diamond status, so they automatically upgraded me to a lake view room, which was nice. It also had two bathrooms, which was odd, but nice for all the people. The room was nice - very comfortable beds, good sized and with a nice view as well. The lobby was quite impressive, very plush, and staff were incredibly helpful. i was not able to try any of the restaurants, since I was with friends who had other (liquid) dining plans. There was also an interesting goody in the room - a $50 off coupon (with qualifying purchase) at a costume jewelery store in the lobby. I offered it to a friend, and I went down with her since I wanted to get something to munch on later. (Forget paying for the mini-bar stuff) Who do we run in to in the lobby? Fonzie. Seriously. Arthur Winkler. Nice guy, too - I have pictures to prove it. So. Between good service, very nice surroundings, a free upgrade (granted, not just spontaneous, but due to my history), and a celebrity siting, I highly recommend this hotel. Although your personal amount of Fonzie may vary on your next stay.",4
2416,"For starters - we got a great deal on this hotel from Hotwire. The location is ideal - close to Grant & Millenium Parks, 2 blocks from Dunkin Donuts, close to shopping and a short cab ride to Rush Street. The hotel itself is beautiful, although the rooms are dated. The biggest blow, though, was parking. $55 for valet and $45 for self. At that point I made a mental note to never complain about parking in LA ever again, and then went down the street and parked for 24 hours for about $20. What made me absolutely the happiest about our room was the fact that it had TWO bathrooms. We had a room with two double beds and TWO bathrooms. Be still, my beating heart. Also, all the hotel staff were helpful and accommodating (except with late checkout they said they'd have to charge if it were past noon.) Also, I had some sort of an allergy attack and benadryl at the gift shop was $17. Yes. $17. So I walked the half a mile to Jewel-Osco and it was all good.",4
2417,"My fiancee and I stayed here for a conference that she was attending in the building.  I was expecting a certain level of service that goes with the Hilton name.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  Our non-smoking room that we booked over a month in advance was not available so we got stuck in a stinky smoking room.  However, we were told that someone would be in within 2 hours to provide an ionizing service to get rid of the smell.  Three and a half hours later, no one showed up and we were ready to go to sleep. In addition to this, I was shocked that we were charged for Internet.  We had stayed at a Comfort Inn earlier in the year and we got free Internet.  Here we were at the friggin' Hilton and we had to pay $4 an hour to use the Internet or $0.69 a MINUTE to use the system downstairs?  Ugh.  You've got to be kidding me. To make matters worse, our smoking room was to be changed to a non-smoking room the next day.  After making arrangements with the concierge, I was told that someone would be up within 15 minutes to bring me the keys to our new room.  An hour goes by and no one shows up.  I finally storm down to the desk to find out what happened and get it straightened out. The rooms weren't even that great.  They were pretty average and still had old CRT TVs.  Like I said, I expected a certain level of service from the Hilton and it just did not deliver.  If I'm paying this much for a room, I expect it to be worth it.  This was not.  Needless to say, we'll never stay in a Hilton hotel again.",1
2418,"The reputation far exceeds the reality of this place. Yes, it's old, and yes, famous people have stayed here. That's about it. The rooms are NOT luxurious in any way. The cleaning people didn't even do a very good job. Our tub was always clogged and gross. And the elevators? Horrendous. You'd think with that many people staying at the hotel, they'd have fast moving elevators. No way. The best thing about the Chicago Hilton is the guy who'll call a taxi for you and open the door. That was the highlight of my stay at this hotel.",2
2419,"Want to stay at a hotel that nickel and dimes you for everything?  Stay at the Hilton Towers in the South Loop. Free WiFi?  No...that is $2.50/hour or  $15-20 a day (yes, they do throttle depending on how much you want to spend) Tea or coffee for all in a room for 4?  No, they only leave 2 tea bags and 2 single serving coffees (capresso) in each room. Want to take a relaxing bath?  Not easily done in a 6-inch deep tub. How about chill at the pool?  Not if you don't want to be overrun with kids. Want an easy walk to Chicago nightlife?  You are at the far south end of the Loop, and really need to be further north to make this convenient in the winter. As a romantic getaway from our place (we live in the city) this was not it.  Room service leaves a lot to be desired if you don't want to spend $100.   Don't get me wrong, this place had its hey-day back in the early 90s when renovated.   They could really use to update the place again.  You can tell the Hilton Towers is now designed to efficiently suck every dollar out of the tourists and business people stay here for conventions. 2-stars because the place was clean and they allow you to bring your dog.",2
2420,"I want to steal their pillows. I'm used to staying at more budget-friendly hotels, but when planning my short stay in Chicago, this Hilton was actually cheaper than some of the other hotels downtown, so I jumped on it. I really enjoyed my stay here. I was allowed to check in early when I arrived, which was very much appreciated, as I was a hot ass mess from walking and dragging my suitcase the few blocks from the blue line. I asked about a room with a view, but it was another $25/night, so I passed. My room did not have the infamous (?) two bathroom setup, but my one bathroom was just fine. My water pressure was great, even up on the 19th floor, and my fixtures weren't tarnished and looked really nice, unlike what some of the other reviewers experienced. The bed was super comfortable, and I loved how white and crisp the sheets and duvet were. And their pillows - oh my God, I wanted to steal them all, they felt like clouds under my head. The location of the hotel was nice, just a few blocks away from the Harrision red line stop, so it is super convenient to get to/from places pretty quickly. What I really liked was the check out process. Maybe other hotels have this, but I've never experienced it. Not only did I not have to wait in line to check out, like the mass of people that were doing so when I left on Sunday morning, but I was able to print out my boarding pass for free! All I had to do was check out through my TV, then send my boarding pass to their print station in the lobby. Genius, and pain free. When the mood hits me to get back up to Chicago, I will definitely be checking out the Hilton again.",4
2421,Stayed at this place for a week. Everyone was super nice and I was extremely happy with everything. The only complaint is that they make you pay a lot for parking.,4
2422,"I've been coming here since the Boulevard Room had ice shows in the 1960's. And I still like this place quite a lot. Last night we met before and after Daughter NO. 2's high school graduation in the lobby bar for drinks and eats. Great service, very good enough, basic bar food which everyone enjoyed. The furniture and the air conditioning made it Wonderful!! A great little ""off the beaten path"" (NOT) to hang out.",4
2423,"Decent hotel, I stayed there for business and I am kind of a hotel snob so maybe this is why I only gave it 3 stars, but it was being renovated and everything smelled of wet paint.   Also not that I expect to be upgraded every time, but I do have Hilton status and usually am, and almost expected to be based on other yelper's experiences at this hotel - except this time, all I got was a free .5L bottle of water.   So I am fishing around for a .5L bottle of water in the mini fridge - didn't see one - there was a smaller Evian and a MOLD COVERED 12oz perrier can in the back.  Gross. My room's fire alarm was so sensitive that me taking a shower with the door cracked set it off - at first I thought ok, it will stop in a second - WRONG - 4 full minutes later, I got out of the shower, waved a towel under the fire alarm for a bit, and it FINALLY went off.  I was a little concerned that walking down 19 flights of stairs if it got evacuated would kill my night, so I am glad it finally stopped shrieking at me - but damn, if I wasn't worried for a few minutes.   So yeah.  Cool looking historic building, pretty good location (except not really near any EL stops) - but I won't stay there again unless desperate.",3
2424,"What I want in a hotel might differ from most people. I would much rather have an interesting hotel, grand lobby, a sense of history, etc.. and a small but adequate room rather than a boring hotel with spacious rooms (Yes I'm looking right at you Embassy Suites). The Hilton Chicago is everything you would want in a classic hotel. - Scenic location - Amazing architecture   - Humongous lobby   - History oozing out of the walls like blood out of the elevators in The Shining Scenes from The Fugitive, My Best Friends Wedding, Primal Fear, Home Alone 2 and Road to Perdition were all filmed at the Hilton Chicago. They also boast that every president since FDR has walked through their doors. If it's good enough for Dr. Richard Kimble and Gerald Ford shouldn't it be good enough for you? I don't want to forget about our room completely though, after all it's the only hotel room I've had with two bathrooms and that comes in very handy when getting ready in the morning. It's just when I'm traveling the last thing I want to do is stay in the hotel room. I'd much rather be out experiencing the city or at the very least having a drink in the lobby. The Hilton Chicago has two bars that stay open late. Kitty O'Sheas and the Lakeside Green Lounge. If you want to watch a game or news hit the lounge otherwise you're better off at Kitty O'Sheas a faux Irish pub. Also if you want a nice free view find your way to the roof of the hotel for views of Lake Michigan, Grant Park, Navy Pier and the entire city behind you.",5
2425,"This is a great hotel to stay in.  The beds are soft and warm, and usually the views are great (if you're lucky enough to get a lake side room!).  The check in was lighting fast, and that's amazing, considering I only come here once a year for the Cub Convention (think Great America lines!).  Room service, and maid service are super quick, attentive and courteous. Only complaint is that it's SUPER dry and hot in the rooms, and I received a smoking room, even though I asked for a non-smoking room. :-(",4
2426,"I was fortunate enough to stay here for my birthday back in December. It is located right on Michigan Ave across from the Lake and the parks! Great location for a view, but in terms of things around it, there are not many shops or restaurants. The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays. One thing I didn't like was the ceilings of the lobby were really low, but there was a beautiful area with a huge Christmas tree. I got this hotel on Priceline and when we checked in, we were able to get a room with a gorgeous view. I was so happy! When we walked in, there was a computer that was playing musiak and had a personalized greeting on the front. Everything was nice and clean and I considered the bed to be comfy. Also, do not come to Chicago with a car. Parking is ridiculously expensive. 40 bucks and up each night. I would love to stay here again next time I'm in town.",4
2427,"A below-average Hilton.  Don't book a block of rooms here for your wedding or other event. 1.  If you're planning wedding or other event for which you need a block of rooms, don't do it here.  They will claim to give you a ""good rate.""  Then you will find yourself either (A) explaining to your guests why should pay a higher rate than necessary when they can get a better rate on their own, or (B) eating the cost of the rooms you reserved because your anticipated guests all got the lower outside rate.   2.  Then when you do get someone to agree to help you out and give you a more reasonable rate, you will find that the rest of the hotel ""didn't get the memo"" and spend several hours on the phone.  You call your contact, who will assure you that it will be taken care of immediately, only to find that nothing continues to happen.  Then you get to call again.  I think of it as the ""Chicago Hilton"" cycle. 3.  And this is totally petty and unrelated, but a friend of mine stayed here and when she walked into her room, she found poo, i.e. #2, on the floor of her supposedly clean hotel room.  These things happen, it's true.  But it makes you think.  (They were, admittedly, kind enough to give her a different room.) 4.  The have a nice pool that my mom likes.",2
2428,"The staff is great, fast and efficient. The elevators were slow on the upper levels. The rooms are large enough, but they need some updating - the rooms are clean but for a Flagship hotel it should be updated. The pool and health club are excellent, I recommend the pool.",4
2429,"I have been to the Hilton Chicago on several occasions, and all times  were for work.  The first time was in 2009 for my association's Interim BOT meeting.  The second time was for a site-visit for my association's Annual Conference, and the third time was for the actual conference. On a personal level as a guest: 2009 - I had to stay a night for work and I found the room, as well as the hotel, to be dark, out-dated, and almost haunted.  I was so freaked out in my room, which was a basic king room, that I stayed up and watched The Hangover and ordered a pizza through room service.  I ended up sleeping with the light on (yes, I am scared of the dark and this hotel room didn't help) 2011 - Stayed here the last night of my conference and got a pretty sweet room.  It was a King Jr. Suite and it had a view of museum campus and the lake.  Too bad I was working and couldn't really enjoy it for long.  I still found the room to be small, but less dark and out-dated than 2009. Either way, this would NOT be my first pick if I was visiting Chicago.  The hotel has a lot of history, and certainly has one of the most beautiful ballrooms I have seen as well as amazing suites - both the Conrad and the Imperial Suites are breath-taking, but an average person would not be paying to stay there.  If anything, I say visit the hotel on a tour, but dont' pay the money to stay there unless 1) you get a great deal or 2) can afford one of the suites.  While the hotel isn't centrally located to many Chicago attractions it is close to museum campus, the infamous Buddy Guy Legends, and is a short cab ride to the Magnificent Mile. On a professional level as a meeting planner: 1) The exhibit space isn't ideal for exhibitors especially if you are on the Lower Level because of all the columns.  The meeting rooms, with the exception of the 2nd and 3rd floor, are small and cramped and make you feel like you're in elementary school again. 2) The prices are ridiculous - I have never been to a property that charges so much for a gallon of coffee!  We definitely had to have a serious conversation with them in regards to pricing for items such as coffee, internet, and electrical.  As a planner, consider yourself warned, and be prepared to discuss bringing prices down and compromising in certain areas. 3) The staff - everyone from the front desk, facilities, banquets, the blue coats, to covention services and even the chef and GM are beyond amazing!  I have worked meetings at a lot of properties and the Hilton Chicago staff are definitely up there.  They were extremely accommodating, professional, and a true pleasure to work with.   If I am still with the association in 2014, I look forward to going back just to be able to work with their staff.",3
2430,"I've never stayed at this Hilton before.  Usually I'm close to the river, but I was in town for a conference at the Hilton and the conference rate was good, so I got to check the place out. It's a big, old hotel.  It's well maintained, but there are things about big, old hotels that aren't great.  It's a long walk from your room to the elevators.  If you want a hot shower, you'll have to let the water run for a while.  If you want a great view, you probably won't have it.  Check in was efficient, housekeeping usually gets it right, and the catering was decent enough that we didn't go out to dinner after eating the snacks at our conference reception.  The rooms are ready for a refresh, but the public spaces were impressive. John McCain and his entourage were in the hotel for a while in the afternoon and evening.  Security was there, and they did a good job of not inconveniencing people who were there for other reasons.  Supposedly when this hotel was built, it was the biggest in the world.  That's not hard to believe and the staff manages things well but if I could pick a hotel for next time, I'd pick a newer one that was maybe a mile further north.",2
2431,"I've never stayed here- but I do VIP hotel accommodations for perhaps the most powerful businessman in the world.  I've visited every luxury hotel in Chicago, and intensely scrutinized every Presidential suite and penthouse- and I think the most luxurious is the Hilton Presidential suite. Their sales rep for our request took us on a full tour of the hotel, gave us historical background as we toured (really fascinating history), and a very elegant front entrance off of Michigan Ave.  A nice touch- the United Airlines check-in kiosk by the hotel check-in counter.  You can kill 2 birds withone stone before you even head out to O'Hare. The views are stunning if your room faces East.   The hotel is beautiful, the Presidential suite is exquisite, and their sales staff was intensely helpful ad friendly and paid us a lot of attention.  I appreciate their help- as my list of questions and inquiries before the VIPs arrive is quite extensive.",4
2432,"I'm actually not that impressed with the Hilton Chicago, where I've stayed the last two nights, but it might be because the conference I'm attending is at the Palmer House. For $260 a night, the Hilton is just a bit too little. The lobby area isn't that great, there are way too many elevator banks, and it's occasionally unclear which elevators you can use to go to which floors. Then, when I arrived, they'd assigned me to a smoking room, even though I'd requested a nonsmoking room. The room didn't smell too badly, so I didn't bother changing rooms at the end of the day yesterday, but the room itself was confusing. Two beds, OK. But two bathrooms? I've never stayed in a hotel room with two bedrooms before. Which one do I use? Which one do they clean? Bizarre. That said, the wifi was relatively inexpensive, and the signal was strong. CNN was on the TV. And the alarm clock worked. I slept well, the Net worked, and that's about all that mattered. There have to be better hotels.",3
2433,"I stayed here a week ago and was lucky to use some of my Hilton points and was upgraded to the Executive Floor on the 24th floor. The first thing you notice when you walk into the hotel is the decor in the lobby, which seems to span on forever into ballrooms, meeting rooms, restaurants, and small shops. The colors are very warm and comforting as are the staff and everyone that greets you. My room had two beds and two bathrooms which was a bit excessive, but it comes with the whole upgrade. The view was decent as I was on the 24th floor, but I was caddy cornered between two points of the huge building that jut out and it was kind of a limited view. The room was very clean and everything was top class as Hiltons usually are. One thing of note was the gym. It was absolutely huge. If you are into working out when you travel you will truly enjoy the gym experience here. Even though the weights and machines may be a little old, there is HUGE variety for a hotel gym and even a mini track that goes around all the equipment. Plenty of TV's and a great view of the city make working out easy. The location of the hotel is superb. Plenty of restaurants in the Loop as well as shops and sites to see everywhere. My only complaint is the concierge. I needed to extend my stay by a day and I went to ask him what could be done. He said the hotel was booked and then gave me the number for http://hotels.com. THAT is shocking. I'm a Diamond VIP member at Hilton and the last thing I want to hear a concierge tell me is to call http://hotels.com. I'm not trying to be rude or cocky or anything, but he could have at least referred me to another Hilton or Hilton family hotel. Apart from the concierge, I loved the hotel and can't wait to be back.",4
2434,"This really feels like an old-time big city hotel.  Its grand in many ways, and the location can't be beat.  Right on Michigan Ave, its a short cab ride or a long-ish walk to the shops in one one direction and Soldier Field in the other.  If you're visiting in the summer, the park is literally across the street, and the view of the lake is perfect.   The lobby is very impressive, as you would expect from these grand old hotels, and if you get a chance, peek into the ballrooms and look up.  Really impressive - there are a lot of elements you will find throughout the property that has the charm you won't find at the more modern Hyatt convention/hotel places.  Of course the tradeoff is that rooms may be a bit smaller and the fixings are a bit dated. I had a corner room which provided great views through multiple windows, but I sense that it could be a little drafty on cold, windy winter days.  Overall though, very cozy and comfortable.  I'd recommend this hotel for out of town visitors, especially those with kids because there's room to run around in the lobby floors, and great access to the park and lake.",4
2435,"Stayed here for a business trip and had a wonderful time. Hotel was very  nice. The bed and pillows were COMFORTABLE. I could sleep there all day if I really wanted to. One thing I didn't like was that the toilet looked a like a public restroom toilet. That was a lil odd. Room service was the best. I must say, it was the best room service kinda food I've ever had. Waiter came into my room, served it on the table for me, and opened everything for me: bottles, lids, you name it. Typically, when I order room service elsewhere, the food ends up being stale and cold. But man..... my food (fish & chips) was soooo opposite of that. I know, I know... fish & chips?? Yes, fish and chips. It was GOOD! They even gave me lil tabasco bottles that were as tall as my pinkies. So cute. Shoot, the bill came out to $40. WTF? Also, had an all day meeting there. Servers were very attentive, food came in on time ALL the time. Technicians were always available for IT needs. Gym is huge! They even have a lil track surrounding the gym. That was cool. Biggest gym I've seen thus far in a hotel. I definitely would want to stay here again for next year's meeting.",5
2436,"SPENDY! Bring those credit cards! Or, bring your boyfriend's!  lol Grand building. Old hotel.  Lovely park across the street. Walking distance to the Lake Michigan walkway.   NICE VIEW & LOCATION: I stayed on the 24th Floor of the Chicago Hilton.  I learned there are 3,000 rooms.  This is supposed to be the flagship hotel for Hilton Hotels.   Good view if you can get a good angle at it.   SMALL ROOMS/SMALLER THAN THE OTHER HILTON'S: The rooms are smaller than the other Hilton Hotel rooms that I've been in; and, maybe, that's because I was paying the economy/ghetto price for my stay.   Nice because there's a Starbucks Coffee shop down on the 1st floor.   HOSPITALITY ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO PAY MORE: I used the 24th floor hospitality room the whole time I was there...not knowing that I wasn't supposed to...until the last day :)  Thanks btw.  :)   GYM & SWIMMING POOL: I used the swimming pool  early in the morning (5:00 a.m. when it opens); so, it was nice not to have kids in there.  Hotties in the gym. :) COST? WELL... If you're traveling on a budget...umm...find somewhere else.  If you're traveling on your office budget...definitely stay.",3
2437,"It's a big, huge, gigantic hotel.  It's nice and it's a lil' fancy.  Hilton's vary so much in decor and services, you never know what you're going to get.  This one is a winner.   We stayed here for two nights when we moved to Chicago before the movers arrived with our stuff.  I got a screaming rate the week of July 4th for $129 a night.  I was upgraded to the Executive level, which was nice. The bed was really comfy.  We were on the top floor with a view of the Sears Tower, so it was a great way to spend my first night in Chicago.  The room was very spacious and the bathroom was on the small side, but with good counterspace.  It's been a while since it's been updated, the bathroom has marble everywhere and gold fixtures.  It's very ""over the top"".   Not really my scene, but it was good for what it is.  I'd stay here for business, but probably not for pleasure again.",4
2438,"There is no doubt that the Hilton Chicago sits in an ideal location of Chicago. It is in walking distance from the Art Institute, Grant & Millennium Parks, the L, and likely the best coffee in Chicago,  Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea. However, the hotel itself leaves a lot to be desired. While historic and magnificent in its own right, it's functionality leaves little to be desired. I found the plumbing to be poor (low water pressure), fixtures gaudy (gold and tarnished), and sadly, the overall cleanliness questionable. I'd rather spend a bit more for the W or perhaps even settle for the hostel around the corner. Love you, Chicago. Don't love you, Hilton Chicago :(.",2
2439,"Fancy hotel. I have never seen 14 elevators all at once before, this place is pretty huge. Our room consisted of 2 beds and 2 bathrooms. Woohoo for the 2 bathrooms, although, the beds were doubles, boo! It's located downtown and walking distance to everything (restaurants, trains, parks...)",4
2440,"I was here for a Chinese New Year Celebration a couple years back and the place was a maze - you could easily get lost here - the celebration took over many different ballrooms and the staff was very friendly in handling the huge crowd and answering my silly questions of getting lost.  What makes the Sheraton most memorable for me was after a long night of eating and making polite conversation, my boyfriend (just dating at the time) and I hid away at a small bar downstairs drinking Long Islands listening to the cd that the bartender had playing and he claims that was the moment that he realized he was falling in love with me. Edit: We' just got married there.  There were some ups and downs and miscommunication, but in the end, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Robert Neubert was a pleasure to work with and helped make the day go by smoother.  Our rooms were a bit small but I love the fact that you can actually get a hotel room with two bathrooms with two double beds - what a great deal!  They also treated us to the Daley Suite for our wedding night - what a wonderful experience!",5
2441,"Booking the Hilton was sort of a crapshoot for us.  The location ended up being perfect and all the amenities matched or exceded its 4-star rating.  The pool was pretty nice but overchlorinated and not quite big enough for the demand. As far as the style of the place goes, this wasn't my type of hotel.  First of all, it is MASSIVE, a conventioners hotel for sure, and stylistically took its dedication to swank a little too seriously.  Too gilded, elegant, old-school.  Nothing personal or particularly comfortable (except the bed - no complaints there.  In fact, we WAY overslept) about it.",4
2442,"Not the best location but knowing that it's two blocks away from Lou Malnati's, I will continue to stay here over and over again. Great building and upgraded-rooms are quite nice.  Great customer service, good wireless connection, and great view of the lake.  Reasonably priced too. I highly recommend it",4
2443,Gorgeous hotel--absolutely amazing. If I ever get married this is the type of place I'd like to take the plunge at. Pricey but classy. Once went to a political event here and recently went back to meet some friends at the hotel bar. Looking good as ever.,4
2444,"This hotel is nearly as old as Chicago itself ... built in the 20's and was the largest hotel in the world when it opened.  And it's grand ... very ornate with lots of wide open spaces and marble, marble, everywhere. The service I experienced was lovely.  Although as per usual I was there on business so everything I needed was utilitarian.  But I was impressed and folks that worked for the hotel were very nice. The weird thing was the set up of the rooms.  I was ""upgraded"" to the executive floor ... 24th Floor!! ... which I thought would be cool but I guess they converted the room from 2 to 1.  There were 2 double beds (not queens) in the room, 2 closets and 2 full bathrooms!  That would have all been ok, I guess, if there had been a King. Our conference was in the main ballroom and if you are looking for a ritzy place to thow a HUGE party, give it a try.  It was fancy.  One of the speakers actually told a story of being a teenager and attending a cotillion there.  That's the kind of fancy I'm talking about. Anyway, good spot!  I'd go back!",4
2445,"close to everything...service is nice, will come back again.",4
2446,"I stayed here a couple of weeks ago for a conference. The room was very nice, with two bathrooms in the double rooms. The restaurants are pretty good, too. I had breakfast at the buffet, which was good. The bar (Kitty O'Sheas) had much better food than I expected.   The staff is very helpful. Especially the concierge desk, which got me preferred seating at a several really nice restaurants. I just told them what I was in the mood for and they got me all set up. They were much more helpful than many other concierge desks in other hotels.",5
2447,"This hotel was way too baller, but it's ideally located - a short walk from Millenium Park, the Museum Campus (where Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium are located), and Grant Park's right across the street. That is probably a huge reason for its popularity. I like how the bar is actually crackin on the weekends. Carlos the bartender had his work cut out for him on both the 3rd and 4th of July. They have complimentary ice water set out on a table so that you don't have to bother the bartender with non-alcoholic stuff (although I'm sure he would give it to you if you asked). There are an abundance of tables situated by the window for people watching, which is always fun. I don't like the fact that they charge for internet though. Everything else is already pretty expensive.",4
2448,"I like Chicago.  When I am there, I like to stay in a reasonably nice hotel close to all the hubbub. The Hilton is a decent enough Hotel.  The restaurant stinks but the lobby is beautiful and the rooms are well appointed. It's close to shopping, the El, and the convention center. Be warned, however, that the staff is a little put off by guests roaming around in their pj's on Sunday morning.  What?",4
2449,"The Hilton is one of those Grand Old Ladies that has been preserved with love and attention. I booked with Priceline for $79 (Name Your Own Price) as opposed to paying $225 per night. At $225, I'd be annoyed. At $79, I'm delighted. The staff is marginal. The front desk clerk was mildly snotty. The concierge didn't answer on my first two calls and on the third was less than helpful. Parking is $55 per night valet, and a deal (hahahahaha) for self park at $42. Drive down Wabash or park on Harrison for $19 to to $25 for 24 hours. I CANNOT STAND PARKING IN CHICAGO!!! That said, the room was surprisingly nice. I'm""m a Diamond HHonors member and the snotty desk clerk upgraded us even though she let me know that HHonors benefits did not apply to us lowly Priceline guests. We had an incredible view of the Shedd Aquarium and the Planetarium as well as Lake Michigan. I like the Hilton toiletries - they smell like rosemary. There were plenty of towels and washcloths in the bathroom. The marble sink, tub and floor were nice. The wallpaper seemed dated. The furniture was decent - it looked like a knock off of the original. The bedspread seemed kind of cheap but the pillows, chairs and sheets were decent quality. I was surprised at the OLD television. No flat screens here! The air conditioning system seemed arcacic but - WOW - it did the job.   The windows actually open! The fitness center and pool were state of the art. This is the nicest pool I have seen at a Hilton property and the fitness center is huge. The lobby is a a bit of a maze and finding the reception desk required some navigation. That said, be prepared for a loooooonnnnnnngggg walk to your room. The hotel takes up an entire city block. Add the zigs and zags of and old hotel and, well, you don't have to go to the fitness center to get your exercise.  There are plenty of elevators but be sure to get on the right one.  Some go to the lower floors, some to the upper 'Executive' floors.  BTW my 'upgrade' didn't get me Executive status. Forget dining at the Hilton. Walk 3 blocks to Panera Bread or even 2 blocks to Subway for breakfast. Walk out the backdoor to the Liquor Warehouse for beer, wine or booze. This hotel is a bit too south for many dining options but if you are a walker or don't mind paying to cab it, the location is okay. For under $100 a night, I'd stay here again.",3
2450,"Whenever I have the opportunity to recommend a hotel to anyone, I always give them the Hilton as my first choice. All the history behind this place, combined with the comfort and overpowering amenities make it a great place to stay. The bars downstairs are great, and the food in the restaurants are above standard for hotel food for sure. There is also a lounge area next to the check-in desk as you would find in most hotel lobbies, but they do an exceptional job of keeping in mind that this is a classy place. The only downfall is that it's a little far south if you're coming here soley to shop. If you're going for comfort and convenience to the loop, you are crazy if you don't consider booking.",4
2451,"A very nice Hilton property and a good location for large groups.  Generous amounts of elevators to get large groups back to their rooms between convention sessions. Overall, I am never a fan of hotel room service and there was nothing exceptional here that would change my mind.  Take a cab to restaurant locations nearby 5-10 minutes, or order in. Hey, the rooms are clean.  Beds are good.  TV's are large, and the AC works.  Cool stuff.",3
2452,"Great location, close to Museum Campus, Millenium Park and public transportation. A bus runs just outside the door. The hotel itself is a giant historic Art Decoish building with impressive chandeliers and halls. Quite a landmark even though I have to remark that I have been to more inviting looking hotels (it's size makes it a bit borg-cube-like and its all dark bricks). As many hotels in historic buildings it seemed a bit dated to me furnishing wise (a lot of carpet in that place ...) and extremely dated interior-stylewise. Curtains and carpets and all the furniture are dark and kind of Empire-ish. Most people under 40 probably feel as akward entering a room like this as I did - probably a lot of people past their 40s either! Priceline made me stay in this Hilton - would not necessary have chosen this ""grand hotel"" style - helped save the budget though. Still, I had a decent stay here. Staff was friendly, especially the room maides. They asked me and my husband every morning if we had any special wishes apart from regular cleaning. We successfully ordered anti-allergic foam pillows instead of the feathery ones. Bathrooms are spacious and all marble, pretty cool. Shower, TV, Coffeemaker and everything else worked fine. As we came to explore Chicago (in which case the hotel is not at all a bad option as it is great to walk to everywhere from here) we did not spend time in any of the fitness and restaurant facilities of the hotel. Overall very ok experience to stay there but I kind of missed a real ""soul"" of the place - especially as it obviously tries to maintains this ""historic"" image. It is a kind of anonymous atmosphere probably because of the enormous size. I would give it 3.5 or even 4 if it were not for these very dark and carpeted rooms ... the style is just not very appealing to me, therefore it is only 3 stars for the Hilton.",3
2453,"Older, but classy and opulent decor transported me back in time to the 20's.   Laced with marble, and faux gold flourishes, the lobby and registration area is impressive, especially if you're wearing heels.   With a priceline booking, I was placed on the 22nd floor, which meant I had to take the Executive Floor elevator bank...making me feel far more important than I am.   Room had spa music playing when I entered and an LCD computer featuring their new Hilton Navigator...so long guest services 3-ring binder! Typical 4 star accommodations, but it has many antique/old world furnishings that differentiate it from most other Hilton's in the states. One bitchy desk clerk too many though. Want to give it 5, but it smells old.",4
2454,"If Ashton Kutcher popped out from behind the curtains and said ""OHHHH YOU'VE BEEN PUNKED THIS IS JUST A HOLIDAY INN!!!"" I would have likely replied ""oh Ash, you scoundrel. You've done it again!"" The room was comfortable but not terribly luxurious. Just looks like any other hotel room. Paying 12 dollars for room service cereal and it's just a bowl of cereal and some milk is outrageous. No fruit, no oj, no nothing. Expensive for what it is.",2
2455,"Its a huge hotel, this Hilton. Don't get lost. If you're driving to it, parking is a bit tricky. Do not pull up in front of it on Michigan Ave. Instead, drive past, turn right, turn right again, turn right again and viola, you'll be in the right spot. Where the bellmen will help you unload your crap, point you toward self-parking or valet your piece of crap car as if it were a brand new Porsche. The rooms are standard fare for Chicago hotels of this calibre. Nothing special. Nothing negative. The resto in the lobby area is actually not bad. Pricey of course, with the normal compliment of dumbed down foodstuffs for the masses.",4
2456,"Great location. Great views. Great rooms. One star for each. Where does the 4th start come from, you ask? Well, my room had not one but two bathrooms. Two full bathrooms? Three cheers for needless excess! I really like the Hiltons in Chicago. This one in particular offers a great proximity to Grant Park, the lake, downtown, and all the museums. Excellent for people out of town that are looking to be in the thick of things. It's also great for a nice stay-cation.",4
2457,"I was in town for Lollapalooza and stayed at another hotel down the street for Friday and Saturday.  On Sunday night, I was just planning on crashing on a friend's couch.  But I looking on the web and found out someone picked up the Hilton on Priceline for $70 for Sunday night.  Sure enough, my $70 bid did it and now I had a place to cool off inbetween bands, as the Hilton is right across from the park. Couldn't ask for a better room... love the dual plugs in the lamb on each nightstand.  Totally awesome hotel layout.  Apparently the building was put up in 1929, and it looked like it was probably THE spot back in those days.  My only gripe was the overpriced ($14.95/day!!!) wifi.  Staff was excellent, though!",4
2458,"Loved this hotel! Why? I was staying here on a business trip for a trade show and sharing a room with a colleague. When I asked about an upgraded room, the front desk gal said ""no problem"". I went up to our room and it looked pretty standard. I thought to myself, ""maybe she thought being on the club level was a good enough upgrade"". And then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a door on the other side of the room that was half open. ""What is that?"", I thought. I walked over and opened the door and looked in. Woo! Hoo! It was a second bathroom!!! It was a dream to be traveling with someone and we were each able to have our own space. The best Hilton upgrade ever. Aside from that, the pub in the hotel has pretty good food (and beer). The location of the hotel was great for what we were there for. The fitness center was $15 for a day or $25 for the entire stay. At first, I hesitated. I paid the $25 and was not disappointed. It was actually a gym for people in the neighborhood. It had an indoor track and a ton of cardio machines and weights. Worth every penny.",4
2459,"I've stayed here many times over the past 25 years, but most recently stayed here on the historic evening of November 4, 2008. We had tickets to the main event at Hutchinson Field in Grant Park and really didn't want to deal with the aftermath of getting home to the north side. So I was surprisingly able to use my Hilton Points to get a free room. Check in went very smooth. The room was nice and has the free coffee maker. Oddly enough, the young republicans and a republic candidate for attorney general of cook county were occupying the ballrooms. Though most of the traffic in the hotel was press and Obama supporters. Anyway, to get back to the hotel, they did a nice job of handling the evening with security and easily getting us back into the hotel. I would recommend staying here. The views of the lake and grant park can be spectactular.",4
2460,"I stayed here last weekend for some family-time.  I was initially disappointed when I found out we'd be staying here as opposed to one of the ""hipper"" hotels in the area.  My opinion very quickly changed.  The Chicago Hilton is one of the grand dame luxury hotels in Chicago.  They've hosted a bunch of presidents, celebrities, rich folks, etc and they've got the system down pat.  Luxurious well-appointed spaces, an attentive staff, a tony location and comfortable rooms make this a great hotel.  The ball rooms are absolutely gorgeous - dripping in elegance,class and timeless beauty.  The spa, fitness center and pool/hot tubs are clean and lovely.   We booked a suite - a great upgrade at only a small price jump - and were delighted by the amount of room we had including many many windows, a Murphy bed, a bar, sweeping lake views and lots of storage.  The only downside of the room was the tiny bathroom with very little counter space.  Oh well.... I got over it.   One more thing to note - We ate in all of the restaurants (Kitty O'Shea's, Lakeside Green Lounge (the hotel bar) and The Pavilion) and found the food disappointing in each - overpriced, underwhelming, and very limited in choices.  Your best bet is to take advantage of one of the many wonderful restaurants Chicago has to offer and skip the hotel's food offerings altogether.",4
2461,"Pros: Great location across from Grant Park, easy to get a cab, starbucks across the street under the Blackstone, good food/bar options in the hotel, easily top 5 hotel gyms in the country (huge gym w/ free weights/machines, track around it all, full pool, etc...) Cons: None really, can be pricey, rooms are a little more dated than the rooms across the street at the Blackstone.",4
2462,"Came here last night for the World of Chocolates AIDS Foundation event. The decorations were gorgeous. The food was only so-so though (except for the vegetarian chili. That was awesome!). Granted, they probably had outside catering... The cool thing about the event was that I got to sample a lot of chocolate AND I got to shake Governor Quinn's hand and take a picture with him (and my friend). Too bad I forgot to ask the photographer for her contact information... Would have loved to post that picture up here on Yelp. The hotel itself isn't bad. I probably came here at least three times in the past year. The first time I was working for a destination management company, and I had to show our guests where to go. I thought it was pretty easy to navigate throughout the hotel (though I suppose it does get a little confusing with some of the elevators). The second and third times, I came as a guest. The rooms were good (had a king-sized bedroom the first time, and two queen-sized beds in my room the second). I enjoyed the amenities. The concierge was also very knowledgeable about the dining places they recommended to us (although Mercat was a disappointment, as you may read in one of my reviews).",4
2463,"I travel some for work.  When I travel I almost always travel alone so thus I eat alone, stay alone  etc.. Keep that in mind with pretty much all my reviews (unless the review is in Dallas). This is my third time staying here.  I don't know why I can't get away from staying here.  I think based on location and price this is better  then some of the choices.   Bed is comfy. Internet is fast but $19.95 a day?  really?  Come one I am not teleporting crap to my room using your broadband.  That is a bit much. about twice as much as I usually pay at hotels.. (it still overly priced hotel industry). The rooms are small and the hotel is old.  I prefer modern over old.world regal charm but oh well I am not living here only here 3-4 days at a time.   The TV is big but outdated.  (ever here of flat screens?  Well actually it is a flat screen in the room but not a plasma LCD that most people call a flat screen.  its the tube kind with an actual flat screen.  I have been here 2 days and have not turned it on yet though. bathroom is outdated but functional.  Soaps and shampoos are your typical Hilton brand.   Don't expect a view for most of the rooms.  Like I said this is my 3rd time here and every time I have a view of several other rooms outside my window.  Peeping toms holla! I am staying on the executive floor so that is at least nice.  I booked a regualr king room on http://hotels.com.  Being an HHonors member they are letting me check out at 1 free of charge which is nice but i usually get that granted anywhere I stay. Location is nice.  Close to pretty much anything and everything.  for work I do trade shows and events so McCormick is where I go when I stay here.  It is an easy bus/train ride or a pretty cheap cab ride there. They have a great fitness center.  tons of equipment and options.  They charge $15 a day or $25 for your whole stay.  Which is ok given all the choices but there is nothing on their site, or even in the hotel that says that until you get to the desk at the gym.  Would have been nice to know. And my ultimate litmus test of hotel rooms... my pet peeve.. the iron.. Their iron was cheap, not that great and the thing that I think all hotels should check for... can the iron be filled up with water in the sink without the use of a bottle or cup?.. the answer at this Hilton.. is NO.",2
2464,"Came to Chicago on March 13, day of the Green River Day Parade, for St. Patrick's Day. The hotel is festive, everyone in green and convincing everyone that walks in to do the same. The had a little booth, right in front of their Irish Bar/ Restaurant - Kitty O'Sheas-, with all things St. Patrick's (tiaras, shirts, necklaces, and more). Their energy is contagious so, of course, I go in and buy something for everyone in my party. Before we join the madness at Kitty O'Sheas, I go check-in. Lady at the counter was really nice. Check-In process took less than 5 minutes. They even had arranged all clocks at the rooms to change automatically for day light savings. Room is big, spacious, clean... so is the bathroom. Mini bar (you can ask for the key when checking-in), TV, desk, big enough closet, and more features to make your stay comfortable.  Oh, but do bring your own soap, the one they have is brutal on your nails and skin.   Back downstairs, St. Patrick's celebration has intensified. Kitty O'Sheas' is packed, with a line of people waiting outside, without and estimated seating time. Would have loved to stay and celebrate but after waking up at 6:30am, traveling without anything to eat, I needed lunch fast. So we leave, with our green accessories to another restaurant, promising ourselves we would have our green beer when we got back. At night the hotel has security, who checks your room key before allowing you into the elevators. They have a piano at the entrance, a lounge/ bar. Apparently this hotel is very popular for conventions, conferences, etc. Saw people from 3 different ones in one weekend. This might be a problem if your traveling to get away and rest. I'm sure it might be a bit quieter on non-holiday weekends but gotta love a hotel with that spirit, good service and, on top of that, close to just about everything on Michigan Ave.",4
2465,"Stayed here twice, once on business and once while sight-seeing. As others have said, it's a big, older hotel. Big means staff occasionally gets overwhelmed when everyone's arriving at the same time. Older means the rooms have dated (though nice) furniture and decor. Rooms are sizeable by downtown standards. Didn't try the fancy restaurants, but as for the others: The Irish pub was pretty good. The lobby bar was sloooow for table service. The executive lounge was patient with our group of 4 when we stayed there for 2 hours while meeting friends. Breakfast buffet was good and had huge selection but at an eye-watering price of around $30. For the price there are more modern hotels nearby. For similar old school charm I prefer the Palmer House Hilton several blocks north-- it's more conveniently located in the loop 1-2 blocks from all El lines.",3
2466,"Extra charge for wifi! That's obnoxious and out dated. Enjoyed coming here when I was a kid, the brunch was great often peppered w football affiliates. Our clerk couldn't recommend parking when there lot was full. Disappointed this visit. 2 bathrooms per room is great and the history of the hotel is exciting. I can't get over what a setback charging for internet is! Come back when its gets renovated.",2
2467,"Huge hotel. Very nice. Parking situation is a rip off($55 to valet per day or $45 to self park). Our room was large, clean and had all the amenities you'd need. We got a great deal on priceline for a room on a Saturday night of $100(plus another $23 in taxes). If I got a ""deal"" on a room I'd definitely stay here again. Great location in proximity to many restaurants, bars and parks in downtown.",4
2468,"I visited Chicago in August 2010 for the annual Market Days event in the Boy's Town district of Chicago. I was able to secure a deal on this hotel through undisclosed means, and we chose the hotel based on the history, beauty, and location of it in proximity to Michigan Avenue. We were set to arrive quite late on a Friday night. I had called earlier in the evening to inform them that I would be arriving late, but not to give away my room, as I had the reservations made in advance. I was informed that this would not be a problem. When we arrived in Chicago, the hotel's attached parking ramp seemed rather hard to find. Though this is to be expected, a head's up: parking was $43 for self and $55 valet. Before you complain, remember you are in downtown Chicago. Stay somewhere else if you don't want to pay for parking. I was immediately impressed with the gorgeous lobby area and entry area to the hotel. Anyone who can appreciate historic buildings will love this hotel. Given the lateness of our arrival, there was not much of a line, and only a few individuals working the desk, which I expected. However, I was rather dismayed to find out that the only room they had left available (I had booked a room with two queen-sized beds) was a ""parlor,"" which is simply a living room area attached to a larger suite. It has it's own bar area, TV, desk, computer, and bathroom, but only a pull-out sofa bed. It was only for one night and we were very tired. Knowing that these things happen, I grabbed the keys. I was, however, disappointed that this happened given I had called several hours prior to avoid this very thing. The parlor was more than adequate for a few people, but if I were to have had a party of 4 or more, I may have been more upset. It did slightly bother me they didn't offer any form of ""apology"" or incentive to make me feel welcome. It almost felt like a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" situation, and did not make me feel very valued. I appreciated that taxis were always available on the Michigan Avenue entrance of the hotel (consequently one of the most beautiful parts of the lobby as well). As a full-service hotel in a downtown metro, it annoys me when people complain about the nickling and diming. Yes, there is a charge for the internet, fitness center, breakfast, and items in the room. This is to be expected, and I will not knock the hotel, as it was my decision to stay here. Other reviewers would be wise to remember that. You're not getting a free buffet for your family of six at this hotel. The next day, we switched rooms to a room with two queen beds and two bathrooms (which I VERY much appreciated the next morning). The only complaint I can make about the rooms are that the windowsills had a lot of dead bugs on them, and notes advising guests to be cautious of opening the windows, lest bugs get in. Advice was noted and well-taken. The beds were nothing outstanding, surprisingly, as I do prefer a softer bed. The bathrooms had very nice gold accents and everything in the room was very well cleaned/appointed. However, when we were in the process of switching rooms, there was a VERY long line of guests, and it took 15-20 minutes to get to the front of it. I was shocked to see only two people working on a Saturday morning during Lollapalooza, which was across the street. They definitely needed more staffing both mornings I was downstairs. In summary, there are a lot of great things about this hotel. It is very historic, well maintained, and I felt a lot richer than I was staying in it. The rooms were nicely appointed and the location was great (though it's still a few blocks away from the shopping areas of Michigan Avenue). I can say, however, that I would not pay to stay here unless I were to get a good deal again, as the service, while not terrible, was very flat and apathetic. The desk agents, regardless of the time of day or night, sounded bored, uninterested, and I got a very unapproachable vibe from many of them, though they were never downright rude to me. Perhaps this is because they are trained to be ""professional"". A little smiling never hurt anyone. The Hilton in Chicago is a beautiful hotel in a great location that is simply hampered by a few rough edges. From my experience, my only complaints were being stuck in a parlor room when I was guaranteed a two queen-bed guest room and the flat service from the employees (perhaps the biggest turn off for me). I suspect that if I wanted to be obnoxious, I could've mentioned my complaints to the desk and I have may have received some sort of compensation, though I am not that kind of person and nothing about the stay (except the room issue) even remotely seemed to warrant that kind of complaining. In the grand scheme of things, I don't really consider these minor issues to be indicative of a poor hotel. We had no issues with the cleanliness or noise, and I would stay here again, though I'd make sure I found a better deal than rack rate.",3
2469,A luxury hotel at high prices.  Nice enough and good location.  How come you charge for internet access?  Even the HoJo's on I-40 offers free wireless.,2
2470,"3 or 4 stars depending on your mindset: Pros: Gym...Its pretty good Rooms...Spacious Physical plant:  Great lobby with a  very nice, old world look Restaurants:  3 or four decent places Cons: Noise:  You can hear the street, and I was on the 21st floor Location:  I personally like the area around Whitehall and the Drake better Seriously, Chicago is just a great hotel town.  In Boston the hotel would easily be in the top four....In this town, you can almost find a hotel, which matches your particular taste...So there may be better places",4
2471,"Yes it's got a lot of history, but I guess with that history and time comes a lot of stink.  Seriously, our room stunk, we were next to a kitchen (I think) but it smelled like a kitchen at an old folks home.  PLUS, we were put next to where I SWEAR the St. Louis Rams were staying because they were LOUD late at night, and early morning. Room was old, bathroom was old, I was just not impressed at all.  I was hoping for more with the money I paid.   *****The worst part?  The heater never worked in our room.  That is not a good thing in Chicago in December.  It is a good thing we spent very little time in our room, or I might have been more displeased.   Room service was overpriced for what you get too. ****The one cool thing about this place was getting to see the room that was used during The Fugitive with Harrison Ford.  So history and all that - isn't always what the hype makes it out to be.   I will go back and give another chance, but next time I will make sure they put me in a newer, more recently done room.",2
2472,"What a gorgeous Grand Ballroom. I have never stayed at the hotel, but have been to a few Indian Weddings here. The place is magnificent, beautiful, always elegant. Love the very long reception area right outside the Grand Ballroom, which has its own reception area as well. The Ballroom is just gorgeous, large, with such a beautiful balcony all around the top of the Ballroom. Love the Hotel, the Valet is super expensive though! $30 parking for a few hours!!! Crazy!!",4
2473,"My husband and I stayed here the night we eloped and got married. We stayed in a realllly high up room that overlooked the water. It was pretty rad that we could see an up close and personal view of the fireworks at the Navy Pier at night, but overall we were fairly unimpressed by the room itself. Sure it was nice, but we got charged quite a bit extra for a room with a ""view"" and the window was tiny tiny tiny. I just feel like if you're charging for a view that it should be a helluva view . Biggest pet peeve: So we get here the night we got married after we had already previously arrived to settle in, and our room is hotter than dammit at 10pm when we had definitely left the AC running. We call the front desk and tell them about it, and we were just sitting there in our fancy clothes waiting for someone to come up to fix it because we didn't want to be in the shower...or uh, consummating when they got there. So we waited 30 minutes, then 45. After 3 angry phone calls to the front desk, a very friendly serviceman arrives to fix the filter on our A/C. He then proceeds to explain what the problem was. He was nice and we were appreciative, but man, I just got married. I don't care what the problem was, just get out of my room so I can get busy. And of course, we never got any compensation or apology for the annoyance. But I'm still married, so I guess it didn't turn out to be too big of a deal, haha. Overall, the location is what would make this place worth it. Other than that, save your pennies and stay elsewhere.",2
2474,"* I am basing my review on attending a seminar here, NOT staying in a room over night. * That being said, I think the hotel is gorgeous and was impressed with the ballroom. With the seminar being in December, I was able to see their lovely X-Mas decorations which included a HUGE Christmas tree near the front desk area.",5
2475,"Not what I would expect from a downtown Hilton. The hotel is large, clean and friendly staff. I was surprised however to find the rooms had not been updated. Big old school TV's and old looking decor. Maybe that is the style of this hotel but not really my cup of tea. Also rather pricy but I suppose relativity in line with down town rates. I think I will explore and find a newer property on my next trip. The location is pretty good, either walk or take a short cab ride to just about anything in town.",3
2476,"I lucked out when I stayed here. Came into town early to tour a college with my daughter before staying longer for a work-related convention at McCormick Place. We were able to check in before the scheduled time and the kind receptionist sized me up and suggested a room with a king bed to accommodate my height. We were checked in and were able to drop off our luggage within 10 minutes. Fortunately, the internet was included for convention attendees so that wasn't a sore point for me. My daughter and I had been using the L and CTA to get around so parking wasn't an issue either. My room was on the lake side but in near the lobby. It was larger with a couch in the sitting area by the desk, four windows toward the lake, and a wet bar with a fridge. I can't complain. One event from the convention was at the Buddy Guy Legends bar down across the street. When my friend and I had enough of the Belgian beer they happened to be serving that night, we came back to Kitty O'Shea's in the Hilton and listened to some guys playing some great Celtic-style music. The sitting area in the Lakeside Green Lounge was very comfortable as well, and the park is right across the street. I like the classic old style that this hotel exudes. Sure, there are some things that might be considered out of date, but I found it to be tastefully appointed and the bed was real comfortable. I'd stay here again if I needed to be in the area.",4
2477,"This is an event posting didn't actually stay at Hotel. I  had the best time at the hotel when Bitbull was performing live at the NYE 2010. The minute I walked into this place the lobby is nice. I saw all these beautiful people this was the place to be NYE this year. The playboy bunnies were there I talked to two of them nice girls. The had live gambling for a charity at the hotel in the basement. The International ballroom had over 3,000 people in it and I was one of them. This was a paid event. I would say if I paid for the ticket I wouldn't have been so excited to be there. Bitbull came on at the last minute after NYE right when I couldn't hold it in anymore (pee pee alert). I was in the front row the jump-smokers are great ! Took some video of them dancing on stage. The drinkers were unlimited and so was the food. The food was not that great mostly pasta and pizza. I would say the bartenders were doing a great job keeping up with the orders even though  the line was a mile long. The  confetti drop was nice but they could have spent a little more money and had ballons too. What was nice is that  my boyfriend and I found his friends after an hour of searching in the crowd. We were begining to think that we wouldn't be able to  find them but finally we did! Amazing  night !",4
2478,"Going to the Internet Retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services.  First of all, from reading other reviews, now I know I got ripped @ $249 a night when Priceline folks are sniping these rooms for $79 (albiet, I got free wifi). The hotel is nice; but it can only get so nice for an oldie...no matter how much money you dump into it.  Shower head was really low (I'm 6'1""), water pressure was low.   It is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by (check out reviews on Yelp!) For some off reason I ended up with two double beds (they asked me a few times if I was traveling alone). If traveling here: 1 - make sure you get a better deal than I did 2 - confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3 - Don't have super high hopes My room was neither up to par as a business class (although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor) nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple...it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers (sp?) trying to save money.",2
2479,"Stayed here in July for a conference - it was alright, just glad I didn't have to foot the bill! I had a corner room on the rear of the building and had a view of the Sears Tower. At night it was a little noisy hearing the train pass, but I got used to it after a while. My room did not have 2 bathrooms as several others have mentioned, but I think it's because I had a corner room. The second day of my stay, the cleaning crew took my iron! I had to call for a replacement, and they had it to me in about 15 minutes. Other than that, I had no complaints.",3
2480,On the negative side: I was not impressed by the $8 for an hour of internet or $18 for a day.  So many other places offer this as a complimentary feature.  Rather put off by this cash grab. Tthe rooms were ok (probably due to when it was built in the 1920s) neither good nor bad.   On the positive side: Beautiful and historic place with a good location.   Well maintained. The common areas were positively beautiful. The biggest plus is the service - superb.  Very friendly and efficient.,3
2481,"Chicago trip tip!!! Book your hotel on priceline negotiator!  We once got the Palmer House Hilton for  70 bucks a night!   If you are lucky, you'll land there or at the Chicago Hilton. Great place to stay for a short trip to Chicago.  It is positioned right next to the park and art museum.  Within reasonable walking distance of most of the major downtown attractions.  I recommend taking a cab or the bus up to the top of the mile and walking it down, then grab a quick cab back and its worth the expense.  Especially if you go when Chicago is cold.... which is practically always!   The rooms are what you need them to be.  They are comfy, modern, and clean.  Spoil yourself and go downstairs for the breakfast buffet.  Just have them charge it to the room so you don't feel so guilty about it.   Flat screen tv in the room, ours was prob a 40 inch, maybe 45.  PC screen has free applications to cater to tourist needs and give you ideas if you run out of things to do.   BE ADVISED!  If you are taking a trip to Chicago... You will pay out the nose for parking so plan it into your budget(again, use priceline to save money so you can spend it on parking!)!  Expect 45 bucks or so a day to park at any hotel in downtown.  If you can afford it no problem.  If you can't... maybe look into parking at a commuter lot and taking the train into the city.",4
2482,Nice hotel in a great location! My only problem was the breakfast on the executive floor was too crowded and ran out of food and coffee quickly. You had to bus the tables yourself before you could sit in one. I think anybody can go up their whether they are supposed to or even are staying their because they never check to see if you are even a guest.,4
2483,"I love this historic hotel! The location on Michigan Avenue acroos from Grant Park and over-looking the lake just can't be beat!  I stayed in a 19th floor corner suite that had lake views. The rooms were standard Hilton-above average quality and cleanliness. The lobby bar was nice for evening cocktails. I liked seating at a table in the window overlooking the Michigan Avenue traffic. However, be prepared to pay around $12.00 per cocktail. The only thing I would change would be the size and quality of the executive floor amenities. The club lounge was tiny and there was always a line for beverages or snacks.  But-let me say, the executive level staff was fantastic! They helped me arrange a dinner meeting at a local restaurant. I can't wait to come back to Chicago and stay at this hotel again.",4
2484,"The reviews saying it's more a conference destination, good God you guys were right. This place was like a zoo and full of libararians and pampered chef people. I crashed in my friend's room for a night cuz I was too lazy to walk home, and... yeah, I think I like The Drake way better if I'm going to do a staycation in the future. The room I slept in was on the 11th floor and facing the direction of the train tracks which bothered my friend, but I liked it since I looove noise while I'm trying to sleep. But really.. you can hardly hear the train go by. I think this place would be perfect for tourists looking to be close to Grant Park.",2
2485,"The World According to Noelle Allergic Girl's Guide to Life HOTEL We stayed at the Chicago Hilton for the majority of our December vacation. Valet, Front Desk, Concierge and Housekeeping staff were always friendly, helpful and efficient. We had a parlor suite that overlooked Grant Park- it was rather large and spacious. There were double doors that led to our suite. Upon entering one will note the bathroom on the left, walking a few more steps one will note the living room on the right with a large sofa, large comfy chair, coffee table and huge wet bar. The wet bar was full sized (with a sink and small fridge) something you would expect to see in someone's home. In the middle of the room was a large dresser with a huge television, built in the middle of the large dresser was a fridge w/ the hotel mini bar. On the left was our King bed and a few steps away from our bed was a large desk. Our room was rather larger. There were two heaters- one in our bedroom and the other in our sitting room. From our suite there were breathtakingly beautiful views of Grant Park and the Lake, everything was covered in a blanket of snow. They also had a cutesy gingerbread house not far from the Grand Ball room. Absolutely gorgeous Christmas Tree and other floral decorations throughout the hotel. RESTAURANT Upon our arrival we ordered room service. Apparently the menu we had in our room was old. We ordered burgers with blue cheese and dessert- apple tart and chocolate cake. The food came in a reasonable amount of time. I noticed our chocolate cake was not on our tray. When bringing this to the server's attention he said- ""No, you did not order chocolate cake."" My better half asked him to look at our ticket and low and behold we did order the chocolate cake. The server said sorry and left to get our cake. It took forever for the chocolate cake to arrive. Upon closer inspection of the apple tart- we noticed the tart portion was uncooked. We sent the apple tart back and ordered the apple pie. The apple pie was dropped off quickly. Upon careful inspection we noticed more than half the crust of the apple pie was missing. So we sent back the apple pie. They really did a mess-up job on the desserts. The customer service was lacking. We called room service to speak with a manager and the person who answered the phone said we were not allowed to speak to the manager. That is when we decided to call the front desk and speak with the general manager on duty. The GM took comped the entire dinner and was sorry for the problems we encountered. We decided to no longer order from room service. GIFT SHOP, ETC Medium sized filled with things that a traveler might forget to pack- floss, nail clippers, nail polish remover. They have a good selection of gifts that sport the name ""Chicago"". Customer service was friendly. They also have a FedEx located in the hotel. A WORD TO THE WISE For a hotel of this size you would expect free internet. That is not the case. Internet costs around $20.00 for a 24 hour period. Valet Parking is around $53 dollars a day. Self Parking is around $45 dollars a day. Noelle's Notes A beautiful and historic hotel. Presidents Obama and Kennedy have stayed here.",4
2486,"Waking up naked in a kingsized bed in soft white sheets, wrapped up in a fluffy goose down comforter, with pillows strown in every direction, looking into hypnotic eyes of sea blue, is just heaven.  This was my mornings at Hilton.  I'm such a lucky girl.  Pampered and adored.  Trust me, this is not my everyday.  Nor, every month.  But for this moment... this moment was just opulent. The Hilton Chicago is very traditional in style.  Not usually my cup of tea but more, his.  Being more of an appreciator of modern / contemporary styles and decor, this would not have been my first choice, but I was won over by the spectacular views of the lake and the decadence of the hotel grounds.  Surprisingly, their room service was extremely tasty!  -1 star for no bathrobes, and another one for making us feel cheap for having to show our room key in the evenings after getting back from our nightly outings.  Very awkward. I wouldn't choose The Hilton myself per se but I'm not going to deny that my stay here was very pleasurable. I love all the spiders and their webs on all the windows.  Strange.  but I like weird.",3
2487,"GOOD: - Two bathrooms in many of the rooms (including mine).  Since I was sharing a room with a colleague, this was super-helpful and much appreciated! - Ornate and often very classy decor.  *Definitely* not the bland, sterile Hilton's I've been accustomed to elsewhere. - Free calls to 800 numbers.  A small respite from their cheap-ass nickel-and-diming I mention below. - Friendly and helpful employees. - Decent location, at least in that it's near the Shedd Aquarium and planetarium and so on.  But I wouldn't call it centrally located. BAD: - One morning, I had only lukewarm water in the shower :(. - They seem to wash towels whether you want them to or not.  That's wasteful. - Don't bother with their restaurant, Pavillion.  Very mediocre food (at best).  Fruits: hard as a rock and flavorless.  Prawn salad = four tasty prawns on top of unsurprisingly wilted greens that are sitting in about a 2 inch-deep mixture of orange juice and water (well, that's what the dressing tasted like).  Lobster bisque soup:  Where's The Beef?  Er, I mean lobster.  Even the bisque part wasn't very tasty.  In short, yuck! - As with nearly all Hiltons, it seems, you get nickeled and dimed.  They charge you $1.50 per bag checked in their storage, for crying out loud.  That's a complimentary service at *every* other hotel I've stayed at.  And $15/day for wireless?  $25 for late checkout?  $6 for the unfrigerated bottle of water on your desk?!   - Assuming it's the Hilton that caters conference lunches... YUCK!!!  Could they not have varied the sandwich choice once in five days?!  Or offered a sandwich that didn't taste like eating flavorless sawdust? - Christmas music.  24/7 in the lobbies.  Not even very good Christmas music, mind you... just schmaltzy crap on and on and on... - Beds were too soft to be comfortable. *  *  * I was conflicted between 2 and 3 stars here.  I'd say 2.5, but decided on 2 due to the crappy dining options in the hotel and the nickel-and-diming (admittedly typical in most high-end hotels, but that doesn't make it right).",2
2488,"Not sure we would have been quite as happy paying full price, but our $89 bid (for a Saturday night!) on Priceline made it worth it. According to the front desk, for $25 extra we could have snagged a lake view. Parking was ridiculous at the hotel ($45 for 24hrs) so we opted to park in a surface lot behind the hotel on Wabash for $25/24hrs. The only downfall is that you can't move your car in and out. Was just fine with us as we relied on pubic transportation anyway. Cab was $7 for 2 of us to get to the river for the Architectural cruise (at least a 20"" walk) and $12 one way to get to Second City. Not bad. The room was small, but clean. Outdated, as others had posted. Pool looked really nice although we didn't have time to try it out. Did not try the hotel restaurants either- opted for Chicago fare w/ a dog at Portillos, and deep dish pizza from Giordanos. Location-wise, it's quite a hike from Magnificent Mile shopping, but do-able if you have the time.",4
2489,"I have had a few conferences and events here now, and I'm always impressed by the interior and meeting spaces.   Never did stay here, but a great place to enjoy boring power point slides.   Only downside was a dank must basement exhibition space.  The tower suite is amazing, overlooking the lake and Grant park.  Also, save yourself the 300% markup and don't buy any food here, just walk down the street to the other chains surrounding.",5
2490,"I haven't stayed here, but last spring I wandered in off the street and walked right into the big glorious, mildly tacky ballroom. We danced. No one asked us to leave.",5
2491,"I like the Hilton...I haven't stayed there but I walk past it every time I go to school and I've eaten in both Kitty O'Shea's and in their big dining room.  I also went for a school orientation and they served a nice meal in their conference hall.  Every time I walk in there it makes me feel like I'm on vacation in some important place.  Plus...the doormen always smile at me (in a good way, not creepy) when I go past.  I'd really encourage everyone to try Kitty O'Shea's if you have the chance.  Their Irish food is authentic (as far as I know) and really really good.  Also, in the summer they have students from Ireland working there so you can experience their sexy accents.",5
2492,"I'm more of a boutique hotel kinda chick but I happen to like this hotel. This place is gnormous but it serves its purpose--accommodation only. Don't expect the doorman, the concierge, the front desk agent to go out of their way to please you. They will do their job and do it well but nothing over the top.  The best part of my stay here was our upgrade to Executive Level which entitles you to free entry to the Lounge. Woopdy-doo right? Heck, it's free appetizers, drinks, nice view...what's there to complain about?",4
2493,Thanks to travelocity  this is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  Two bathrooms per room.  Beautiful architecture in the lobby.  Only downside was the hustle on the wi-fi.,4
2494,"Stayed here for a business trip, and I'm so glad I didn't have to pay the bill myself!  I expected so much more from a Hilton hotel, but this is what I got: - Used ""refreshments"" left in my room upon arrival.  One vitamin water had been opened and was half-full, the other beverage actually had dust on the cap.  Gross!  I'm not sure how this combination is acceptable at a Hilton hotel.  When I pointed it out, I was told I had to pay for any refreshments consumed during my stay.  Um, the vitamin water was already opened and half gone when I walked in ... - Outrageous daily charge for use of the ""gym"" at the hotel.  I wouldn't really call it a gym, though.  They give you the option of paying $25 per day to use the ""gym"" or you can walk around the ""indoor track"" free of charge.  Knowing my boss was already being billed for someone else's vitamin water, I chose to walk around the track.  It's not a track!  You can't see it until you actually get past the gatekeepers who make it sound like such a luxury, but then you walk in and realize the ""gym"" is just a small collection of workout equipment and there's a make-shift ""track"" surrounding it.  And no running on the track!  Walking only, please.  Whatever.  After walking around the so-called fitness facility twice in a matter of 3 minutes (it's a really short ""track""), I decided to leave and just go running outside by the lake instead for a real workout where nobody was watching me from behind a desk to make sure I didn't hop off the walking path and pick up a dumbbell without paying the $25 fee. - Upon returning from my attempted gym adventure, my room key no longer worked.  The gentleman at the front desk informed me that it's probably because I had kept it in my pocket while running outside.  Um, where else am I supposed to keep it?  It took about 10 minutes for him to send someone else up to the room to open the door, and when that person arrived they demanded to see my ID.  Dude, my ID is in the room that's locked -- the room the key no longer opens. I'd never stay here if I had to pay for it myself.  After the experience here, I always double-check and call hotels to ask about their fitness facilities and daily gym charges.  Lesson learned, thank you for that!",2
2495,This hotel is gorgeous on the inside.  I actually have not stayed here but I went to a wedding and it was beautiful. The ballroom was a very pretty room and didn't need much decorating as well as the reception area outside the ballroom where drinks were served.  They have a winding stairway that is very old fashioned and elegant and the staff couldn't have been nicer!  I recommend this hotel to out of town guests all the time!,5
2496,"I like this hotel. The service is never good enough for me because I stay in the regular rooms. The wait at the front desk can make the stay sour even before you get into the room. But after you get in peace is yours. The rooms are clean and smell nice. The pool is great and you can do the spa thing or work out. There is also a whirl pool, but it is often full of kids on the weekends. I may be foolish to spend money on a hotel when I live in the neigborhood, but I find it essential to get away. For the ""Taste Of Chicago"" it is a convineience and for guest it is a safe place. The handicapped rooms are great for your parents if they have any available. The food is OK and expensive, but such is life in downtown hotels. I recommend this hotel for families, too.",5
2497,"i often like to stay at ""chain"" hotels, but on occasion, i like to try the chic and hip ones as well as old historical ones. this one is one of the historical chicago hotels that was worth the stay. its in the south loop area, a bit of a walk to get to all the shopping but if you're staying downtown, you're gonna be walking alot anyways. the lobby was absolutely gorgeous!!! very very friendly staff. i was taking photos of the lobby and was asked by a hotel staff if i would like a picture taken. very generous =) the room was very nice and clean. i love that the room came with two bathrooms! its perfect especially if you have multiple guests in one room.    the rooms came with one tv and coffee maker. the coffee maker was pretty cool. it makes cups, not pots. perfect so that you can control how many cups you want. the only thing i can complain about is that the picture was a bit wirey on the tv. nothing major, but it probably about time for them to upgrade their tv's. btw, i love that they stock crabtree & evelyn bath products! they smell wonderful!",3
2498,"Old world charm that nickels and dimes you the whole way through.  There are so much better places to stay in Chicago, I must say I am not a huge fan of the Hilton Chicago.  Was put in a room with a view of a brick wall without being told, and the room was so hot I had to keep the windows open in March.  HORRIBLE!",1
2499,"I have enjoyed all my stays here. Very clean, easy check in/out. I usually share a two bed two bath.",4
